Rory Lee,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL review: A beautiful mess,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/03/microsoft-lumia-950-xl-review-malaysia/,,,2016-02-03,"Windows Phone  has never had a proper champion. Not one that was on par with the big boys at Android. Much like Apple, it always banked on its “OS optimisations” to keep things running smooth despite the less than stellar specifications. This time, though, it seems  Microsoft  have come out swinging, pulling out all the stops for their latest device, the  Lumia 950 XL . Is it any good though? Well, yes and no. It does have a fantastic camera that can definitely replace your average portable camera. I guess a proper  PureView  unit will be able to do that. Plus, it has a bunch of cool concepts like  Continuum  and  Windows Hello . Unfortunately, that’s where the good news stops. The one or two things that Microsoft gets right with this smartphone simply gets overwhelmed by everything they did wrong. It is almost painful to watch something that could have been a true contender for the best smartphone of 2015, fall so hard so fast. If you’re looking for the next best smartphone, you won’t find it here. If you’re just looking for a decent smartphone, you might not find it here either. I simply can’t justify recommending this smartphone to any but the most stalwart of Windows fans. Why?"
Arif Lee,Alphabet aka Google’s parent group has just surpassed Apple to be the most valuable company,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/alphabet-aka-googles-parent-group-has-just-surpassed-apple-to-be-the-most-valuable-company/,"alphabet,apple,CNBC,google,google alphabet,Larry Page,market cap,most valuable company,Sergey Brin,stock price","Android,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-02-02,"Larry Page and Sergey Brin must be grinning from ear to ear. As Alphabet’s market cap has just breached US$ 570 billion; a good US$ 31 billion higher than Apple’s – for the time being. Stock go up and they come down so it’s too soon to tell if this will last long enough to be remembered. Posting their 2015 Q4 earnings just today, stock trading allowed their shares to balloon to a gargantuan size. Apple posted the same result last week and they’ve shown that their dominance in the smartphone market has begun to stagger. Insights from CNBC highlight that this is the first time that Alphabet (formerly Google) has snatched the title from Apple to be the most valuable company. We heard that the main MVP raking in their earnings was obviously Google, through their crazy ad revenue. For the most part their revenue has been going back into R&D; a good US$ 3.5 billion in 2015 alone. They’ve placed big bets on their moonshot projects and its autonomous cars – that make absolutely no money until they’re proper realised. Yet while being in the red in their ambitious projects, the company still made a decent US$ 23 billion in the same span of time. A reliance on just one particular product will always hurt a company when the market has (in some way) been tapped to oblivion. Of course, Apple being Apple will ride the storm and selling 74.77 million iPhones in Q4 isn’t bad, in fact, that makes some smartphone makers seem tiny in comparison. And do remember that Apple was valued at US$ 774 billion in February last year. Page and Brin both deserve credit, so do other heads of Alphabet’s portfolio but they have to continue to provide solutions to solve the world’s problems – from search engines to self-driving cars.

Rory Lee,Celcom is one upping Digi and U Mobile with their most competitive postpaid plan yet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/celcoms-first-gold-15gb-rm80-postpaid-plan/,"Celcom,Celcom FIRST Gold,Celcom FIRST Gold promo,Celcom Postpaid,Celcom Postpaid Plan,Celcom WiFi,Celcom WiFi plus,FIRST Gold,FIRST Gold promo,Players on the Field,postpaid plan","Celcom,Industry in General,Players on the Field,Promotions",2016-02-02,"As the telco war rages on,  Celcom  has revised their  FIRST Gold  plan in a bid to make their plans more competitive. This new FIRST Gold plan offers users 10GB of mobile Internet + 5GB of WiFi and unlimited free calls and SMS for only RM80 a month. This new FIRST Gold plan is a bump up from the  existing plan , offering users 10GB of mobile Internet that is split between 5GB of mobile data and 5GB of weekend data (1.25GB for every weekend) + 5GB of WiFi, compared to the existing plan’s 8GB mobile Internet (4GB mobile data + 4GB weekend data) and 4GB of WiFi. Not only that but the entire plan itself has received a price cut of RM20 working out to a theoretical RM5.33/GB of Internet. An emphasis on the theoretical part though because your Internet quota is split between three different types and even in the most ideal of situations it seems unlikely that you will be able to make full use of it all. Nevertheless, this plan also comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all networks which gives it the slight edge over Digi’s recent  promotional  SmartPlan 75 and the  U Mobile Hero P70  which only offers unlimited calls, but as those two plans are cheaper at RM75 and RM70 respectively, it definitely evens things out. Plus, if you’re counting raw 24/7 data alone, both of the plans offer 7GB mobile data, which is 2GB up from Celcom’s 5GB. But, depending on your weekend data usage, you may use more than 2GB over four weekends which would once again place the plans quite evenly with each other. You will get to bring over any unused quota (up to 5GB) to the next month though, which is a nice touch. What’s more, if you exceed RM225 on your monthly usage, Celcom will give you 1GB of bonus data and 2GB of bonus data if you exceed RM500 per month. This means you’re eligible for up to 3GB of bonus data per month if you spend more than RM500 on your monthly usage. Celcom also provides free music streaming from Yonder for 12 months to their FIRST Gold subscribers. Besides that, you can also be in the running for Celcom’s giveaway promotion where they have given out free  movie tickets  and petrol thus far. Do keep in mind that this plan is only a promotional plan, so it will be available from 2 February to 31 March 2016 only. If you’re interested, head on over to your nearest Blue Cube or Celcom Service Centre. For more information, you can head to their  website  instead. [ SOURCE ]"

Or MediaTek just hasn’t got the recipe right yet. It seems that word has gotten out that the Helio X20 chipset is facing some issues and that’ll cause manufacturers to write them off and opt for a more reliable SoCs. This news isn’t going to be well-received as the MediaTek processor were one of the three anticipated flagship chipsets that are slated to make their way in devices this year. News coming out of China have alleged that initially the X20 processor was battling Wi-Fi issues – that apparently was solved – but now people are saying that the processor is having overheating issues. That’s another flagship processor that has been (supposedly) hit by the thermal bug, as last year we saw it on the Snapdragon 810. A timeline leaked yesterday that state that this processor will be on rolling out at the end of March but with this overheating issue, that’ll be a problem for sure to stick to the schedule. Posted in Weibo, a user stated that Xiaomi, HTC and Lenovo will scrap the Helio X20 processor on their upcoming devices due to the processor’s heat issues. A debacle that some smartphone manufacturers faced when using the Snapdragon 810 chipset a year ago. You can only trust a rumour as far as you can throw it so don’t take everything at face value. But once MWC 2016 rolls around you’ll see how two smartphone makers – Zopo and Doogee – manage to handle this overheating, if any at all. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

Under the watchful eye of CEO Astro/Eric Teller – who comes from a long line of bright minds – since 2010, Google X has been toying with these high-altitude solar-powered drones for four years.  And the latest reports claims that they are testing internet-delivering drones. The report coming from the Guardian suggests that Google has been testing out these drones in New Mexico. Flight-testing is currently taking place in the Spaceport America hangar that they share with Virgin Galactic. Two aircrafts apparently exist a commercial one that can be optionally piloted named the “Centaur” and the “Solara 50″ plane that relies on solar panels. Both were supplied by Titan Aerospace that were acquired in 2014. It is reported that the Google X team is equipping these drones with technology to experiment with the millimeter-wave radio transmitters and will aim to place these drones around the world to deliver 5G internet around the globe. According to the 5G classification by the FCC, 5G speeds range from 1Gbps and 10Gbps – that’s 40 times faster than 4G LTE. For these drones to do so, the engineering team are battling with distance and signal propagation issues that come accompanied in delivering these higher frequencies. Adding this to Project Fi’s ensemble would do wonders to their cellular network but before they manage to place these millimeter-wave transceivers in smartphones, Google is placing the stationary antennas around the test site. This is pretty much a more space-age attempt compared to Google’s Project Loon balloon that hopes to do the same thing. That particular system allows 4G LTE speeds beamed down through a hot-air balloon. If you want to check out this balloon yourself, you’ll have to travel to India, New Zealand or Brazil. You can check out the Project Loon video below: With this technology, Google will provide hard to reach places with internet access. Who knows what possibilities lie beyond the horizon if you could easily get mobile signals in a base camp in Tibet or in the vast Gobi desert. We all want to be connected after all.

Alexander Wong,Buy a phone and change it anytime you want with Celcom’s NewPhone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/03/celcom-first-newphone-ownership-program/,"Celcom,Celcom First,Celcom NewPhone,Celcom NewPhone Malaysia,Celcom Zerolution,Change Phone Program,Device Protection,Installment Plan,Phone Ownership,samsung galaxy a8,Samsung Galaxy J7,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Zerolution","Android,Celcom,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,Samsung",2016-02-03,"Buying a phone outright is expensive and getting one through a contract could be troublesome with its lock-in periods. To make phone ownership easier, Celcom has introduced its NewPhone program. On the surface, this is similar to the  Maxis Zerolution program  as it lets you change phones every year for free. The Celcom NewPhone program is open to current and new Celcom customers and you can own your phone with monthly installments over 24 months. On top of that, you get to change phones for free every 12 months. Unlike Maxis, Celcom gives you the option to change phones earlier. If intend to do this before 12 months, an advance change fee will apply that ranges between RM300 to RM1,000 depending on phone model. Similar to Maxis, you are required to return your existing device in good condition. For greater peace of mind, they are also offering Device Protection which gives you coverage for damages, theft, and even water damage. For new Celcom customers (or those who have only been Celcom customers for less than a year), if you do opt for the NewPhone plan, you will be required to pay 3 months of your NewPhone’s installment upfront, which will be rebated back to you over the coming months. However, for existing customers who have been with Celcom for over a year, you will not be required to make this upfront payment. Also, if you intend to stop at any time, you have the option to keep the device while paying the balance RRP of your installment or to return the phone completely with a one-off penalty charge. When we checked, returning the Galaxy Note5 will attract a penalty charge of RM900. At the moment, Celcom NewPhone only offers Samsung devices which include the Galaxy J7, Galaxy A8, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. The Galaxy Note5 can be yours at RM125/month or RM145/month if you take up its device protection coverage. As comparison, Maxis Zerolution offers  the same model  at RM123/month (with Zerolution Upgrade) or RM146 that includes Device Protection. The key difference between this and Maxis’ Zerolution is that you can choose any plan you want to pair with your NewPhone. This means if you’re happy with your current postpaid plan, you can just add-on NewPhone even there’s an on-going device bundle contract. So if the  MaxisONE plan  isn’t your cup of tea, you can go for Celcom’s more affordable  First Gold plan  that offers 10GB of mobile data, unlimited calls and SMS for RM80/month.

Yes, a case that adds functionality to your Pebble. The TYLT VU Pulse is being kickstarted and the pledge for a single unit begins at US$ 39 (RM 164.60). Not too painful, and that’s definitely cheaper than buying a whole new watch with an HRM.   When used together, your Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel will be able to charge wirelessly too, through a Qi wireless charging pad. Charging times won’t be spectacular when wireless – two hours to full. As it’s a “case”, it’ll add 3mm to the wearable height and an overall thickness of 4.4mm. As far as straps go, it’ll be compatible with both Pebble straps as well as other 22mm watch bands. When attached, the Pebble will be able to monitor your heart rate in two modes – passive, tracks your heart’s beats every 30 minutes; while active mode takes your heart rate every 10 seconds for fitness related activities. The people behind the case state that using the heart rate monitor for one-hour in active mode will drain the battery by (roughly) 8%. Using the case won’t require any additional software, as it integrates with Pebble’s own Health app – meaning all your steps, heart rate, calories and timer will be all in one place. Though, HR info can only be accessed in the app for the time being. It’ll also support Google Fit and Apple Health if you’re not into their own system. TYLT is trying to make the case waterproof but maintains that before the actual prototypes are out – sometime in March and April – they can’t say for sure if it’ll withstand water. After they’ve hit 1,000 units, the pricing tiers will increase to US$ 44 (RM 185.69 ) and US$ 49 (RM 206.91) subsequently. Do note that the three prices mentioned are exclusive of shipping.

They just ooze cool because it isn’t just a screen or just a mirror, it’s more. It’s a screerror. Okay maybe we need to work on the name, but I digress. Anyway, this kind of tech has always been left to the tinkerers of society. Those who just a have a knack, either from some kind of training or natural born talent, for making cool things work. That said, of all the DIY smart mirrors that I’ve seen, this one easily looks the coolest. So thin, in fact, that he can still use the shelf compartment behind it to store his toiletry needs. If you peel back the panel, it looks a little less elegant, but if we’re rating his cable management out of 5 stars, I think he deserves, at least, a passing 2.5 stars. It runs on an Android API via an Amazon Fire TV Stick that is plugged into what Braun says is a “board from China” that can convert anything “in the universe” to a 40 pin display cable. The UI is equally sleek, with the skinny and minimalistic font plus generous white spacing (mirror spacing?). For now the mirror has a  Forecast  weather widget and an  Associated Press RSS  feed plus a  clock . Braun says it’s incomplete though and is currently playing with concepts like traffic, reminders and basically anything that has a Google Now card. He says that the idea is users don’t have to interact with this UI, and it updates automatically. For anything else, it’s got an  open-ended voice search  interface. Super cool. If you’d like to find out more about how he did it or build one for yourself, you can head on over to his  post  on Medium.

This time, we get an official announcement of the date — February 21 — exactly one day before MWC. And so the stage is set. Pretty darn sexy box if you ask me. Since now we have confirmation that the Unpacked event will be happening on the 21st, that means Samsung will be going head-to-head with its fellow South Korean manufacturer LG who is also holding an  event  on the same day. Clash of the titans? While we don’t think LG can even hold a candle to Samsung when it comes to sales, the flagship devices that these two giants can produce are pretty close in performance and capabilities. I mean the LG G4 is a great flagship phone and the V10 is basically a better version of the G4. In any case, it will be an interesting day to say the least as these two giants vie for media attention. It is said that the  Samsung Galaxy S7  (and its variants) will be revealed on that day itself, which we’re inclined to believe. If you’re unable to attend the event in Barcelona itself, Samsung will be holding a live stream of Unpacked on YouTube at their  channel  or their  Samsung Newsroom . The event will begin at 19:00 CET on 21 February which translates to 2 am local time on 22 February. Plus, if we’re looking at the video it looks like there might be a virtual reality stream. 360-degree video hype?

Rory Lee,The iPad Pro outsold Microsoft’s entire Surface lineup in Q4 of 2015,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/02/the-ipad-pro-outsold-microsofts-entire-surface-lineup-in-q4-of-2015/,"Android Tablet,apple,apple ipad pro,IDC,International data corporation,iOS tablet,iPad,iPad Pro,microsoft,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Pro,Surface,Surface Pro,Tablet,tablet sales,Windows tablet","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-02-02,"Ah, tablets. If a tablet was one of the characters in my sappy rom-com, it’d be the ‘one that got away’. To me, it was a novel idea where you could have your smartphone with you for the serious business stuff while your tablet showed you a good time between working hours — literally, with videos and movies or a good book — but when you actually think about it, the tablet simply isn’t practical. If you take a look at the International Data Corporation’s (IDC) latest report on their preliminary data from the IDC Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker, you’ll find the truth in my words as tablet sales are on a downward trajectory. That’s not to say it’s all doom and gloom though as their report also says that detachable tablet sales have reached an all-time high — lead by the sales of none other than the  Apple iPad Pro . Spearheading the detachable (or convertible/2-in-1) pack to finish at 8.1 million devices sold in Q4 of 2015 is Apple’s biggest iPad, the Pro, raking in just over 2 million units sold — more than Microsoft’s entire  Surface  lineup put together. That’s quite surprising if you ask me because we think that the Surface, especially the  Pro 4  is a  fantastic little 2-in-1  that can easily replace your laptop, at least for productivity anyway. On the other hand, if you look at reviews online, the iPad Pro is nothing more than a ginormous  iPad  with a flimsy looking rubber keyboard that has the word “Smart” in its name. Uh oh, am I “bashing” Apple again? Oops. I guess I was wrong then if we’re going off sales figures because Microsoft only sold about 1.6 million Surface devices in the same quarter. That’s a gigantic gap especially if you consider how many Surface devices there are on the market versus the lone iPad Pro. Quite a feat then but it’s worth noting that this is only one quarter and we’ll have to see if the iPad Pro can keep this up over the coming quarters. We can definitely see the appeal of a 2-in-1 because it brings the power of the laptop into the form-factor of a tablet. The emphasis is on power though as IDC’s findings reveal that of the Surface devices sold, more of them are of the pricier and more powerful Surface Pro line, as opposed to a more affordable Surface 3. That said, Microsoft wasn’t the biggest loser in the last quarter because that title belongs to Google. According to the IDC, Google’s recent stab at staking a claim in the convertible market was rather lackluster and that it “will require a lot more refinement to achieve any measurable success”. Oh dear. Google better get cracking on that  Chrome OS/Android operating system  if they want to carve a slice out of this market. Rounding up the report though is the sad news of the “slate” tablet’s slow demise as the entire tablet sales dropped 10.1%, from 230.1 million to 206.8 million devices. The way we see it, the problem with the slate tablet is that they’re neither here nor there. Unless you’re picking up one of Apple’s iPads (they’re leading the sales by the way at 16.1 million units shipped — 7.1 million more than the second-placed Samsung) which do offer some tablet optimisations, you’re usually stuck with either an unoptimised Android tablet or a buggy Windows tablet. Amazon’s USD50 (around RM210) Fire tablet, which runs on their own Fire OS, did come in at a surprising third place — accounting for 7.9% of the market share, beating out the likes of Lenovo and Huawei. Though IDC does note that Amazon’s success is purely based on the price of its tablet. Trying times for the tablet industry it seems, though, there is some hope in the convertible market, it looks like the slate tablet is slowly dying off. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

This time, we supposedly get a glimpse at how Samsung are addressing one of the biggest weaknesses of their previous  Galaxy S6  flagship — the battery life. According to popular leakster Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 can last 17 hours of continuous video playback “with maximum backlight” — which according to Eldra is a record for this class of devices. Video playback consumes quite a lot of battery power — especially at maximum brightness on what should be a Quad HD display. If this is true, 17 hours of continuous video playback at maximum brightness is borderline bonkers. Even tablets can’t last 17 hours of continuous video playback. We are curious how they achieved this feat, if it’s true. If we compare the Galaxy S7’s purported 3,000 mAh battery to its predecessor Galaxy S6 active’s 3,500 mAh battery you can sort of get a scale of how insane this claim seems as the Galaxy S6 active can only manage about 10-11 hours of video playback with  Netflix . What’s more, Murtazin revealed that the Galaxy S7’s battery takes 100 minutes to go from 0-100% charged which is a touch longer than the existing Galaxy S flagships, but we doubt that people will mind that if the battery can truly last as long as Murtazin claims it to be. That said, this is just a rumour with no word on the conditions of the test — for example, was this streamed or played offline — so do take it with a pinch of salt. If we add this to the list of purported specs that the Galaxy S7 is said to feature — a Snapdragon 820 SoC (and likely the Exynos 8890 in different regions), 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a 12-megapixel BRITECELL primary camera and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera (f/1.7 aperture for both) — plus waterproofing and a microSD card slot, Samsung’s next flagship looks to be a beast. The S7 is also said to come in two variants, the 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge. I guess we’ll find out if these specifications are true at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event in Barcelona. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ]"

The plan offered 30Mbps fibre broadband at RM179/month, while a faster 50Mbps connectivity can be yours at RM229/month.  While downloads are faster, many had  frown upon  its slower upload speeds. As a comparison, its original UniFi VIP plans offered symmetrical speeds (5Mbps download + 5Mbps upload or 10Mbps download + 10Mbps download). Probably after getting a lot of flak, TM has finally doubled its upload speeds on their latest plans.  The base UniFi Advance with 30Mbps download now gets 10Mbps for upload (5Mbps previously), while its higher 50Mbps plan gets 20Mbps upload (10Mbps previously). There’s no change in pricing and those who are already on UniFi Advance including BIZ users can enjoy faster speeds immediately. You can try running a  speedtest  to find out your current upload speeds. The promo price of RM179/month and RM229/month for UniFi Advance 30Mbps and 50Mbps respectively are still applicable for new sign ups today. With the latest upload speed revision, it is more enticing for existing UniFi VIP subscribers to upgrade. Note that we used the normal non-promo pricing for comparison table above.

Rory Lee,Would you use Samsung’s baked-in browser if it had an ad block plugin?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/01/would-you-use-samsungs-baked-in-browser-if-it-had-an-ad-block-plugin/,"Samsung,Samsung ad block,Samsung Ad Block Internet,Samsung adblock,Samsung Internet,Samsung Internet 4.0","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-01,"Ad blocking is not something new. It screws over some people who rely on ads to generate income so ad blocking is generally frowned upon but let’s face it, we all do it. Pop-up ads are just too annoying to not use an ad block program. While many are religious about using an ad block extension for browsing online, when it comes to mobile browsing, most don’t care anymore. Mostly because the process of installing an ad blocker on your phone is just so complicated. Well,  Samsung  wants to help you along by adding support for content and ad blocking plugins to their preinstalled web browser. This updated browser is being pushed to all Samsung phones with Android Lollipop or newer starting today. It will allow users to install helper apps that block ads from websites they visit, similar to Apple’s Safari browser in iOS 9. The first content blocker available for Samsung’s Internet app is Adblock Fast — which is supposed to be the “world’s fastest ad blocker”. Whether that claim rings true doesn’t matter because it is said that this plugin can decrease the web page load times on Android by 51 percent — makes sense since you don’t have to load the banner/popup ads on a page. Still 51% isn’t a number to scoff at. A quick search on the Google Play Store, there are several browsers with built-in ad block functions but none of them have been able to really get people to jump over from Google Chrome. Let’s see how well this does. It is available for Samsung Internet 4.0 and users can download it from the  Google Play Store  but keep in mind that the Internet version 4.0 is only being pushed out, so it may not be available on your device yet. Oh, and your device needs to be on Android Lollipop or newer. What do you guys think of this “new” function? Would you use Samsung’s Internet app over Chrome over this? Or maybe you’re already using Internet. Either way, let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE ]"

Two words that you’re going to hear us say quite a lot during this hands-on. A fully fledged Windows 10 makes its way onto the  Galaxy TabPro S . We’ve said it before, that manufacturers are going to start making use of Microsoft’s new operating system and it’s exemplified perfectly here. In the past few months there have been a couple of tablets that were released running Windows instead of Android – yes, that’s a good thing in our books. Google somewhat hindered the  Pixel C  and learning from their mistake, electronic companies are now embracing the productivity-inducing Windows OS. Tall, dark and handsome. What’s not to love? Well you could also opt for the white (knight) coloured variant but that’s all up to preference. The black drew us in better – just saying. Picking up the tablet you’ll be captivated by how compact it is: 6.3mm thin and 693 grams in weight. Even at that footprint, this sleek device manages a 12-inch Super AMOLED (2160 x 1440) screen. Holding it horizontally, you’ll find it easy on the hands and nice to hold as the sides are rounded. The body is mainly made surrounded by magnesium though the rear will have some plastic elements. Nevertheless, just because it has some plastic, it’s still quite handsome in a business fashion kind of way. On the tablet itself, you’ll find only two ports: USB Type-C and headphone jack. There’s also a single SIM-tray slot and dual-side firing speakers on either horizontal sides. On the top left, you’ll locate the power button and volume rockers that sit side by side. Sitting near the top right of the tablet is a single button that lets you go to “the start menu” when in tablet mode. Many will be shouting that Samsung could easily paste another USB Type-C slot but maybe on the TabPro S 2? Anyway, the rear and front 5-megapixel cameras are basic and will suffice for video conferencing. PLEASE, unless absolutely necessary do not take photos with this tablet. On the bottom, you’ll find a Pogo pin system that bears a resemblance to the Surface’s proprietary connectors that allow you to attach, pair and type on the included keyboard cover. In a pinch, it’ll do but you’ll notice in the picture above that when you adjust to the two different viewing angles the plastic connector strip looks a bit scary when moved. We’re not sure how durable the magnetic keyboard cover will be. Yes, it’s a large customer. When holding something that has a screen that’s 12-inches, you’re definitely holding a large slab. If you love consuming media in front of your face, this is definitely a worthy companion. Its Super AMOLED display doesn’t hurt either, allowing it to get really bright. Black pixels will be as true as can be since it’s an AMOLED panel. A fanless number thanks to the Dual-core Intel Core M processor that’s clocked to 2.2GHz, the tablet will rarely be noisy. To help with multitasking 4GB of RAM and a 128/256GB SSD is onboard as well. This Windows tablet supports a single-SIM slot that’s capable of 4G LTE Cat6 speeds. Samsung made this feature proof by making WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO enabled too. Other connectivity options include NFC and Bluetooth 4.1. Samsung shouts about the 150 minute charging time of the tablet that has a 5200mAh capacity battery but we didn’t spend enough time with it to touch bases on that. Maneuvering around the OS on the tablet was smooth with little hiccups but it didn’t have any heavy-duty apps on it in the first place. When typing on the keyboard cover, we found that it was made fairly well (aside from the plastic connectors we highlighted) but the 6-rows of full sized keys don’t really have much travel and typing won’t be the best experience. You should still tip your hats to Samsung as they included it out of the box, unlike the Surface Pro tablet. There wasn’t a lot of positive takeaways from the trackpad either, it was jumpy and when touching it, we found that it wasn’t as smooth as some of the proprietary 2-in-1 keyboards out there. Well, the South Korean tech giant decided to leave out any availability and pricing details. If you want us to base it on German pricing  sets it at €999 (RM 4,506.30). The aforementioned pricing refers to the base WiFi model while the LTE model adds another €100 (RM 451.10). And  upgrading to the Windows 10 Pro costs an additional €100 (RM 451.10). That’s a whole lot of dough to burn considering that the tried and true Surface Pro 4 (Intel Core M / 4GB RAM / 128GB Storage) costs RM 3,999 (w/ GST). That’s without the keyboard which fetches an additional RM 529 – totaling to RM 4,528. That’s a slightly more expensive but remember that the Surface Pen comes bundled. If Samsung sets the price lower than Germany’s, as they do with most of their devices sold in Malaysia, consumers will likely to try out the convertible but the thing that could deter them would be pricing. We’ll let everyone know when we manage to review this tablet – hopefully together with the add-on stylus and multi-port adapter."

The Redmi Note 3 was  announced  shortly after the  Redmi Note 2  was released in Malaysia. There are 2 variants available, with the base model getting 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Meanwhile, the higher spec model offers 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The front gets the same 5.5″ Full HD display and it also runs on a MediaTek Helio X10 processor.  For photography, the cameras are carried over from its predecessor with a 13MP main camera and a front-facing 5MP unit. The battery isn’t removable but it gets a generous 4,000mAh capacity built-in. Like most Xiaomi smartphones, this is a dual-SIM device with 4G LTE but unfortunately, it lacks a microSD expansion slot.  In China, the Redmi Note 3 is priced from 899 CNY (about RM569) to 1099 CNY (about RM695). For those who can’t wait, a couple of retailers are  selling  grey import units from RM699. So far we have no visibility of its local launch but we reckon it is likely to be after Chinese New Year. Redmi Note 3 SIRIM Certification

Dearly referred to as the “King of leakers” by the  BBC , the notorious Evan Blass aka @evleaks has been the source of all things tech online. Be warned, this man is revered by tech journalist all over and he’s someone Samsung doesn’t want nosing around their business. At it again, Mr Blass has released press renders of the two Galaxy S7 devices and we’re convinced that they’re real. Taking a closer look at the two smartphones, they don’t really look much different from their predecessors. The Galaxy S7 looks to be a smaller 5.1-inch device while the S7 edge will be a step larger at 5.5-inches. From their profile, the duo appears to be thinner than before and that’ll mean you’ll feel more glass than ever before with the metal frame taking a back seat.  Although, Blass was the same individual that claimed that Samsung was going to release not two but four models at MWC 2016 – something Samsung has never done before. Shortly after, he alleged that the manufacturer decided against it and may have been postponed to a later – likely September during their phablet season – date. The two Galaxy S7 devices look more alike than ever and the only difference – other than the size – would be the curvature of the edge tapering over the sides as expected. If we’re continuing to take evleaks word for it, the display on the two devices will be of a Super AMOLED Quad HD (2560 x 1440) resolution and include an always-on-display function (AOD) that allows the “glanceable screen” to consume only a tiny bit of battery per hour. Battery-wise the two devices will get larger lithium-ions cells too: 3000mAh on the Galaxy S7 and 3600mAh on the Galaxy S7 edge. Running its core(s) will either be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor or Exynos 8890 processor which will be region dependent.  Both phones will have 4GB RAM on board and come in two internal storage variants: 32GB and 64GB. Blass claims that the microSD will make a return on the upcoming flagships as well. On the camera front, Samsung’s BRITECELL technology is about to make its first showing and it’ll do so on the purported 12-megapixel rear sensor with an aperture of f/1.7 on both S7 smartphones. During the BBC interview that Blass gave, he candidly mentions that sometimes these smartphone makers purposely pass him information to keep the hype high. Is Samsung one of them? Well, that’s up to you to decide. Ultimately, we’ll have to wait for the 21st of February to see if Evan Blass’ leaks are the real thing though we won’t be betting against him. [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

It comes preloaded on all new LG G3 devices and displays a variety of notifications and suggestions, including recommendations to stay in touch with favourite contacts. What happened was, the app failed to validate the data presented to users, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the data and lace it with a malicious code that can be executed on affected devices. According to the researchers who found out about this vulnerability, the malicious code could be triggered when events like callback reminders or birthday notifications were displayed. An estimated 10 million LG G3s were said to be affected by this vulnerability. The researchers developed several proof-of-concept payloads including one that harvested data from the SD card, another that opens the browser to any remote site and a third that performs a denial-of-service attack that could make the user’s phone go crazy. Regardless, the are many ways this vulnerability can be exploited and that puts a lot of your personal information at risk. We have reached out to LG Malaysia to get a statement from them regarding this issue and whether or not it affects our local G3s. We will update you when we hear back from them. [ SOURCE ]"

Now, Samsung has brought these two editions of the Gear S2 Classic to the Samsung SEA Forum and we got to take a quick look at them. According to Samsung, these two versions are supposed to offer users more options to “express their style” — as most things that come in multiple designs usually do — and is set to offer a more premium outlook. But looks are all they’re offering as under the hood these smartwatches are very much the same as the current  Gear S2  Classic. The Gear S2 Classic in 18K Rose Gold is paired with an Ivory Genuine Leather Band while the Platinum version comes with a Black Genuine Leather Strap. Besides the new variants, Samsung is also expanding its watch strap and watch face collection, partnering with exclusive designers like Colombo, introducing premium watch straps for the Gear S2 as well as new watch faces including Peanuts characters and artworks from Keith Haring, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Jeremyville and Burton Morris. Both are expected to be available globally come February this year, but there is no word on its pricing.  With an 18 Karat case for the Rose Gold edition, though, we don’t expect this smartwatch to come cheap.

The report claims that  Apple  is in search for the “holy grail” of wireless charging and it might arrive as early as next year. Cutting-edge technology (as quoted from Bloomberg) would put their devices in a whole new playing field. To put it in perspective, other smartphone makers already have developed and released wireless charging mats but that’s what they are – mats. You need to physically place them on these “stations” in order to get them juiced. Apparently they want to allow charging in mid-air (like  this  company hopes to) and wants to remove the “physicality” associated with wireless charging of today. But they’ll have to deal with the charging efficiency issues that comes with charging a device further way from its charging station. The British news outlet highlights that Apple has registered numerous patents that explore the concept of “true” wireless charging. One of which is making an iMac a wireless charging hub with the device that needs some power needing to be within 1 meter – utilising NFC to do so. If Apple does do this, it’ll allow them to do away with ports altogether, making that rumour of ditching the headphone jack all the more promising. Obviously, that lighting cable has to be there but what if it didn’t? Chances are Jony Ive and Co will maintain the charging port to make way for a lighting cable audio jack but with wireless charging possible, the Verge dutifully points out that you’ll be able to listen to music while wirelessly charging your smartphone.

What started out as a promising third player in the mobile OS game was quickly shot down. In a recent  report  by the IDC, it showed that in the recent quarter, about 400 million smartphones were sold and if you compare that to Microsoft’s earnings report, only 4.5 million of them were Lumia devices. That’s 1.1% of the market share. To contrast,  Samsung  moved around 85 million devices in that same quarter. Things don’t get much better if you compare all time sales between  Android  +  iOS  and Windows, where Microsoft and Nokia only shipped 110 million devices total compared to the 4.5 billion Android and iOS devices sold in the same period. That’s only about 2.4% of the market share. And, if you look at this graph, things look like they’re going from bad to worse. I loved the Windows Phone. I spent two years of my life committed to my little Lumia 625. I loved the way it looks, the cool animations and most of all I loved the unified idea behind this new operating system. Despite all the qualms, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I convinced myself that the OS was new and it could only get better. Right? Well, I can’t say that with certainty anymore. When Windows Phone first came out, many jumped for it. Extensive investment went into the platform and developing devices for it.  Dell  took a stab with their Venue Pro,  HTC  went all-in with a pretty stellar lineup of devices (some were tempting from a looks standpoint) and even manufacturers like  LG  and Samsung had a pretty decent lineup to offer. However, as pointed out by Vlad Savov, these investments proved fruitless. Microsoft wanted to be the leading light in their own OS — understandably — and the apparent favouritism towards  Nokia  (which they later acquired) was enough to piss the other manufacturers off. Have you seen the new Lumia devices? They’re plastic slabs that are almost indistinguishable from the rest except for that Windows tramp stamp that adorns the back of the device. Gone is the inspired unibody plastic build. Missing are the funky colours that turns the phone into candy. Poof, goes that sexy subtle curve of the screen on Lumi flagships of old. Such a shame really."

With the  Galaxy S6 , the South Korean electronics company showed that they could do “premium” incredibly well and I wondered if that aspect would carry over to the Galaxy A lineup, or if it would just be a half-arsed rehash. Well, when I arrived at the launch venue floor, that thought was quickly answered. The one I was waiting to find out about. Was it going to live up to the hype? In short, yeah it did that and more. Like the Galaxy S6, the glass panels of the A series (yes all three of them) came together with the metal frame about as well as glass and metal can possibly come together. The 2.5D contoured edge glass helped with giving the side of the phone a rounded and more natural feel in the hand. Each panel was a massive fingerprint magnet, though — as glass usually is — but at least they’re Corning Gorilla Glass 4, so that should keep scratches at bay. The buttons were fantastically tactile and had a satisfying click, even the home button. The three devices are spec’d accordingly, with the smallest 4.7-inch Galaxy A3 being powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor paired with 1.5GHz on RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It is also powered by a smaller 2,300 mAh battery. On the other hand, the bigger 5.2-inch Galaxy A5 has the same processor as the Galaxy A7 — a 1.6GHz octa-core Snapdragon SoC — with the only difference being that the 5.5-inch Galaxy A7 has 3GB of RAM over the Galaxy A5’s 2GB of RAM. Performance across the board was relatively smooth, the most buttery of which is the Galaxy A7. If you place the Galaxy A3 next to either the Galaxy A5 or Galaxy A7, you will notice a slight delay when it comes to switching between multiple applications. In terms of connectivity, all 3 models support Dual-SIM and you’ll be pleased to know that the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 has a dedicated microSD slot, so you can pop in two SIM cards with no compromises. For a series separated by price and tiers, buyers would be happy to know that Samsung didn’t skimp on the camera optics. Well, not by much anyway. All three devices share the same 13-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo, except for the fact that the Galaxy A3’s snapper is missing optical image stabilisation. Though, with a large f/1.9 aperture lens I don’t foresee poor low-light performance to take too much of a hit. That said, we will have to put them through a proper camera test before passing judgement. As these are Samsung devices. it isn’t surprising that they come preloaded with some extra features. While some were fairly gimmicky, there are two features that stand out. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7. It’s supposed to be an improved version over the existing Galaxy S6 and from what we can tell, it’s pretty good. Nowhere near as snappy as a Huawei or Apple sensor, but it’s not bad. Another great feature that we were happy came over to the midrange devices was the double tap home button to quick launch the camera. It works as well as on the other flagship devices. In conclusion, these are really pretty good devices. They’re well built and look really premium but they’re expensive. Very expensive. The Galaxy A3 is priced at RM1,299 while the Galaxy A5 is priced at RM1,599. The top of the range Galaxy A7 is going for RM1,899, which is encroaching flagship price territory. To make the Galaxy A series more enticing, all 3 models will come with an extra 32GB microSD card, giving them a total of 48GB of storage out of the box. If you’re looking for something affordable, I can’t honestly recommend any of these devices. But, they do come in pink (EVEN THE CHROME AROUND THE HOME BUTTON IS PINK), so if that tickles your fancy, then these will be the devices for you."
Rory Lee,Samsung Pay is coming to Southeast Asia this year,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/02/01/samsung-pay-is-coming-to-southeast-asia-this-year/,"Android,Samsung Pay,Samsung Pay Malaysia,Samsung Pay SEA,Samsung SEA Forum","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-02-01,"Good news! You can now put that fingerprint sensor on your  Samsung  Galaxy device to, even more, use than before as the South Korean electronics giant has announced at their Samsung SEA Forum 2016 that Samsung Pay will be coming to the Southeast Asian regions this year. We’ve come to that stage in life where we use our smartphones for almost everything. Work, play, productivity, browsing and even the occasional phone call or text, can all be carried out in the palm of your hand. It’s just so much more convenient that way. Add that to the fact that smartphones now come with added security and encryption services, like the fingerprint, and you have another avenue for smartphone utilisation — paying for stuff at the store. Samsung Pay is one of these wireless, moneyless, wave-to-pay services that lets you use either of the following devices: to store your credit or debit card information and let you pay with your phone at “virtually anywhere you can swipe or tap your card”. Support for Samsung Pay is also available on the Gear S2 smartwatch. To illustrate, here’s a clever advertisement about Samsung Pay: As you can tell from the video, it’s fairly simple to get started on using this service. Simply swipe up on your phone to launch the app, pick the card you want to use, secure with your fingerprint and hover your device over the card reader to pay. Hassle free. Of course, it is likely that when this Service comes to SEA, not all banks or carriers will be supported but it is safe to assume that many of the major ones will be. As Samsung have only just announced this at their SEA Forum, there is little information on when this will actually arrive in Malaysia (or if it will at all), though Samsung has said that Singapore and Australia will be the first countries to get this service. We will keep you updated on any developments later."

A mish-mash of live tiles on Windows 8 and the desktop-loving Windows 7. Samsung is no different, trying to captivate the same market that was revitalised and made mainstream through  Microsoft’s Surface  line. If you wanted something crazily thin (only 6.3mm) that can handle Windows 10, you might want to pay attention to the  Galaxy TabPro S .  There are many comparisons to be made to the Microsoft Surface Pro series, as the Galaxy TabPro S has (roughly) the same screen size. Utilising a 12-inch sAMOLED (2160 x 1440) display and packing a Skylake (6th-gen) Dual-core Intel Core M processor clocked at 2.2GHz. Often, these fanless Core M chipsets usually get brushed off because they rarely have the computing power that the powerhouse user needs but they’ve gotten a lot better in the past few years. Accompanying that Intel SoC, are 4GB of RAM and a 128GB/256GB SSD. The tablet also supports LTE Cat 6 connectivity, WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO (as well as older bands), NFC and Bluetooth 4.1. It also betters the Surface by embracing the port of the future aka USB Type-C 3.1.  However, they only plastered one USB-C port so everything from charging, data transfers and (additional) peripherals will be solely through that one port. Maybe they didn’t learn from Apple’s Macbook that shares the solo port. Housed in a magnesium and plastic body, the 12-inch tablet only weighs 693 grams – the Surface Pro 4 weighs 786 grams. And the kicker is the detachable keyboard comes packaged with the tablet, without any extra Ringgits, making it slightly easier on your wallet. If you’re one of those people who take photos using a tablet and love having conversations via video calls, you’ll be pleased to know that there are two cameras on board: the two front and back cameras both make use of 5-megapixel sensors. Samsung hypes the battery and charging capabilities on the Galaxy TabPro S. They claim that through fast charging technology, you’ll fully charge it in 150 minutes and when full, that translates to 10 hours of battery life on that 5200mAh capacity cell. The included keyboard doubles as a case but when used, you’ll only have two fixed angle viewing – unlike that on an adjustable hinge on the Surface Pro. As a keyboard cover, it’s great to find that they managed to pack 6 rows on the full-sized typing peripheral. Also, it connects to the tablet through the Pogo pin, so that takes care of pairing and charging in one go. To further your Galaxy TabPro S experience, a multi-port adapter that includes an HDMI, USB Type-A and USB Type-C; and a Bluetooth stylus pen will be sold separately. Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S runs Windows 10 Home or Pro, pricing will be announced later in the day, we’ll keep everyone updated when we find out. It’ll come in two colour options: Black and White. For a rough estimate, Germany sells it for €999 (RM 4,506.30); upgrading to the Windows 10 Pro costs an additional €100 (RM 451.10); while the LTE model adds another €100 (RM 451.10).

Releasing the information on VentureBeat, it seems like HTC wants to make up for its lackluster devices of late and the One M10 (codename Perfume) could give it a shot. Their tip comes from someone who apparently spent time with a prototype of the device – we recommend everyone take it with of a heap of salt. It’s reported that the device will be running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow under the Sense 8.0 skin that HTC has adopted. Purportedly, the screen will size in at 5.1-inches and feature a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display. The leaker also claims that the device will carry a fingerprint scanner, in the typical home button placement as we saw in the M9+. On the inside, Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset will be running the show and it’ll be coupled with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Information from the anonymous source states that after all the OS and bloatware you’ll be left with 23GB of storage but there’s a microSD slot to mediate that. In terms of how it looks the leaker mentions that the design is still being drafted so there was no reason to talk about its aesthetics. Ultrapixels are going to make a comeback and we’re not sure how to react.  The rear camera will supposedly carry a 12-UltraPixel lens and have supported laser autofocus to dial in on images quicker. The front and rear lenses will also carry OIS. And the other big disappointment is the (rumoured) drop of BoomSound speakers. Something that we really loved and still think is the best audio listening experience on any smartphone brand.  Other than the two features that we didn’t like, it seems like HTC could make a return to the market in a big way. But it won’t come during MWC 2016 since they’ve yet to make any announcements. Meaning it’ll likely be launched at an independent event that’ll happen later. After hearing all this could you see yourself purchasing an HTC smartphone? Let us know in the comments below.

This would enable the 3 telcos to expand their reach and to provide a better internet experience for their customers.  The first agreement inked between Celcom and TM is to extend its partnership in TM’s Next-Gen Backhaul service. This would help Celcom to accelerate its 4G LTE coverage by providing a robust and high bandwidth capacity to their sites through TM’s fibre network.  Celcom taps into TM’s HSBB Network 
The next agreement is to extend’s Celcom’s access to TM’s HSBB Network. This would allow Celcom to offer High-Speed Fibre Broadband services for both home and business users, similar to Maxis and P1’s Fibre offering. About 3 years ago, Celcom did offer  Fibre Broadband  on TM’s HSBB infrastructure and there’s a possibility of them relaunching this soon.  P1’s new 4G LTE service gets a coverage boost from Celcom 
As you probably know, TM will be introducing its new  mobile 4G LTE service  this year via  P1 . In order to provide a a wide nationwide coverage from the start, Celcom has been signed as P1’s Domestic Roaming partner. This is similar to U Mobile’s Domestic Roaming arrangements with Celcom and Maxis, to cover places where U Mobile’s own 3G/4G sites are not available. So if you’re out P1’s LTE coverage, you can always rely on Celcom’s extensive coverage in Malaysia for a seamless experience. It has been mentioned that both P1 and Celcom have been conducting user trials and network tests to ensure full readiness for its launch in the first half of 2016."

A new image captured shows off specifications on the last three evolutions of the Galaxy S-line – including the upcoming Galaxy S7. Though, it’s nothing that we didn’t already know (from rumours). The slide suggests that the Galaxy S7 will front a 5.1-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display. It also states the two processor variants that has been heard many times: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 and the home-grown Exynos 8890. Also seen on the slide are the smartphone’s camera credentials – the rear only which is listed as a 12-megapixel BRITECELL sensor. They’ve dropped the 16 to 12 but apparently the new sensor takes care of low-light pictures better as it is larger to absorb more light. There will also be a steady increase in RAM with the Galaxy S7 slated to get 4GB. When considering how the device itself looks, it appears to be a placeholder. So maybe this leak could have been intentional? ‘Cause if you think about it, almost every Samsung flagship in recent times have fully leaked even before the actual launch. Sidetracking a bit, @evleaks aka Evan Blass has been busy providing more information on what the Galaxy S7 could offer. And to recap, he has mentioned that the upcoming flagship will be rated IP67 for water resistance and dust proofing, feature a microSD slot and arrive with bigger batteries. A notorious leaker with a great reputation, Blass says that the aforementioned specs are all “confirmed”. But we’ll not jump the gun just yet.

You can get free internet when you reload as little as RM10, and enjoy up to 1.5GB free each month. Nope, this isn’t your free basic internet but non-throttled internet at full speeds.  There are 3 options available which vary on reload amount and validity. For most users, a typical RM30 top up would grant you 1.5GB of free high-speed internet that’s valid for 30 days. As comparison, both  U Mobile  and  TuneTalk  offer 1GB of free high-speed internet when you top up RM30/month each month. The only cumbersome step, is you would need to redeem it manually from Digi by dialing *888*1# and you have to do it within 3 days upon reload.

Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Via, and now the latest one to join their ranks: Grab. Yup, our very own  MyTeksi  has now rebranded to Grab. While rebranding is pretty common, especially when you’re trying to expand into other regions like MyTek–ahem, Grab is, so it isn’t all that surprising. That’s all peaches and unicorn farts, but what’s gonna happen to this ad? MyTeksi not seksi anymore? Aw, shucks. Regardless, this rebrand does bring more features to the existing Grab app. In an attempt to unify their services into one platform, Grab is adding three new features to their service. No, not that kind of flash, get your head out of the gutter. What this Flash does is put every kind of vehicle (from a standard taxi to a GrabCar+) on the map. Simply hit it and it will call the nearest vehicle to you regardless of the type of ride — perfect for when you’re in a hurry. Keep in mind that Flash is currently only available in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam whereas roll out in Malaysia is set for 30 January. This service lets you input more than one credit card, or choose to pay with cash or use someone else’s verified credit card to book a ride. Once again, the multiple card function will only roll out to Malaysia in February of this year. What this does is basically keep your business rides and expenses separate from your personal ones. In-app features include the expense code, trip detail fields for tracking and expense claim purposes. Passengers can log onto the  Grab Passenger Hub  to download their consolidated business or personal statements for claims submissions purposes. You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily. You can also add a corporate card via the multiple credit card support and toggle between them easily.

If you happen to book a ride with a Grabber, that ride is on the house plus the value of the ride will be donated to charities across the region — Malaysia’s being the Mobiliti Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.

For RM120/month, you get a total of 10GB of internet and unlimited free calls on 2 separate lines.  There’s no change for the current Hero P70 postpaid plan and essentially what’s new is their new  Share 50  supplementary line.

For a family of 4, that comes out to RM55/month per person for unlimited calls with an average of 4GB of data each.  The Share 50 line is also applicable for i90 and i130 postpaid plans as well. Since the internet quota is shared, there’s no wastage as all lines will utilise internet from the same pool. So if one uses less, the other line holders will get to use more.

After just a week of releasing the  OPPO F1  in Malaysia, the manufacturer has just announced plans to release a larger-screen model of the same device. Size always matters, right? The smartphone maker announced this as it was launching the little brother in Mumbai, India. With the help of Nora Danish,  OPPO  has been marketing the F1 as a selfie smartphone and selfies always look better on a higher resolution display. That said, the OPPO F1 Plus will come with a 5.5-inch Full HD display (1920 x 1080) – upped from the 720p screen found on the original F1. And with a bigger screen, it doesn’t hurt to have more RAM so the F1 Plus adds an additional 1GB found on its sibling – making that a whopping 4GB of RAM on board. During the Mumbai announcement, they felt compelled to also let everyone know that the camera will get a “more sophisticated front camera experience”. Leaving us to believe that the current ¼-inch 8-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0 is going to get better. How? Well, in all honesty, we’ve felt for the longest time that megapixels don’t make up the whole equation – so some image processing and software enhancements could possibly do more for OPPO rather than adding more pixels to the shutter. Otherwise, the smartphone will remain the same in looks and internals. That means you’ll still find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 chipset; 16GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD; hybrid Dual-SIM (Micro and Nano) 4G LTE slot; and its 13-megapixel ISOCELL f/2.2 with Phase Detection Autofocus and a single LED. Upping the screen and resolution, could also mean that the battery might get a bump but no mention of that was brought up during the Mumbai announcement. If they decide to stick to the 2,500 mAh battery the battery life might take a big hit if maintained. When it goes on sale, the OPPO F1 Plus will retail for Rs. 26,990 (RM 1646.56) in India. In Malaysia, the smaller OPPO F1 goes for RM 1,198 and you can pick it up from their  online store .

This might be a pretty good chance for you to do so as the smartphone manufacturer are putting two of their devices on sale — the  R7 Lite  and  R1x . Both of these midrange smartphones will for RM998 from the OPPO  online store . That means an RM300 cut for the R7 Lite and an RM200 cut for the R1x. I don’t know if you would consider that a big price cut, but you if you do the math you could get about 15-25 Snack Plates from KFC during their lunch promo for that amount of money.

Camera wise, it gets a 13MP rear 8MP front snapper and is powered by a 2,320 mAh battery. On the other hand, the OPPO R1x sports pretty much the same specifications as the OPPO R7 Lite, except that it has a slightly bigger battery — at 2420 mAh — and I think a nicer design.

Or at least, that’s what Microsoft registering the domain name would imply. Give it a go, head to the URL  here  and see where you end up. This could be good and bad for the Lumia line. It’s either both of them will live like happy neighbours or one will get kicked off the street. There no point in leaning to one side yet since we haven’t seen what the Surface team can do on a smartphone. In retrospect, this could just mean Microsoft wants to pre-book the domain just in case they decide to bring a Surface Phone to live.  But since Windows 10 (Mobile) updates have been delayed and lackluster response to the Lumia 950 and 950 XL has bogged them down, a Surface Phone would be a really good idea – just make sure the software is ready before releasing it.  Okay, Microsoft? After  reviewing  the Surface Pro 4 we started to believe what Microsoft could do again and we’re still eagerly waiting for the Surface Book to arrive locally. Lumias have fallen off the truck and maybe the only that will change is through the Surface line. VentureBeat  has done some digging through Whoisology and found that the WHOIS database dates the domain acquisition sometime between August and December of 2014 – easily meaning that we’ve gone a year and a half without any substantial proof that the Surface Phone will ever exist – we’re hopeful, though. Others, figure that Panos Panay and his team will start putting out the Surface Phones by the  end of this year . If that’s true, we can’t wait! Show us what you got Microsoft.

When you sit down, you whip out your phone. When the food comes, you whip it out to post a picture what you’re eating on social media. When you want to avoid awkward conversations with that family member you’re supposed to be close with but barely remember their name, you have to whip it out. I think you get the gist. It’s a bad habit but most of us are guilty of it. Dinner time should be about the food and the people you’re having it with — especially when it is a family dinner. So, IKEA decided enough was enough and came up with an inventive solution to this particular conundrum: They created a new….table? Who would’ve thought of a smartphone-powered-steamboat-machine-table-thingamabob? I definitely didn’t. It sounds fantastic. While the table was definitely interesting, what’s equally interesting are the subjects’ responses. When they sat down, the usual routine of whipping out the smartphone begins right up until the steamboat pot is placed on the fire. One eagle-eyed observer noticed that the soup wasn’t boiling and after some clarification, hit the button and raised the steamboat platform in a futuristic sci-fi manner. Obviously, everyone started freaking out at how cool that was, but when the waiter told them to take out their phones the subjects thought it was to take pictures of the contraption. When they found out they had to place their devices into the base of the machine to power the steamboat, many were hesitant but eventually gave in to their tummies demands. The result was pretty awesome. Everyone made a whole lot more eye contact and looking at each other’s faces rather than the Zuck’s Facebook. Conversation happened with their mouths as opposed to their thumbs. Smiles were exchanged without the need for round yellow emojis. It was heartwarming, to say the least. We’re big fans of good tech and are always on our devices — for work and for play. But sometimes it’s better to just disconnect from your devices and reconnect with actual people and respond to them without needing a notification tone to prompt you. Are you guys guilty of phubbing at the dinner table? Would you be interested in a table like this? Let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE ]"

Often having those two elements lets you bend the truth a little and sometimes you’re caught saying things that don’t really add up. Google is going to make your life a little harder now since they want to help people differentiate the politicians that know their facts and those who fall short. Which side are you on? Taking place in the United States during the Presidential debates, Google will be doing this by combining their efforts with Fox News Channel – not necessarily the best news outlet. This fact-checking will utilise quotes directly from candidates; real-time Google Trends data; and face questioning from well-versed YouTube figures. Pulling this off would require a whole lot of computing and it’ll help American voters make informed decisions on who deserves their check mark. At the same time, Google thinks that it’ll allow all those running for the seat in the White House to have an even playing field to share their thoughts with the masses. So for those in the States, when you search for “Fox News Debate” you’ll get the whole shebang – quotes, photos and social messages from all those running in the race. It’ll be accompanied by trending results from alternative news sources as well and a fact checking system. The system will instantly pull a contradictory statement said by a candidate which in a debate can either sound very convincing or totally full of sh*t, whichever is based on facts and no flip-flopping. We’re glad to hear that Google has started this in the US and hope that they’ll use this again – maybe in Malaysia – when the opportunity arises. That’ll be interesting to see.

Rory Lee,"Microsoft’s new case looks good, but only on the surface",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/27/microsofts-new-case-looks-good-but-only-on-the-surface/,"flip case,microsoft,Microsoft case,Microsoft flip case,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Phone,smart phone case,smartphone case","Industry in General,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2016-01-27,"I hate flip cases. They’re horribly old fashioned and often come in colours that resemble different shades of puke. Plus, except for  HTC’s Dot View  Case, most flip cases never did anything particularly  cool . Sure you might have some practical functions, but none that doesn’t scream “ZOMG WHAT A DWEEB”. Okay, maybe I’m being a little harsh here but the point is, I would never, ever,  ever,  use a flip cover case…unless they did this. Click to enlarge So with a flip case for your smartphone, you’re often left with a lot of space on the inside of your flip case. Space which can be used to either let your toddler/cousin/nephew/niece enthusiastically doodle on, or perhaps use it as a space for you to stick photos of your loved ones — y’know like the inside of a locker door. However, neither of those are particularly practical, nor do they help you do more with your smartphone in any way. Well, it looks like the boffins at Microsoft Research — Microsoft’s research division (go figure) — seem to have figured out a brilliant way to make use of that space. Enter the  Microsoft  “Type Cover” for your phone. What they’ve done with the flip cover is line the inside of the case with an always-on, low-power display that can display “useful information”. Some examples provided by the concept includes the displaying of travel itineraries, tickets, the calendar while you’re composing an email, and (my personal favourite) a fully qwerty touch keyboard. That sounds fantastic doesn’t it? It is, until you realise that if this “inside screen” is touch sensitive and is attached to the side of your phone, how on earth are you going to type with both hands? Here’s a picture to illustrate my point: So unless you’re typing with your index fingers on the table, or if you tuck the case behind your device, it’s kind of unfeasible. Plus, if you do the latter, you might as well just use the multitasking button to switch between apps. There is promise when it comes to the full QWERTY keyboard though, but even that has it’s problems. Because if the phone/case does not have a kickstand it’ll just end up looking like this really  silly case  for a  Samsung Galaxy S6 . Either way, it looks like this is merely a concept and could do with a lot more polishing. The good news is that we might not have to wait for the rumoured “ Surface Phone ” to (hopefully) test this case out because Microsoft Research is supposedly “in deep talks” with the Lumia division to turn these flip covers into real products. What do you guys think? Is one screen enough? [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

Basically, the case allows you to record phone conversations with its internal microphone. The cover is only available for the iPhone 5 (and later) for now and allows you to record any incoming and outgoing calls made to an iPhone. There’s no app necessary; no internet and server issues; and no worries about people hacking your accounts and deleting these recordings. Of course, there are some non-ill intents for this case too. Say you’d want to record the voice of a loved one for memory’s sake or a long work related conference call to make sure you don’t miss anything. You don’t actually need to have a phone conversation to record anything so the case basically doubles as a regular voice recording device. All your recorded MP3 files are stored on the 2GB microSD that it comes with. The case also has its own battery so it won’t suck up anything from your iPhone battery. Record up to eight hours of voice playback with the case and don’t worry about not hearing conversations as the mic is able to pick up conversations up to 16 feet. The manufacturer claims that the 2GB card will allow at least 20 hours of conversations. If 2GBs isn’t enough, the case will allow bigger capacity cards too. In a less than discreet fashion, the silicone case comes in three colours (red, black and white) and the outer plastic shell comes in six colours (red, black, blue, white, yellow and green). It is made out of plastic and silicone and has apparently gone under vigorous drop (10 feet) and pressure (220 pounds) testing without a hitch. JIC charges via micro USB. To purchase a JIC case, you can head on over to their Indiegogo site. The most affordable pledge currently goes for US$ 29 (RM 123.13) without shipping. That pledge will entitle you to a JIC case, a 2GB microSD card, rechargeable battery and USB cable. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Yes? Then have you ever been too lazy to get into your car and  drive  all the way to a shop to grab a bite to eat not knowing if the food will even be good thus making the trip not worthwhile? Well, now you might not have to pull your hair out over it because popular food review app Zomato is teaming up with  Uber  to help bring you to good food. At least, we hope it’s good food. If you haven’t already heard about Zomato, it’s an app that helps you “discover” new food by providing information such as restaurant reviews and ratings as well as create your “own network of foodies for trusted recommendations”. How this works is: You launch the app and sign in to your account. Then you can scroll through a timeline-esque UI of food reviews and ratings based on your current location. Then, you can hit on whichever restaurant tickles your fancy to find out more information about the establishment. While previously it only gives you directions to the restaurant, now it will give you the option to “Ride there with Uber”. Why is this better than just launching the Uber app and inputting the destination? Well, because it happens with a single touch. Hitting the option would bring up a pickup time plus the estimated price range for the trip — just as you would find on the regular Uber app — without needing to launch a new app. Saves some time I guess? This feature has been available to Zomato users in 30+ cities across 13 countries, namely India, Australia, Canada, The UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the United States. Unfortunately, as of right now, we are still unable to get the option here in Selangor. Curious, we contacted Zomato and they told us that the function would roll out in stages. So far only users in Kuala Lumpur can access this function, with Selangor’s availability on the way soon. While I think this is pretty neat, I’ve actually never tried it before. So do let us know, if you’re a Zomato user, what you think about this little feature. If you aren’t a Zomato user, would you be interested in trying this out? The Zomato app is available on  Android ,  iOS  and  Windows ."

Drones that can sail across the surface of the water like boats are also pretty cool. Just the other day we were talking about a whole bunch of  really cool drones . But what we didn’t include was this drone. This guy, is a helicopter, a boat, AND a submarine. While drones can let you get some sick wedding shots and awesome drag racing footage, they’re also a little creepy. People can use these little things to spy on you, streaming video directly into their creepy little devices. If you thought you could escape them like you escape bees (diving in the water, in case you’ve never been chased by bees before) you’re sorely mistaken. This flying, swimming and diving device called the Loon Copter was developed by the Oakland University’s Embedded Systems Research Laboratory. It uses a barrel like body, attached to an otherwise regular quadcopter, to act as a ballast tank in a submarine. Filling it with water allows it to sink beneath the surface. It fills in a unique way that rotates the quadcopter ninety degrees in the water, so that the propellers bcome like outboard motors, allowing the drone to navigate under water. It can’t really navigate very deep bodies of water, but as this is nowhere near mass production, we can forsee it diving much deeper in the near future. When you want the drone to fly again, simply empty the tank and it will send the Loon Copter to the surface again. While, swimming and flying drones aren’t all that new, what sets this drone apart is the fact that it uses the clever ballast system. According to the project’s lead scientist, the drone can sit on the surface of the water without any energy usage, as well as change and control depth with little power and no propeller use. Currently, you can’t stream video from the Loon Copter to your smartphone — so you need to record it for playback later — but the creators have noted that future versions of this little guy could make use of acoustic modems or repeater buoys to allow for live streaming and control options. Created out of noble aspirations to help with search and rescue operations, this drone could also be misused — like all good things in life. The end result would come from the user, and while we think that it could be a little scary to give people this much flexibilty when it comes to filming spy footage, there is no denying the cool (and potentially useful) factor of this little device. That said, imagine how much easier filming the next Jaws movie will be with the Loon Copter. All you need to do is strap a fin to its side and queue the music. Dum dum, dum dum! [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

Another smartphone manufacturer has entered our waters and they’re already claiming to be this and that. This isn’t just all talk as one of the three smartphones that they outed comes with some glowing credentials – literally. So first, let’s formally introduce the brand first. Wiko Mobile is a Marseille (France) based smartphone maker that does most of their manufacturing out of China – as does everyone – but what makes them different is that there are  reports  that Shenzhen-based Tinno Mobile Technology has a (big) stake in Wiko. Perception is key and since they’re selling in Europe, showing face has been working well. Most recently, the company claims to be France’s  second largest smartphone seller ; up one spot from 2013 when they had an 18% French market share. But with appearances, accompanying specs have to be reasonable too. Make no mistake, these smartphones don’t carry amazing flagship specs but they do have a few tricks up their sleeves. Highway Pure Swarovski The first model is the most beautiful out of the bunch. As expected, you can find 16 Swarovski Zirconia stones on the device, making its volume rockers and power button extra shiny and textured.  Screen-wise there’s a 4.8-inch HD (1280 x 720) AMOLED display while its processor is a Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor clocked to 1.2GHz. As well as 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage that is  expandable up to 64GB through microSD . It’s camera sensors boast an 8-megapixel rear lens and 5-megapixel front lens. Out of the box, it runs Android Lollipop 5.0.2  Android 4.4.4 KitKat which we’re hopeful will run Lollipop in the near future . Its battery is rated at 2000 mAh. Wiko’s single-nano SIM Highway Pure is claimed to be the “slimmest” 4G smartphone as it measures just 5.1mm thick and weighs just 98 grams; we’re not sure what the Vivo X5 Max (4.75mm thin) and OPPO R5 (4.85mm thin) have to say about that. Fever Next we have their glowing number that goes simply as “Fever”. This device comes with a larger 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The screen tapers off at the edges thanks to the 2.5D glass and the sides are made with a metal frame.  Fever has an Octa-core MediaTek MT6753 processor at its heart and features 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. If you want to up the storage, there’s a microSD slot handy that can handle up to 64GBs of additional memory. Its rear camera specs are a little better with a 13-megapixel shooter at the helm while the front gets the same 5-megapixel sensor with selfie flash. As talked about earlier, when in dimly lit situations this smartphone will glow thanks to its phosphorescent lines making it easy to locate in the dark and really cool too. The battery that powers this dual-SIM 4G LTE smartphone is a 2900 mAh capacity lithium cell and it runs Android Lollipop 5.0.2 out of the box. Lenny 2 The smallest and most affordable of the bunch is the LENNY2 and for the price of RM299, the specs easy out seat any feature phone. It’ll arrive with a 5-inch FWVGA (854 x 480) screen  and a Quad-core MediaTek 6580 processor clocked to 1.3GHz. Together with the screen and chipset specifications, it’ll be coupled with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable internal storage with a microSD slot (up to 64GB). In terms of the camera sensors, you’ll find a 5-megapixel rear shutter with a 2-megapixel sensor up front. Surprisingly, given the price point, the device will be Dual-SIM (non-4G LTE) compatible and run 5.1 Android Lollipop. Wiko’s Fever goes for RM799 while the Highway Pure will cost you a little more at RM999. All three devices will arrive with a free screen protector and back casing."

Being one of the company’s first moves into the budget-premium market, the original Galaxy A series was fairly well received and Samsung hopes to replicate that success with the 2016 versions. Much like the original Galaxy A smartphones, these 2016 models feature a premium metal body that is reminiscent of the electronics giant’s flagship  Galaxy S6  smartphone. The glass panel on the backs of the devices definitely gives them an air of exceptional build quality. Today, they unveiled three phones — the  Galaxy A7 ,  Galaxy A5 , and  Galaxy A3  — which are differentiated by price. As these phones are not created as equals, the more expensive Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 have a fingerprint sensor embedded bellow the home button, a big feature that is missing on the Galaxy A3. However, they do share several key features. The first, and most notable of which, is that all three devices — even the little Galaxy A3 — sports a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture primary shooter plus a 5-megapixel f/1.9 front-facing selfie camera. What separates them is that the Galaxy A3’s primary camera unit does not have OIS while the bigger two do. All three devices also have support for dual-SIM plus an expandable microSD storage slot. Except for the Galaxy A3, the devices don’t use a hybrid-SIM set up so you can use two SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. On the Galaxy A3 you will have to sacrifice one SIM for storage expansion. The king of the hill among the Galaxy A lineup, the Galaxy A7 sports a large 5.5-inch full HD Super AMOLED display on the front of the phone. Inside, it’s powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage (via microSD up to 128GB). Giving this smartphone juice is a large 3,300 mAh battery. What is basically a shrunken version of the larger Galaxy A7, the Galaxy A5 comes in at only 5.2-inches, but sports the same Super AMOLED full HD panel found on the Galaxy A7. It packs a 1.6GHz octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. For battery, the Galaxy A5 gets a respectable 2,900 mAh unit in the back. Finally, we arrive at the runt of the family, the Galaxy A3. It comes with a small 4.7-inch HD Super AMOLED display and a quad-core 1.5GHz processor on the inside. Helping you with running apps is 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Since it’s the smallest device here, Samsung have fitted it with a small 2.300 mAh battery to keep things going. It is worth noting that none of these devices will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Instead, they will default to the older Android 5.1 Lollipop, though we do expect them to receive the Marshmallow update sometime in the future. If you want to get your hands on these three devices, the Galaxy A7 will go for RM1,899 while the Galaxy A5 retails for RM1,599 and the Galaxy A3 will set you back RM1,299 including GST. All of these devices can be purchased at the official Samsung retailers from 28 January onwards. All purchases will be bundled with a 32GB microSD card free of charge. The devices will come in four colours — Black, Gold, White and Pink Gold.   From today until 31 January 2016, there will be a roadshow at Sunway Pyramid’s Blue Concourse for the general public to experience the features that the Galaxy A Series 2016 has to offer. A number of units are up for grabs for lucky winners. For more information please visit Samsung’s  website ."

Well, sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans have revealed to the Verge that the new Word Flow keyboard will feature a unique one-handed typing experience that will surely appeal to  fans  of both iOS and Word Flow. While most keyboards, the Windows Phone version of Word Flow included, have support for one-handed typing — mighty useful on the phablets of today. But, while other one-handed typing modes resemble squashed keyboards, this one fans out. Yup, it can be anchored either on the right or the left side of the device, but then it fans out in a quarter-circle shape which is supposed to make it easier for users to swipe/type one-handed with their thumb. That makes sense if you pick up your phone and try to type on it with one hand. Reaching the Q button was always a stretch, but now it seems a lot more plausible. Other than the one-handed mode, everything else seems to be every similar to the Windows Phone version. You have access to word suggestions, emoji and swipe letters. We’re definitely interested in trying this out. It seems the trend of Microsoft making better apps for other people is continuing with their record-breaking keyboard.

Arif Lee,Here’s proof that the Facebook app is bad for your smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/27/heres-proof-that-the-facebook-app-is-bad-for-your-smartphone/,"5 reasons to ditch the Facebook app,5 reasons to use web browser,Facebook,Facebook Android App,facebook app,Facebook Application,Facebook effects smartphone performance,Facebook makes phone slow,Facebook Mobile Web Browser,Facebook web browser,pbrandes_eth,reddit","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-27,"A week back we gave you  5 reasons why you should ditch the Facebook app  and while the reasons were substantial and logical, there was never any math involved. Nothing was really based on hard research at that time.  Now a Reddit user going by the name “ pbrandes_eth ” has drawn up a scientific approach to see how the  Facebook  app “kills” your device. And the evidence says pretty much the same thing. Many have called it a hogger of resources when installed, bugs out and sometimes just fails to work. Facebook hasn’t even changed the looks of the app since material design is all the rage now – with Marshmallow in play. Monitoring how detrimental the Facebook app is on an LG G4, the Reddit user used DiscoMark’s benchmark and ran 13 test – with and without Facebook – to see the differences in performance. After the tests, he found that there was a 15% performance difference. That’s hard facts, no placebo nonsense. It’s pretty obvious that adding/removing any app on your device is going to affect the performance of the CPU but the fact is, why is an app that is only 39MB in size, accounting for such a big gap in performance? We can only think of the bloated coding that was mentioned by a Facebook engineer in the past. A realisation hit me that our reliance on Facebook goes much deeper than just social interactions. ‘Cause if it wasn’t for Zuckerberg, there would be many happy memories forgotten. Posing me to think that if we have to rely on it, at least, be smart of how to make it more efficient – or, at least, make our own experience with the social media platform better. Well, now you have it, don’t want your smartphone to be handicapped further than it usually is, uninstall the Facebook app and use it on your browser instead.

Rory Lee,honor 5X hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/honor-5x-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Honor 5X,honor 5X first impressions,honor 5X hands on,honor 5X launch,honor 5X launch Malaysia,Honor Malaysia,Huawei Malaysia","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-26,"Many have been waiting for the arrival of the  honor 5X  on local shores, and it isn’t particularly hard to see why. A metal build, a nice full HD display and a snappy fingerprint sensor are hard to come by at this end of the market. While honor have not announced when the device will go on sale or how much it would cost, we got to take a quick look at this all-metal midrange device. A premium metal construction is almost a necessity these days. While  we don’t think  that a metal body is all that, smartphone manufacturers and people who want to show off certainly do. Has honor delivered with the 5X? Well, I can tell you that it definitely feels better than the more expensive honor 7. The front of the device is nothing to shout about, but when you move to the sides of the device, you can see where all of honor’s effort went. They talked endlessly about the sandblasting they had to do to keep the device feeling smooth in the hand and they did accomplish that to a certain extent. The sides are nicely chamfered (ala-Nexus 6P) to help with grip and very smooth to the touch. They decided to go with a brushed metal look for the back plate but the moment your fingers touch it, the panel feels in no way shape or form brushed. It was smooth as a baby’s bottom — which may appeal to some, but I like a little grain and roughness. There are other niggles that come from the buttons. While they had nice tactile feedback which felt really premium, the power button shifts around a little too much and if you apply pressure to the center of the volume rockers you will be greeted with an incredibly unpleasant flex. Since this isn’t really a high-end device, you can’t really expect much when it comes to performance. It sports a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. With proper optimisation, those specs would do fine for light to medium tasks, but from our brief hands-on it doesn’t seem to be the case. Switching between applications was slow and sluggish. Exiting the camera app was the most painful thing to watch as the frames stuttered and choked. It was a disaster. That said, this can probably be fixed with a quick update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The honor 5X comes with a decent 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with a dual-LED flash mounted on the rear, right above the fingerprint scanner. It’s a pretty decent snapper with a host of features as is the hallmark of EMUI’s camera app. Stuff like beautification, HDR, panorama are all bundled into it. Shots from that sensor are decent with reasonable amounts of colour accuracy and detail. The front 5MP f/2.4 selfie cam also takes reasonably good pictures, though we would have liked if it was a little wider for those crucial wefies. Its Huawei-made fingerprint scanner is as fantastic as ever. I loved the accuracy and speed though I would have appreciated a little haptic feedback when it successfully reads your finger but that’s me nitpicking. The honor 5X’s sensor only needs 6 taps to register your fingerprint yet it has an amazing level of accuracy. As is a common theme in Huawei made devices, the fingerprint scanner at the back is more than simply a fingerprint scanner. You can swipe down on it to pull down your notifications, as well as hold it to exit your application and return to the home screen. It also allows you to take photos by tapping it though we found that quite pointless and horribly unergonomic. It also has a curious function that lets the fingerprint scanner act as a back button allowing you to tap it once to go back to your previous task. So what if I’ve enabled the camera single tap to take a photo? Design oversight? It also lacks the swipe left and swipe right to scroll through pictures or text. All in all, it’s a pretty decent budget premium device with an okay camera and decent specs. All it needs is some proper optimisation (please patch ASAP) and a little skill when taking photographs. It’s a decent all-rounder but it faces tough competition from the likes of the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 2  and the  Redmi Note 3  (when it arrives) even if our estimate of a sub RM1,000 price tag comes true."
Arif Lee,Can Uber replace your car?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/can-uber-replace-your-car-uber-challenge/,,,2016-01-26,"What’s your preferred way of getting around? Do you make use of public transport or rely on your own car? The way we travel is usually dictated by a handful of factors: safety, convenience, travel time, comfort and price. Well since  Uber  came into the picture, most Klang Valley folks have decided to jump on the ride-sharing app that allows you to request rides at a moment’s notice.  You’ll be able to hop on and off without fumbling over small change because payments are channeled through credit/debit card. Just recently, they have revised their uberX rates and it’s now  up to 50% more affordable  than before. As a result, they reckon it is cheaper to rely on Uber as a daily driver compared to owning a car. This could be  possible once you consider the cost associated with parking, maintenance, fuel, road tax and insurance renewals of a vehicle on a weekly basis. To see if this is possible, we’ll be putting their claims to the test. For a week,  Rory  and I ( Arif ) will rely entirely on Uber to get around.  He’ll be commuting from his home in Bukit Puchong, while I’ll be getting around from mine, in Bukit Damansara. The difference in location will be the main variable here – suburbs vs city. On top of that, we’ll also look at how reliable, convenient and comfortable Uber is opposed to driving.  We’re looking at a big difference in travel time(s) for both of us. He takes anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get to work. As for me, I’ll take about 15 minutes to 30 minutes. In terms of fuel, he forks out roughly RM65 weekly and RM20 on tolls. My end that works out to RM40 and RM5, respectively We’ll be keeping you updated on our progress daily and can’t wait to share our experience with you."

At first, it was  TM  with their  UniFi + iflix plan , then now it seems that it’s  Digi ‘s turn. The telco is offering a 12-month iflix subscription (worth RM96) to its subscribers for free. Unfortunately, this deal isn’t for every Digi subscriber as it is only applicable for those under the Digi SmartPlan 65 banner or higher. If you aren’t one now though, from today onwards you can sign up or upgrade to the SmartPlan 65 (or any higher plan) and get this very offer as well. But there’s more. This deal is supposedly limited and it will operate on a first come first served basis which means that if you want to take advantage of this free year of iflix, it would probably be wise to act soon. That said, Digi never specified a specific “limit” to this offer — no dates, no number of customers, nothing. Could this be a marketing strategy to generate hype? Well, if it is, this wouldn’t be the first time Malaysians have been lured in by the word “free” and “limited”. Let’s just say we like free things. In any case, much like the TM deal, this one requires no login because Digi has “back-end” integration with iflix allowing the streaming service to automatically detect if you’re on a Digi line and grant you unrestricted access to their library. All you need to do is download the app (via a Digi network) on either  iOS  or  Android , and launch it. iflix will take care of the rest. Plus you get 1GB of extra quota (until March 2016) to watch iflix content. If you’re not interested in upgrading to a Digi SmartPlan 65 or higher, you can still opt to retain the 60-days free subscription with iflix that is the result of the first collaboration between the telco and the streaming service. For those who are curious, Digi’s SmartPlan 65 offers two variants — one that has unlimited calls to all networks plus 3GB of data, versus one that has 5GB of data and only 200mins of free calls. For more information on this plan, you can head on over  here . For more information on the iflix deal, please direct your browser to  this site .

So this “little brother” is something to be reckoned with – if the rumours are true. A video surfaced last week, showing off what looks like a smaller iPhone 6(s) and people think it’ll slot in at 4-inches. The compact package will also apparently arrive with a 16 GB entry-level internal storage, moving up all the way to 64 GB. Making smaller phones could allow Apple to re-enter the smaller device market that has people with smaller hands fumbling and tumbling their larger devices in recent times. And it fuels Microsoft’s keyboard beta-testing for iOS that allows easier one-handed texting. We just hope that making it smaller might allow Cupertino to slash prices if they want to be seen as a competitor in the “more affordable” market. Countries in Asia could benefit the most, together with some European states also having the majority of their citizens opting for more affordable devices. Prices of iPhones have skyrocketed through the roof in the past few generations with increments getting out of hand. Could selling a smaller iPhone allow them to price it closer to the other top end devices and earn them an even larger market share? If you didn’t know, Apple still rakes in the  most revenue  since their profit margins are a lot higher. Other rumours have come along too with many pointing to OLED screens,  waterproof-ability  and even  ditching  the headphone jack on the next generation of iDevices. All rumours and none of them facts. Anything Apple decides, they’ll likely pull it off. Unless they’re going to sell another Smart Battery Case, which is reminiscent of a camel’s hump.

To get one officially would probably take months but a couple of grey importers in Malaysia have started to selling the metal unibody smartphone. Like most imported handsets, the first wave of Redmi 3 stocks won’t be too friendly on your wallet. Retailers  Satu Gadget  and  DirectD  have started selling the Redmi 3 at RM688 and RM699 respectively, which is pretty steep compared to its original asking price in China that goes for 699 CNY (RM452 with current exchange rate). In fact, you can get the bigger and better  Redmi Note 3  from as low as  RM699  for the low spec 2GB RAM + 16GB storage model. That gets a faster Helio X10 processor, full HD 5.5″ display and it even comes with a fingerprint scanner at the rear. The only feature disadvantage of the Redmi Note 3 is the lack of a microSD expansion slot. To refresh your memory on the smaller  Redmi 3 , the budget unibody metal device gets a 5″ 720p display and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. You can add a microSD card up to 128GB on its hybrid Dual-SIM slot and powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh battery that supports 5V/2A fast charging. In terms of imaging, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 rear camera and a front-facing 5MP f/2.2 unit for your selfie needs. If Xiaomi sells this officially in our market, we reckon that it should go below RM600.

Wholly, LG made some profit but their mobile division failed to bear fruit losing roughly US$ 39 million. During the last quarter, they sold 15.3 million smartphones ending the year with only 59.7 million units sold – numbers that pale in comparison to their competitors. While that’s all the same, their latest results does better themselves when they sold 59.1 devices in 2014. Many have pointed towards the success of the V10 when launched in certain markets. The tech multinational foresees that competition in the smartphone segment is going to be real stiff. They anticipate that pricing and  is going to be a key factor in this space. The same can be said for the cost of premium materials and better processors slowly dipping.  Touching on the topic of newer OEMs gaining traction by packing all they can in their devices, LG is probably realising that Huawei and Xiaomi are a big threat. Now at least, they’re recognising that publically and have assured that their lower to mid-range devices will get some new additions as well. It’s clear that the one of those flagships will be released during MWC 2016, with a February 21st announcement date already written in the books. They’ve been many rumours with some going as far as suggesting a modular battery slot. Well, whatever the case, come February LG will be in a stare down with Samsung to see which flagship gets more attention. It’ll be a battle of South Korea and we can’t wait to see who puts out a better device. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

To me, it’s a hotly debated issue that stems from the history of intelligence agencies spying on their nation’s citizens. In most cases, it’s to protect a country’s interest and to ensure the safety of their people. Uber  has decided to go big brother and began monitoring how drivers are driving since late last year.  The Verge  points out that this isn’t their first rodeo as they’ve tracked drivers in China during the unruly protests that were happening in Eastern China. Now it’s taken that isolated situation a step further in a bid to safeguard passenger safety by using gyrometers, GPS signals and accelerometers in driver’s smartphones. CSO (Chief Security Officer) of Uber, Joe Sullivan says that they’re doing this because “If a rider complains that a driver accelerated too fast and braked too hard, we can review that trip using data”. The ride-sharing platform will utilise gyrometer data to see if those behind the wheel are moving their smartphones too much while driving. That means more time looking fumbling with their devices and less time looking at the road. Speeding will be monitored too, by using technology to take note of the average time between two points and calculating if the drivers being too friendly with that accelerator – so to speak. Digging up some extra info on the subject, the Guardian has narrowed down where this monitoring is taking place – Houston, Texas. It’s no question that these experiments will only help Uber maintain rider satisfaction and safety above all else but also will help provide proof to any bad ratings; justifying why a one-star rating was given – if it was because of reckless driving. Providing a case for both the driver and rider in the scenario of an accusation. We’re sure that Uber partners/drivers won’t be happy having someone watching their every turn (figuratively) and as a  class-action lawsuit  has been filed in the Bay Area demanding for equal rights – drivers might not have to put up with this for long.

Some said there could be as many as  four models  launched at the same time while others dismissed that right out of the bat. There was never any official confirmation beyond an  entry  in the Indonesian certification agency (which has been removed) and an  exclusive  by SamMobile. Now, though, thanks to Indian import-export tracker Zauba, we at least have confirmation of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge’s screen sizes. 
 Click to enlarge Based on this listing, the two devices bearing the model number SM-G930R4 and SM-G935R4 — which is the Galaxy S7 and  S7 edge  respectively — have been listed to pack a 5.1-inch screen for the S7 and a 5.5-inch screen for the S7 edge. This reflects the earlier  specifications  outed by popular benchmark AnTuTu. Plus, since only two models have been imported, it is becoming less and less likely that Samsung will launch four devices at the same time. Then again, smartphone manufacturers have done crazier things. Though, it is worth noting that only two of each device have been imported, probably because they’re tester units (as can be seen in the description “FOR TESTNG”). Based on most leaks, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge should come with a Quad HD display packing either an Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 processor (likely depending on region) plus 4GB of RAM and either 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB of expandable internal storage. Yes, there will be a microSD card slot. The camera will probably be a 12-megapixel BRITECELL rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing selfie cam. These devices should also have support for Cat.12/13 LTE connectivity and a USB Type-C port. They should also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. If you’d like to catch up on what we know about the new Galaxy S lineup, you can find more info  here  and  here . We will definitely know more once Samsung’s Unpacked event in Barcelona which will take place in February. Until then, these specifications could change — though we think unlikely because they match up with our earlier  report  on the Indonesian certification agency — so don’t follow them blindly.

Our own device (also from the US) has for the past week and, for the longest time, nobody claimed responsibility or could even identify what was wrong with the device. Well, thanks to our knights in shining armour over at Android Authority and Techradar, we now have an answer. After picking up the story about the bootloop issues from LG G4 users, Android Authority gathered what they knew and confronted LG about it. Thankfully, instead of denying any problems the electronics giant admitted that there was a problem with the smartphone’s hardware and said that they would repair the affected devices, though it is unclear if your device needs to still be under warranty for it to be eligible. The problem puts the phone in a boot-up loop where it tries to reset, fails and tries again and again which then proceeds to brick the phone. We thought it was a problem with our device’s battery, but now according to  LG , it is resulting from “loose contact between components”. Currently, it is unclear if this problem affects all LG G4s or if it is just limited to those units in the US. However, according to Android Authority, the bootloop issue persists and affects all regional and carrier models of the device. LG advises its customers who have bought their devices via a carrier and are experiencing such issues to contact their nearest LG Service Center for repair under full warranty. On the other hand, customers who have purchased their G4 smartphones from non-carrier retailers should contact an LG Service Center “with the understanding that warranty conditions will differ”. We don’t know if this problem affects local Malaysian units, so if you are using a local LG G4, do let us know if you’re experiencing such problems. We’ve contacted LG Malaysia ourselves and we’ll keep you updated on their response. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

Does it make you a thief? Or is your house just bringing bad GPS-related luck? We dig deeper into this mysterious case that has a couple in Atlanta constantly having find my phone-like apps bring people to their house. Make no mistake, this duo is not the Bonnie and Clyde of the smartphone industry. They’ve just bought the wrong house. This all began when Christina Lee and Michael Saba moved in together. The following months they started getting odd “visits” from people looking for their smartphones, stating that their phone-tracking apps lead them to this geolocation. So put yourself in their shoes. At every time of day having people bang on your door sometimes accompanied by policemen, asking to search your house for their missing smartphone. Yikes, after the third time we’d move out immediately if it was us. They’ve been through about a dozen accusations and every time they need to explain that “I’m sorry you came all this way. This happens a lot”. Often people take their word but there are times where the accusers fail to believe them. The couple has tried to understand why they keep facing this but their attempts to connect the dots have been in vain. These stolen phones have no real commonality between them. They’re on different cellular networks. While some are Androids and some are iPhones. An official complaint has been filed to their local police department too but it’s all the same. A case as interesting as this isn’t the first time that “Find my phone” apps have failed to give the correct location of where these stolen phones are. Some experts claim that it’s associated with cell tower triangulation – a problem that has been exhibited before in another state.

Rory Lee,Popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter finally has an Android app,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/22/popular-crowdfunding-site-kickstarter-finally-has-an-android-app/,"Android,crowdfunding,crowdfunding app,Google Play Store,Kickstarter,Kickstarter Android app,Kickstarter app,Play Store,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Industry in General,Kickstarter,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-22,"Kickstarter  projects are growing by the day. Some of the things you can find there are nothing short of amazing, from camera control modules, to remote-controlled paper planes, to movies and even smartwatches. With such a large following though it seems weird that Kickstarter never brought their application to the Google Play Store — until now. It does seem odd that Kickstarter left the Android platform without an app for so long, but maybe they were caught up with something. Well, they clearly got around to doing so eventually, but it appears some key functions missing. With the Android app, you can discover and pledge for projects as well as get updates from your backed projects. You can also connect with your friends to see what they’re backing. As something for you to browse the wealth of Kickstarter’s library, this application is pretty decent then. However, if you’re a project creator, your hands are tied. You would have to resort to the browser version because the application will not allow you to manage your projects with it. It seems a little silly that such a feature was left out front the start and would only be coming in the future, but I guess if you consider the number of backers versus the number of creators, that percentage is pretty lopsided. Kickstarter could instead just make another app specially for creators — like what Facebook does with its  Pages Manager  app — though that seems unlikely especially if you’re looking at the  iOS app . If you’re a big Kickstarter user, definitely try the app out (you can download it  here ) and definitely let us know what you think about it versus the browser version or even the iOS version.

Rory Lee,The honor 5X and honor 7 Enhanced have hit Malaysian shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/the-honor-5x-and-honor-7-enhanced-have-hit-malaysian-shores/,"Honor,Honor 5X,honor 5X launch Malaysia,honor 5X official Malaysia,Honor 7,honor 7 Enhanced,honor 7 Enhanced launch Malaysia,honor launch Malaysia,honor malaysia official,huawei","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-26,"Two brand new honor smartphones have been officially unveiled in Malaysia — the  honor 5X  and the  honor 7 Enhanced  — and they’re poised to take the local midrange smartphone market by storm. The honor 5X is the much anticipated budget-midrange smartphone from the Chinese company that looks to take on Xiaomi’s very own device in that class — the Redmi Note 3. Clad in an all-metal unibody, the honor 5X comes with a 5.5-inch full HD and packs a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. It also comes with a 13MP f/2.0 primary camera with a dual-LED flash for taking photos. Selfies are taken care of by the front-facing 5MP f/2.4 snapper. The 5X also sports a large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0, plus a dedicated dual-SIM tray — so none of that hybrid-SIM nonsense. The device will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with the EMUI 3.1 skin on top. As you can tell by the name, the honor 7 Enhanced is slightly improved version of the old (but gold) honor 7. It still packs the same 2.2GHz octa-core Kirin 935 processor paired with 3GB of RAM thrumming under a 5.2-inch full-HD display. It also brings over the honor 7’s 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash plus an 8MP front-facing camera with its own LED flash. What has changed then? It has more storage — double in fact at 32GB from the old 16GB found on the original honor 7. While it may seem like a simple change it is a significant one as one of the biggest qualms users had of this otherwise excellent device was the fact that it had a measly 16GB of onboard storage, which as we all know is not going to be enough especially with that 20MP snapper. This is also the first non-Nexus device to come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box that has been launched in Malaysia. If you want to get your hands on either of these devices, you can register your interest on Vmall.my from 26 January onwards. There is currently no information on the price of these devices, but we believe that the 5X should come in below RM1,000."

This is mighty helpful for those without credit and debit cards, being their only saving grace of purchasing anything on Google’s Android store. They’ll be throwing a little extra too to get you started on their Direct Billing system. To get users jump started on the service, Maxis has just added some extra initiatives. One of which is allowing all Maxis/Hotlink users to receive an RM 5 discount when they use Direct Billing for the first time. This will apply for anything and everything that’s on sale on the Play Store in our region. This promotion will run for a month from the 22nd of January till the 21st of February 2016. In conjunction with that RM 5 discount, Maxis/Hotlink will make it more worthwhile by allowing its Direct Billing users to be in the running to win a bill waiver worth RM 100 x 6 months or prepaid airtime credit – your entry is automatic when you make your first purchase on the Play Store with the Direct Billing option. Winners will be notified through SMS or call and there will be a maximum of 4000 customers that could possibly win the fee waiver prize. Maxis will select winners every 200th customer who purchases an item on the Play Store using Direct Billing. The waiver promo will run only from the 22nd till the 29th of January, so be sure to make your first-time purchase during the window. Those who used the Maxis Direct Billing before this announcement will still be entitled to the RM 5 discount since the promo has only begun. Here’s how to setup your Google account to be tied to your Maxis Billing: Remember when setting up the first time, you’ll have to make sure you’re connected to a Maxis/Hotlink data network (3G/4G) and you’re able to receive SMS. That’s the only way they can detect if you’re on their network in the first place. Any purchases/downloads that follow can utilise WiFi networks without hindering your direct billing. After doing so, you won’t have to repeat the steps as Maxis direct billing will now be your default payment method for anything on the Play Store. When purchasing it’ll look something like this: Keep in mind when using Maxis Direct Billing for Play Store purchases you’ll be required to pay an additional 6% GST for your purchases. For a full breakdown how Maxis’ Play Store Direct Billing works, check out our post  here .

Alexander Wong,Malaysia’s Fastest Mobile Network now gives you more throttled internet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/22/u-mobile-free-3gb-power-prepaid/,"Free Basic Internet,Free data,Free High Speed Internet,Internet,mobile internet,Power Prepaid,prepaid,U Mobile,U Mobile free 3GB Prepaid,U Mobile Prepaid","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2016-01-22,"U Mobile has just refreshed its  Power Prepaid , giving you even more free internet each month. When it was  first introduced , it offered the most free high-speed internet at 1GB as long as you top up a minimum of RM10 each month.  With the growing demand for internet on the go, Power Prepaid now comes with a whopping 3GB of Free Data. You should be impressed by now but wait until you see the full picture. While it looks like you’re getting a whopping 3GB with full speed internet on the surface, the reality is that nothing has changed. As a mobile internet user, you’ll depend mostly on high-speed internet which in this case, remains at 1GB for free. The remaining 2GB extra is for Basic Internet, which is throttled internet at 64kbps.  Previously, when you used up your free 1GB of data, you have a choice to top up more with its  UMI plans   or continue using with slower 64kbps speeds at no extra charges. U Mobile didn’t specify a limit for its throttled usage back then and now they have officially put a cap at 2GB. Assuming there was never a limit in the first place, this could be even seen as a downgrade.  Considering  other telcos  are offering 500MB of Basic Internet, U Mobile thought this would be a good idea to boast 4x more throttled internet than the rest. Upon hitting your basic internet limit, you will still lose connectivity until your next top up.  The rest of the Power Prepaid deal remains unchanged. The starter pack costs RM8.50 with RM5 credit preloaded and it comes with 10 days validity with 200MB of high-speed internet. The call rates are among the lowest at 5 sen/30 sec (10sen/minute), while SMS is charged at 8 sen each to all networks. As the fastest  Mobile Network in Malaysia , we genuinely expected better from U Mobile. 2GB of dial-up connectivity is nothing to be proud of.

The purported Mi 5 variants are as follows: It is also worth pointing out that Xiaomi’s launch is happening while  MWC 2016  is taking place at Barcelona. With Xiaomi  missing its sales target  for 2015, we expect the Chinese brand to expand to more markets with more competitive devices for 2016.

Cheryl Bates,Acer Predator 8 Review: Made for fun,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/26/acer-predator-8-review-malaysia/,,,2016-01-26,"One of the first of its kind, the Acer Predator 8 is essentially the one of the world firsts in terms of tablets built for gaming.  Sporting a unique shape, build and gaming-centric capabilities, we take a look at Acer’s gaming tablet. Design and build As far as the design and build go, the Predator 8 isn’t your bog standard tablet. Coming in at about 8 inches in size, the tablet has a rather unique shape; with four front-facing speakers (called the Predator Quadio) with one situated at each corner of the tablet. The tablet is surprisingly light considering how chunky it looks and how solid it feels; weighing in at a paltry 350g with the battery in. The sides are also shaped in a way that you have a decent place to grip without your hands getting in the way of said speakers if you want to play games in landscape mode. One minor gripe is the placement of its microUSB port at the top of the device as the charging cable will get in the way if you are playing games while charging. The rear of the device is home to a brushed metal plate with the Predator logo on it and is the only bit of the tablet that is made of solid metal. The rest of the Predator 8 is made of a combination of plastic and rubber that only simulates that metal finish but still looks good regardless. Due to its unique shape you probably won’t find many 3rd party cases for it, unfortunately, but  a few do exist . Also, we feel we need to mention that this is the first (compact) gaming tablet that has a form of haptic feedback called the Predator TacSense. There are two haptic motors, with one placed on each side.  So depending on the games you are playing it might vibrate to your actions, even the startup screen has the tablet buzzing to the logo. We do notice that the tactile feedback doesn’t apply to all games, though, only those which have been tweaked to have the feature in the first place."

The brilliant work of author/comic-writer/kid-trapped-in-an-adult’s-body Matthew Inman has been passed around the Internet more often than a keg at a frat house party, and for good reason. His comics are brilliant. He takes daily life situations, adds some magic, some ridiculousness, a  bear-o-dactyl  and boom, you’ll be on the floor clutching your sides laughing your head off, or trying not to puke from the graphic images. Either way, it’s a lot of fun. While most of his work was designed to have people cackling like witches on a broomstick, he does have some pretty hard hitting and emotional ones as well. One of his newer works about  Gene Roddenberry , for example, was as motivational as it was  bulu-roma  inducing. Not too long ago, The Oatmeal collaborated with Elan Lee and Shane Small to launch a  Kickstarter campaign  for their own imaginative card game: Exploding Kittens. It became one of the  most funded  projects on Kickstarter and quickly won the hearts of many but it suffered from the limitation of being a physical card game. Now, well…there’s an app for that. Exploding Kittens is a simple and straightforward game to be played with friends. The objective is simple — don’t explode. Each player starts with four cards and a defuse card with a universal draw deck in the middle. Players then take turns to play an action card followed by drawing another card from the deck in the centre. If a player draws a card with an exploding kitten, they will have to defuse the card or get blown up and ejected from the game. It continues until only one player is left. The app version of the game promises to be exactly the same. That means you get to have all the brilliant drawings of The Oatmeal, plus the simple and addictive mechanics of the game. What’s more, the app version will obviously have more attractive graphics for your actions, like this cat paw stealing your cards: If you’d like to download this app you can find it at the Apple  App Store . If you’d like to know more about this game+app, you can head on over to their  website  or watch the following gameplay videos to get a feel of how the game would flow. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"
Rory Lee,The OPPO F1 hits Malaysian shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/oppo-f1-launch-malaysia/,"F1 launch Malaysia,Oppo,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 launch,OPPO F1 launch Malaysia,OPPO F1 official,OPPO F1 official launch Malaysia,OPPO F1 official Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-21,"Earlier we saw the first device in  OPPO ‘s F range, the  F1 , make its official debut in Vietnam. Since Malaysia is a key market, we anticipated a local launch would follow soon after and sure enough, OPPO have brought this mid-range device to our shores. Despite the name, the F1 has nothing to do with the popular motorsport Formula 1. It does, however, look like the splitting image of the smartphones from OPPO’s R7 line, from white front panel right down to the square rear-mounted camera module and flash. The resemblance is uncanny. The device has a relatively small 5″ 720p HD display (1280×720 pixels) with a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor on the inside paired with 3GB of RAM for a pretty decent spec list. Internal storage is a tiny 16GB but that’s expandable via microSD for up to 128GB of extra storage. This smartphone also has support for dual-SIM (one Micro and one Nano) but since it’s a hybrid SIM set up, you will have to sacrifice one slot if you want to use a microSD card. This smartphone promises a “premium” photography experience at a reasonable price, so it gets a 13MP ISOCELL f/2.2 aperture rear-facing camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and a single LED flash. On the front, it packs an 8-megapixel f/2.0 snapper with a 1/4-inch sensor and built-in beautification features. Powering the device will be a modest 2,500 mAh battery which is a touch more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. It will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop with ColorOS 2.1 running on top. With those specs, this places the OPPO F1 right in the Xiaomi Redmi 3’s crosshairs. The F1 should have the edge in terms of performance though as it has 3GB of RAM versus the Redmi 3’s 2GB, but that extra performance does come with a higher price tag. The only question is how much lower will the Redmi 3 retail at? The OPPO F1 officially goes on sale online tomorrow, 22 January 2016, at midnight on the  OPPOStore  for RM1,198. The first 200 customers to purchase this device from the online store will receive a free OPPO Selfie Stick. If you’d prefer to check the device out before purchasing it, the OPPO F1 will be available in physical stores starting 25 January 2016."
Rory Lee,OPPO F1 hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/oppo-f1-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Oppo,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 first impressions,OPPO F1 Hands on,OPPO F1 Hands on Malaysia,OPPO F1 launch,OPPO F1 Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-21,"OPPO  plans to take over the midrange smartphone market one selfie at a time with their latest smartphone the  F1 . OPPO are so committed to the selfie abilities of this smartphone that they’ve even hired “Selfie Ambassador” Nora Danish to demonstrate just how powerful this device is at taking selfies. 
 Let’s start with the build. If you’ve been following our coverage of the OPPO F1, I’m sure you would have noticed how similar this device is with the OPPO R7 series. It so happened we had an OPPO R7s on hand so we placed the two devices side by side. Quickly, which device is which? Honestly, besides the size and the back firing speaker grille, these two devices are almost exactly the same from the back. The camera module, the flash, the two toned rear panels (because of the different materials), the feel and the rounded edges were all exactly the same. It was unreal. Since it was exactly the same, it also had the same feel in the hand as the R7s — albeit the smaller footprint — so that part didn’t feel so good. Then again, for a midrange device, you can’t really complain. Around the front, that’s a different story. The front bears enough differences to identify which is which. Opting for capacitive buttons instead of the on-screen ones on the R7s, the F1 lets you use its display to its maximum potential. Not that it had a very impressive display, but we’ll get into that later. What I did like was the rounded front edges. With the 2.5D glass set to curve slightly more and slightly later, the glass and the metal blended seamlessly into each other giving the device a nice rounded edge. It was almost iPhone 6s Plus like, so props to OPPO for acheiving the something like that on a midrange device. Beyond that, the device felt generally nice in the hand — though I would have liked it a little more if it had a slight curve, but that’s up to the individual. The OPPO F1 is powered by a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) IPS panel which isn’t all that impressive. The device comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop with OPPO’s ColorOS 2.1 running on top. The device draws juice from a 2,500 mAh battery and also has support for dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) although since it’s a hybrid set up you will have to sacrifice a microSD slot for the second SIM. Performance was pretty decent. It didn’t lag when switching between applications (though there weren’t many applications pre-installed to begin with) and it handled what little multitasking I threw at it. I’m not particularly a fan of the ColorOS Android skin, but some of you may like it so that’s ultimately down to personal preference. The display was okay-ish and you probably wouldn’t notice the 720p-ness unless you’re coming from a higher screen resolution. Now we get to the part everyone has been waiting for — the camera. It packs a 13-megapixel ISOCELL rear shooter with Phase Detection AF and a large f/2.2 aperture that was pretty good in the venue’s sketchy lighting. It took decent shots, but since we could only view it on a 720p screen, we won’t make any claims just yet. What everyone’s curious about is the 8MP front-facing snapper. When you think of a “selfie phone”, you’d think of something like the  ASUS ZenFone Selfie  which sports a massive 13MP front facing selfie shooter with autofocus and dual LED flash for RM1,049. Next to those beastly specs, the OPPO F1 that costs RM1,198 simply pales in comparison. It doesn’t even have a front facing flash — instead it relies on a “screen flash”, which basically turns your screen white and bright, to illuminate dark subjects. Probably best used in dark conditions, the screen flash did absolutely nothing in the launch venue’s dodgy lighting, but again we will have to fully test this out before we make any judgements. When you think about this phone, you can’t go at it purely from a specs perspective. If you were to do that, perhaps the ZenFone Selfie is the better device with it’s 5.5″ full HD display, but look at it. It’s chunky, it’s fat and it is very plasticky. The OPPO F1 on the other hand, is a slim thing with a great build and a premium feel. It’s rounded metal rails and smooth metallic back are awesome to run your hand across. It’s the phone for the fashionista, for someone who cares more about style and looks than pure hardware specs. Let me put it this way, could you see Nora Danish using a ZenFone Selfie? Exactly."

Or 5e. Whatever the name though, this Apple smartphone is said to have a smaller 4-inch display and should be unveiled in March. Now a video has surfaced, claiming to be the “First real 4-inch iPhone 2016″ video leak, the short 40-second clip — if true — does give at least some information on Apple’s purported next product. Yeah, it looks exactly like an iPhone 6/6s. In fact, it looks so much like an iPhone 6/6s that many are calling this video a fake and that the reason it looks small-ish is because the guy manning the camera has large hands. Honestly, it does look kind of sketchy and as 9to5Mac pointed out, the speaker grille ratios were pretty similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone so that does add some credence to the “big-hands” justification. It is said that MIC Gadget has a reasonable history in obtaining devices for a hands-on ahead of time so maybe there is some truth to all of this. But, there is no way of identifying if this is actually the new iPhone 6C or if it is just a regular iPhone 6. There’s tape over many of the important identifier bits, there is no comparison with the iPhone 6/6s, and there is really nothing in the room that can tell us anything about the scale of this device. Considering how good  iPhone clones  have gotten, it honestly wouldn’t be too surprising if the phone in the video is actually a clone made to look like it could be the iPhone 6c. There have been many fakes in the past, some running an iOS skinned version of Android, some just flat out running Android, but it seems that there are plenty of people who can’t tell the difference: Clearly many are willing to believe anything people tell them, so perhaps this guy is banking on the gullibility of society? Who knows. What we do know is that you shouldn’t believe everything someone tells you. So, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt. What do you think of this device and its “hands-on” video? Does it look legit? Would you buy one? Why did they make it look exactly the same as the iPhone 6/6s instead of going down the iPhone 5c route? Let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

Huawei has apparently gone to great lengths to put ownership on a name that we’d never expect. This comes after news that Chinese tech conglomerate will be entering the PC market in the near future. Supposedly, making a hybrid device that’ll rival the Microsoft’s Surface and other PC-makers’ 2-in-1s. PCs are making a comeback, no not those big towers but ultrabooks and convertibles. But what hopes does Huawei have on entering the market that has been established for so long? And what operating system will they settle for? Earlier rumours detailed that it might be a dual-boot system that’ll have both Windows and Android but no one has offered anything like that out of the box. We’re not entirely convinced that will happen but it’s plausible that it’ll be offered in two OS options like how Xiaomi has just done with the Mi Pad 2. Entering a new market is an ambitious decision and the branching out from networking and telecommunications devices, something that Xiaomi did really early on. They’ve made air purifiers, TVs, routers, and etc. Huawei focuses on the telco side of things, providing network solutions and the works. Of course, to most of the world they’re known for the smartphones they put out but in those markets mentioned earlier, they’re really big too. We’re going to see more Mate(s) than we have ever before. If this trademark is anything to go by and April will be the month to watch out for when Huawei’s factories will apparently start churning out these computers. The market is already so saturated and unless Huawei makes something that changes it all, they might fail in getting the attention of customers who’d rather trust established brands. Not all times have trademarked terms came to something so it could just mean Huawei is setting aside a just-in-case if they were to release a laptop of some sort. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

The team in Mountain View assures that the vulnerability isn’t all that serious after all. Malware attacks have been a monthly problem towards the back-end of last year but, at least, this time, most Android users won’t have much to worry about. And for the rest, a patch has been issued. When announced that 66% of Android devices out there could easily be bugged, there was a real frenzy. But no one gave Google a chance to explain its side of things. Google highlights that any device that runs Android 5.0 or later is protected by an added security layer dubbed Android SELinux policy. On the other hand, the older smartphones out there which run Android 4.4, the particular Linux kernel 3.8 code wasn’t used at the time. Ahh, we can hear a worldwide sigh of relief from our office. Either way, Google wants to make sure that there are no oversights and are releasing a patch as we speak. You can expect this OTA on your devices very soon. The original discovery found that “CVE-2016-0728” allowed third-party apps to access data in the OS’ keyring and encrypt it afterwards so it can’t be accessed by the user. Once exploited, the malicious apps would be allowed to reign terror outside the controlled environment of the sandbox and gain control of the operating system’s root functions.

Weeks after being announced at CES 2016, Razer’s first “smartwatch” is now available on our shores. The manufacturer has not had a lot of luck in the wearable segment, with their first, the Razer Nabu X falling short of expectations. But will, this time, be any different? The device would suit any rough and tough individual that needs something that can handle a few knocks here and there. Using a digital Chronograph watch face, the Nabu wearable has a 5 ATM water resistance rating and will be durable enough to withstand drops from 5 metres. It uses a regular backlit display that you can find on other digital watches and has the following (typical) features an alarm, stopwatch, world time. Yet, they stay updated by syncing through Bluetooth when paired with your phone – ensuring your watch is always accurate. Its second OLED screen is where things get “smarter” and when you raise your wrist into view, it’ll turn on automatically. On that screen, you’ll be able to see phone notifications on a single-line. As you would on those left to right scrolling text. Since it’s a fitness watch, you’ll also have activity data on the same secondary display. Although Razer wants to go the fitness route, they left out an optical heart-rate monitor which would’ve added a nice touch. When considering power sources, the two displays rely on different battery sources: The smartwatch will be compatible with  Android  and  iOS  devices. Two version will be available on Razer’s online store. The Razer Nabu Watch will go for RM 749 while the fancier looking Razer Nabu Watch Forged Edition will cost RM 999. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

After releasing five different versions in Malaysia and spinning-off too many devices under the ZenFone name to count. Their flagship smartphone has been on the market for a year already and these benchmarks imply that we’re going to see a new generation of ZenFones pretty soon. Labelled ASUS Z010DD and Z012D, it seems like two versions with different specs went through GFXBench recently. Surprisingly, both seem to be carrying Qualcomm chipsets – indicating that the manufacturer may ditch Intel SoCs that they have dearly utilised in the past. In the past, ASUS used the model numbers Z008 and Z00AD on their ZenFone 2s and the current numbers shown aren’t that far off to assume they represent their upcoming smartphones. Out of the two model numbers, the one that appears to have better specs is the Z012D. The device in question is listed with a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display and a Hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor (clocked to 1.7GHz). Based on the benchmark, it’ll have Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For the lower-spec Z010DD, it also runs Android Marshmallow but only has an HD (1280 x 720) screen that oddly is bigger at 5.9-inches. It’ll run an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset clocked at 1.5GHz mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Surprisingly, the listing for Z010DD has camera-specifications. There will be a 12-megapixel shooter on the rear and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front. ASUS is likely to pursue more Qualcomm chipsets due to their battery-life woes. This switch might help and users should welcome this news with open arms. We won’t know for sure where these two devices will sit in ASUS’ lineup and there’s a possibility that both of these are the lower end models not a part of the ZenFone 3 series. Only one thing will be for sure, they’ll release a dozen phones with the same name. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"

First you guys have to put up with apps – even mainstream ones – that aren’t updated since God knows when then you have that small ecosystem of the Windows Store. Now on top of all that, it seems like that Windows 10 Mobile release for older phones isn’t coming this month. This is based on a twitter exchange between a user and a French telco, Bouygues Telecom. In the conversation, twitter user NotCassim asks if Windows 10 Mobile will be rolling out to old Lumias. The thread continues by another user stepping in and saying that another rep from the same telco told him it will be by “late February”. Microsoft has been rather mum on the subject but we’re sure they’re trying to strategise global recalls of the older-generation Surface Pros that have  faulty charging bricks  that supposedly catch fire in some instances. Microsoft already delayed this release once before, as earlier reports claimed that they’ll be releasing the big software update in mid-January. That has passed without a peep. You can expect Redmond to give a crap about the existing Lumias in the market, cause they’re sure to outnumber any sales of the current-generation Lumia 950 and 950 XLs that just hit our shores not too long ago.

Rory Lee,Here’s why we think the “Indonesian Iron Man” is fake,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/heres-why-we-think-the-indonesian-iron-man-is-fake/,,,2016-01-20,"By now, I’m sure most of you have seen a video making its rounds on social media, and even  9gag , about a guy with a robotic arm that he built in a garage to help him overcome the limitations of his paralysed left hand. Sounds amazing right? Yeah, we think this sounds too good to be true. Here’s why. // <![CDATA[
(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
// ]]&gt; I Wayan Sutawan, affectionately referred to as Tawan, suffered a minor stroke six months ago which paralysed his left arm. Because he’s a mechanic of sorts, one can imagine that having a paralysed left hand can be quite a cumbersome thing. So, rather than sit around and whine about it, Tawan set to work and in two months created a robotic arm out of spare parts he had around his workshop. He can control the robot arm via a headband around his forehead that picks up his brain signals and allows him to control the arm movement accordingly. Based on the video, not only can he lift objects and move his arm around, he can also pick up and hold on to rather delicate objects. So why do we think this miraculous feat has more in common with the Boy Who Cried Wolf than it does with Iron Man? That means the body part — the muscles, the nerve cells, the tendons and ligaments — are perfectly functional, there is just nothing telling them to move. So, if it’s the brain that can’t issue the command, how then can his “brainwave detector” — that looks like a bunch of LEDs strapped around his head with duct tape — detect the brainwaves issued by a part of the brain that no longer functions? Plus, even if that contraption around his head  could  pick up the brainwaves from dead/damaged braincells that can no longer issue commands via a human’s regular nervous system, where on earth did he store the processor needed to make sense of those brainwaves (or even identify the correct ones) and translate them into mechanical motor functions? How did he develop such sophisticated programming? What kind of supercomputing power is being used to digest all that data? While the motors and the hydraulics for the upper segments of the arm could possibly pass off as motors to facilitate movement, the glove that controls Tawan’s finer finger movements don’t have any actuators at all. So how could this contraption allow him to make the finger movements necessary to pick up and grip the solder in the video? Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the brain aren’t exactly new. Take a look at this  article  by The Guardian on a DARPA-funded research project for robotic arms that can feel. What the scientists at Johns Hopkins university Applied Physics Laboratory did was have the electrodes from the prosthetic hand inserted into his sensory and motor cortexes so that he could not only control the hand with thought, he could also feel and sense when his “fingers” were touched. Once again, this is proof that in order for your brain to control a prosthetic arm, the necessary cortexes would have to be able to send a signal and function properly first. Another thing to note is that if a project led by the brilliant scientists of Johns Hopkins needed funding from a US military agency like DARPA to succeed, how on earth did Tawan manage to build one himself out of spare parts? What is more likely is that the man simply has a weak arm that needs some motorised help to actually function properly. In fact, if you pay close attention to his left arm when he is inserting it into his mechanical contraption, you can see his wrist flick upwards before it enters the sleeve. Everything about this story seems too sketchy to be true. The fact that a simple mechanic from a rural town could just one day up and build something so advanced from spare parts should have raised at least a few flags. Add “brainwave-controlled” to that description and you would have a beautiful script to a story designed for the big screen. You would have Iron Man actually. And Tony Stark doesn’t exist — no matter how hard Elon Musk tries. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

We rely on them for nearly everything under the Sun when on the Internet. They’re some we hate – Internet Explorer – and some we love (Google Chrome).  What makes the difference? Mainly the load times between sessions and thankfully, Google has been busy baking their new compression algorithm, Brotli since September of last year.  What in the world is this Brotli? That’s their new formula that’ll make Chrome 26% faster and save more data while browsing on 3G/4G LTE. Taking over existing Zopfli, the yet to be released algorithm is now fresh out the oven and is expected to roll out in an update very soon.  It’s a lot of jargon to comprehend how Brotli’s new data format makes a difference; to simplify the minimising, the compression size makes it easier for your devices to utilise space and speed up load times of pages.  This will take place across all platforms from mobile to PCs, so that means using it while connected to your cellular data will be less strenuous on battery life and data limits. Mass adoption has already begun with Mozilla also said to be using Brotli in the future. While most of the times Chrome is bundled into Android’s platform, those who love who have limited data caps usually rely on  Opera Mini . The team at Opera somehow managed to squeeze the living daylights out of pages with their high and extreme data saving modes that has saved many users from hitting their throttled speeds. It’ll be interesting how Chrome’s new compression matches up. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Rory Lee,We’ve broken the AppLock -Fingerprint- “encryption” and it wasn’t even that difficult,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/21/weve-broken-the-applock-fingerprint-encryption-and-it-wasnt-even-that-difficult/,"AppLock,AppLock Fingerprint,Fingerprint decrypted,Fingerprint encryption","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Others",2016-01-21,"We’ve touched on how good the Nexus 6P’s fingerprint sensor is in the past with its quick unlock speed and high accuracy despite only needing six taps to register your finger. You can also use it to authenticate Google Play as well as Android Pay purchases, but we’ve always hoped it could do more especially since Google baked fingerprint support into Android 6.0 Marshmallow itself. Thanks to the open API though, now you can use your fingerprint to lock specific apps in your phone — but there’s a catch. App locking is no new concept. It simply allows you to lock specific applications, requiring either a password or pin to access that particular app. Let’s say, your friends are the nosy bunch and the moment they get their hands on your device, they like to head into the gallery to look at all your embarrassing failed selfie attempts. Thanks to an app locker, you can stop that by protecting access to that application with an app locker. Some devices even have that natively in their Android skin, while others even allow you to lock entire folders of applications. Entering a password is  so  last century and developer SurpriseToYou have come up with AppLock -Fingerprint-, an app that lets you (if you’re on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) lock individual applications in your phone with your fingerprint. Although we must note the incredibly sketchy developer name. When I’m using a security app, I don’t really want it to surprise me. To use it, the app requires you to grant it three different levels of access — Apps with usage access, Draw over other apps, and Activate device administrator. Once in, it’s a simple task of choosing which application you want locked by flicking the toggle next to that specific app. Once you launch the app that you’ve locked, the AppLock -Fingerprint- overlay will draw over the app and ask for your fingerprint. But, true to the developer’s name, here’s the surprise — when that overlay pops up and “locks” your app, should you receive a banner notification from WhatsApp, the overlay drops and you have access to said “locked” app without ever inputting your fingerprint. What kind of security is this?! While the fact that this app runs on ads without a way to disable it is a little annoying, I think the far more pressing issue is the fact that you can break the “encryption” with a single banner notification. If, however, that doesn’t bother you and you’re interested in this app, you can get it from the PlayStore. Just, erm I don’t know, turn off your banner notifications in the mean time?

When abused, it can cause adverse effects. That’s what Communication and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Dr. Salleh Said Keruak believes as the government is mulling for tougher enforcements for online users. According to the minister, social media is often abused for defaming and to incite hatred against leaders and the institutions of government. To put an end to these issues, the government is pushing to amend the MCMC Act in March, which will give it more powers to act on such abusers. The police will work closely with the MCMC in their investigations. To speed up the process, a dedicated deputy public prosecutor has been appointed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers to handle social media cases.   The new amendment could also allow more websites to be blocked, especially those that are seen to be threatening the peace and violating the Sedition Act. One such site is Sarawak Report, which he says has been spreading lies against the government and it creates confusion among the people. The minister has also added that he hopes Malaysians won’t view this in a negative light as it was necessary to safeguard the public’s interest. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such warning. In the middle of last year, MCMC had  issued a notice  advising Malaysians against spreading lies on 1MDB.  Once the amendment is passed in 2 months time, you better think twice before making slanderous statements on your Facebook, Twitter and other social channels. That one rant could win you a “Go to Jail” card.  There are a lot of nasty things being posted on social media these days but there’s a difference between offensive and defamatory. Will the police and MCMC be able to tell the difference between the two? In the UK, there had been several cases of  users being jailed  for being offensive.  What do you think of this MCMC Act amendment? Will it make Malaysians more responsible online or will it suppress our freedom of speech? [  SOURCE   2 ,  IMAGE CREDIT  ]"

A few days ago, we saw the new Galaxy A trio  hit SIRIM . Now, we’ve just received an email indicating that Samsung will be launching these new devices — the  Galaxy A3 ,  Galaxy A5  and  Galaxy A7  — next week. Samsung Malaysia has set the official unveiling of the Galaxy A line for 28 January 2016  which is next Thursday. The Galaxy A series will share the Galaxy S6’s good looks with its glass front and back panels held together by a metal frame. The edges are rounded for a better grip and feel in the hand. The devices also get a bump, across the line, up to a 13-megapixel f/1,9 aperture rear shooter and a front-facing 5MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates the Galaxy A3’s camera from the other two bigger devices is the lack of OIS though we suspect people who are going for a budget device won’t mind this too much. The best part? All three devices have a Pink Gold colour option — which we hope they will bring to Malaysia as well. Sitting at the top of the Galaxy A’s pecking order is the largest of the trio with a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED display. On the inside, the devices will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Thankfully the internal storage is expandable via microSD to up to 128GB of extra internal storage. The Galaxy A7 also gets a large 3,300 mAh battery. Next up we have the Galaxy A5 which is slightly smaller at 5.2″ but with the same full-HD (1920×1080) Super AMOLED display. Powering the device will be a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. However, it gets a smaller 2,900 mAh battery for juice. Rounding out the trio is the smallest sibling, the Galaxy A3. Sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720) Super AMOLED display with a quad-core 1.5GHz processor running on the inside. It also packs 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. The device will be drawing power from a 2,300 mAh battery. The trio of devices will not launch with Android 6.0 Marshmallow though, as they’re set to come with Android 5.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box. That said, we do expect them to get Marshmallow within a reasonable amount of time. The two higher end devices — the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 — also sport a fingerprint scanner. Those are mighty specs for a budget device, but only if these devices are actually priced like a budget device. Based on the Singaporean pricing of the Galaxy A line, that doesn’t really look to be the case. In Singapore, the Galaxy A3 is going for SGD398 (around RM1,211),  while the Galaxy A5 costs SGD598 (around RM1,820) and the biggest Galaxy A7 will set you back SGD698 (around RM2,125). A pretty hefty price tag then. Then again, Singapore’s prices have generally been much higher than in Malaysia. If we’re going off last year’s Malaysian pricing, the Galaxy A3 went for RM899, Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199 and the Galaxy A7 had an RM1,499 price tag. But, keep in mind that these prices were before GST. Would you consider these devices at those price ranges? Let us know in the comments section below."

We’re all dying to know the specs of  Samsung ’s latest flagship. Most of them have one thing in common, they all say that it’ll be either an  Exynos 8890  or  Snapdragon 820  processor under their hoods. Benchmark experts AnTuTu have reaffirmed that they’ll indeed be an Exynos 8890 in at least one variant of the  Galaxy S7  as well as its accompanying specs. In a post on Weibo, the people behind the app have let the cat out of the bag. They posted that the SM-G930F – corresponding to a the non-edge version of the Galaxy S7 – will have 4GB of RAM and a rather decent 64GB of internal storage. Imagine having that much storage plus a potential (rumoured) microSD card slot? Malaysians are gonna lap this up. Other internals were also detailed, like a 5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 resolution AMOLED display and a 12-megapixel rear lens. Despite there being fewer pixels on the main camera, it’s easily suggested that they’ll be using larger sensors as detailed during their  BRITECELL  technology showcase. On the front, it looks like a 5-megapixel sensor, possibly with the same BRITECELL tech. You won’t have to wait that long to hear more stuff on the new Samsung flagships, fortunately, MWC 2016 is happening in a month and there’s bound to be more leaks till then. In spite of AuTuTu being a benchmarking app, the makers have yet to publish “official” scores of the device. They claimed that it’s an early prototype and the results won’t do the device justice. At least, they said they might do it later, once the phone’s performance is more stable. For a look at what else the new Samsung smartphones might come with, check out this post  here .

With the apparent demand for smartphones in a pink hue, now consumers have an extra device to choose from! This is great news for those who want a Pink Gold Galaxy Note5 but don’t want to have to purchase one via  Maxis ‘  Zerolution  plan. Through the Zerolution plan, users can pick up the device with no upfront payments and no interest charges on your monthly installments from 22 January onwards. If you were to opt for this plan, you will have to pay an RM93/month installment for the device for 24 months but you’ll need to top up an extra RM30/month for the Zerolution Upgrade option. Do note that this does not include your postpaid plan subscription. For more information on this plan, you can head on over  here . As Samsung is bringing this phone in themselves, those who don’t want to pay on a monthly basis can simply head down to a Samsung dealer and pick one up yourself today. Yup, this device is available starting today, 21 January 2016, onwards while stocks last at the same recommended retail price of RM2,699 inclusive of GST. According to Samsung, this “special edition” smartphone is perfectly designed for the ladies and they feel that it will “resonate with women of all ages”. What, men can’t buy pink phones too?"

But when you have iMacs, Dell’s XPS AIO and the Lenovo IdeaCentre line making their own case in homes and offices around the world, where does it fit? What is it good for? Looking at the competition, the Pavilion AIO is the most affordable and it looks attractive for the price. Add touchscreen compatibility into the mix with those Windows Live Tiles and you get one of the most natural interactions you could with a screen of that size – excluding that of those in Sci-Fi movies. Loosely resembling Apple’s own all-in-one, HP hopes to capture the people out there that want the same(ish) looks but don’t have the absurdity of dropping a lot more money for it."

The suit comes from an influential NGO that cares for consumer interests in Netherlands, Consumentenbond aka Dutch Consumers’ Association. The group claims that Samsung has a horrible software update policy for their Android-based smartphones. They want the South Korean giant to start being more transparent in providing a relative timeline of how long these devices will be supported. Issues pertaining to Stagefright and other critical vulnerabilities were highlighted in their release. Talking about the Stagefright problem  before , Samsung did say that they were going to fight software manipulation by pledging to monthly security updates over-the-air (OTA). For a further explanation of what Stagefright is, head on over  here . Consumentenbond attempts of out-of-court discussions with Samsung didn’t achieve a “desired result”. Thus, the association thinks that they should be held viable and will face off with the “undisputed market leader in Android phones” in the chambers of law. A suit comes into picture after the association ran an “Update!” campaign to promote more consistent software updates from Android OEMs. Their claims aren’t baseless either, as they’ve found that an estimated 82% of Samsung smartphones in Netherlands have not received the latest version of Android in the two years after being introduced. Users have nothing to lose from this case and it’s no question that a revamp to Samsung’s upgrade policy will be greatly appreciated on all consumer fronts. In the consideration of security and privacy breaches, at least if done correctly, Samsung could tackle them swiftly by providing (more) regular updates. If the Dutch Consumers’ Association manages to put up a good fight, it could pose Samsung to rethink releasing too many devices in a year and their TouchWiz development team are probably gonna get a lot more work on their hands – plus long-term support could make their phones pricier too. These groups are not to be taken for granted and we’re assuming the EU (European Union) should take notice and demand the same things if things favour Consumentenbond in Dutch courts.

Rory Lee,The honor 5X and honor 7 Enhanced are coming to Malaysia next week,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/19/the-honor-5x-and-honor-7-enhanced-are-coming-to-malaysia-next-week/,"Android,android 6.0 marshmallow,Android M,Honor,Honor 5X,honor 5X launch Malaysia,honor 5X Malaysia,Honor 7,honor 7 Enhanced,honor 7 Enhanced launch Malaysia,honor 7 enhanced malaysia,huawei,smart phone,smartphone","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-19,"More good news for the local midrange phone market as honor are planning to “unleash” two of their much-awaited midrange smartphones, the  honor 5X  and honor 7 Enhanced in Malaysia next week! We just received the invite in our mail stating that honor are planning to launch both devices at the same time on January 26, next Tuesday. Suffice to say we will be bringing you live updates from the ground on that very day. Of the two devices launched, the honor 5X is definitely the more interesting one. The 5X is honor’s answer to the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 , with it’s full metal build as well as rear mounted fingerprint scanner. The 5.5″ device will sport a full HD screen plus a Snapdragon 616 octa-core processor — a departure from their home-grown Kirin SoCs. Nevertheless, the Snapdragon 616 will be paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. What it does have over the Redmi Note 3 is a dedicated microSD card slot which allows you to expand that small internal memory. Because of the fact that honor ditched the hybrid SIM set up, users can use two SIM cards and the microSD storage simultaneously. It will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box with their EMUI 3.1 skin running over it. For camera optics, the device will sport a 13MP f/2.0 primary shooter with dual-LED flash to help out in low light conditions, as well as a 5-megapixel f/2.4 front shooter. The phone will draw power from a fairly large 3,000 mAh battery that has support for Quick Charge 3.0. The honor 5X is going for RMB1,099 in China (around RM730) which is only a touch higher than the Redmi Note 3’s 16GB version and the same price as the 32GB version. In Malaysia you can get an imported Redmi Note 3 ( via DirectD ) for under RM1,000, so the question is: How low will honor go? The honor 7 Enhanced isn’t all that different than the already good un-enhanced version which we  liked  a lot. The only enhancement is the fact that this device will now come with 32GB of internal storage and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. While the bump in storage from 16GB might not be that big of a deal to some, many felt that one of the biggest problems with the honor 7 was the lack of storage space. Now with double that, this device just got a whole lot better. Besides that, this will be the first non-nexus smartphone in Malaysia to be officially sold with Android M out-of-the-box. So, you get to have all those awesome Marshmallow features to yourself. The device features a 5.2″ full HD display on the front with an octa-core Kirin 935 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with 3GB of RAM. Camera-wise it has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX230 camera sensor with PDAF and a dual-LED flash. The front camera is an 8MP unit with its own front-facing flash to help with those low-light selfies. In China, the honor 7 Enhanced is going for RMB 1,999 (around RM1330) — the same price as the honor 7, with the original getting a bump down to RMB1,799 (around RM1,200) — which is quite the steal. In Malaysia, the honor 7 is priced at RM1,399 so we expect the new Enhanced version match the original’s price."
Rory Lee,Did you damage your device? Soon it’ll bleed to let you know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/did-you-damage-your-device-soon-itll-bleed-to-let-you-know/,"bleed,car bleeding,casing bleed,color changing polymer,colour changing polymer,early damage detection,how to see tiny cracks,polymer coating","Cool stuff,Others",2016-01-20,"Sometimes, a tiny crack is all it takes to cause severe damage to an object. It’s these tiny cracks that we don’t see because they’re often impossible to spot in, for example, your car’s windscreen. However, these cracks become the first weaknesses in any object and could potentially lead to something really bad somewhere down the road. Well, a University of Illinois research has led to a  polymer  coating that could be an important early damage warning system, making it easier to find cracks or damage in particular objects by making them bleed. This polymer coating consists of tiny micro beads that crack open, causing a chemical reaction that will visibly highlight any damage with colour. These beads are pH sensitive so any damage will cause a colour change — from yellow to red — without the need for additional chemicals. The bigger the crack or scratch, the deeper the object will bleed as more capsules are affected. What’s good about this coating is that it works on multiple kinds of polymers that can coat metals, other polymers and even glass. Plus, they’re apparently not too expensive either, but no specific quote of a price was given. What’s more, the coating shows no sign of degradation — meaning the microcapsules will stay intact until actual cracks or damage happens. The application possibilities of this technology are endless. Since only 5% of a polymer needs to be microcapsules to have a strong damage indication ability, you can apply it to a myriad of things. While this can prove useful to big projects like rocket launches into space as well as deep sea exploration, there are also plenty of everyday products that can benefit. Off the top of my head would be your action cam/smartphone’s waterproof casing. Those things are transparent so it’s incredible difficult to find small cracks in their seal, but all it takes is a little nick to let the water in and damage your precious device. Planes and vehicles stand to benefit from this polymer too, as important components in these machines can be coated to allow for early damage detection which could potentially save lives. It’s kind of nice to think that your car could bleed for you before you have to bleed yourself. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"
Rory Lee,5 reasons you should ditch the Facebook app,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/20/5-reasons-you-should-to-ditch-the-facebook-app/,,,2016-01-20,"“There’s an app for that.” A popular saying when it comes to these little devices we carry around all day called smartphones. It’s amazing what our devices can do with a dedicated app, especially when it comes to social media applications. If you’ve ever used the  Instagram  app versus visiting it on the browser, you will know what I mean. Unfortunately, some applications are really heavy and take up a lot of resources, slowing down slower phones. One of which is the  Facebook  application. It takes up a whopping amount of space in your internal storage versus something like Instagram that only uses a fraction of the amount, but because this is the only and most complete application for browsing Facebook, we begrudgingly use it. Common perception would be that the mobile browser version is always a whole lot worse than the app, but according to Android Central, that isn’t the case. Russell Holly wrote an  article  about how he uninstalled Facebook on his Android device and it turned out to be a better experience than he expected. That got us thinking, is the Facebook app really worth it? Well, for what we believe is the majority of FB users, we doubt it. Here are the five reasons we think  Android  users should ditch the Facebook application. If you’re on it for a moderate amount of time a day, you will notice that it becomes one of the biggest battery drainers on your phone. Plus, it is a performance hog too, something Russell also notes, so it will significantly slow down the performance of lower-end devices. If you’ve ever installed the Facebook app, I’m sure you’d notice the ridiculous amount of permissions they “require” to function properly. It wants access to so much of my information that I’m pretty sure the Zuck knows me better than my mom does."

After  reports  of child labourers used in their acquisition of cobalt minerals for lithium batteries, it seems that Redmond will be issuing a global voluntary replacement/recall for Surface Pro charging bricks and cables. The tech giant is claimed to be making a statement this Friday (22nd January) to announce which units of the Surface Pro, Surface Pro 2 and Surface Pro 3 tablets are to be affected. But based on the Channelnomics Europe report, it’ll be the three models mentioned above that were sold in Europe before the 15th of July, 2015. Corresponding via e-mail with ZDNet, the Microsoft representative had this to say: While using the Surface Pro 4, we never noticed any issues of this kind and our colleague hasn’t faced any either while using the Surface Pro 3. Microsoft wasn’t clear on which models but it seems that the Surface Pro 4 won’t be involved if Channelnomics Europe’s report was indeed true – since the timeline doesn’t match-up with the latest Surface Pro only hitting markets in Q4 of 2015. For those in the States, it seems the recall will be directed at the same three generation of Surface Pros but will be for those sold before March of 2015 – clarification from Microsoft’s representative. This twisted fate for the older top of the line Surface tablets has just added another pile of worry on the manufacturer’s lap. Adding to the  software issues  that have plagued the current-generation Surface Pro 4. They’ve got their work cut out for them. In the meantime, be sure not to put any stress on the power cables by wrapping them around the brick or tightly winding them – we know it’s messy but you don’t want a fire on your hands. The spokesperson also mentions that this voluntary recall will be global, so be sure to look out for Microsoft Malaysia’s official statement (if any) which we will cover in the future.

Though now, any Maxis/Hotlink customer can easily purchase apps, in-app purchases, Google Movies, E-books and newsstand content through Maxis direct billing – credit/debit card not necessary. Users on the green-loving telco can now pay for any Play Store purchase through their monthly billings. Prepaid lines aren’t left out either with just two prerequisites you’ll need to fulfill. Maxis hopes that through the direct billing it’ll open doors to those with no credit/debit cards to now make purchases on the Play Store. We’re seeing this trend from other organisations; Digi being another telco that started this  initiative  in September last year. The limitations of these plastic cards are something that companies are starting to realise with WhatsApp also doing away with the need to pay for their service because of not many people having a credit/debit card. For postpaid, direct billing will be available to all customers except those using Corporate lines. Any purchases will be billed in the next bill cycle. On the other hand, prepaid users will need to make sure they are subscribed (at least) to a Monthly Data Plan of 1GB to be eligible – obviously, they’ll also have to ensure they have sufficient prepaid airtime balance as the billing is instant. These are the steps to set it up: Remember when setting up the first time, you’ll have to make sure you’re connected to a Maxis/Hotlink data network (3G/4G) and you’re able to receive SMS. That’s the only way they can detect if you’re on their network in the first place. Any purchases/downloads that follow can utilise WiFi networks without hindering your direct billing. After doing so, you won’t have to repeat the steps as Maxis direct billing will now be your default payment method for anything on the Play Store. When purchasing it’ll look something like this: It was a nice touch that they added the SMS notification for any purchase that you’ve made. There will also be an added e-mail from Google and a purchase history in Google Wallet for extra documentation. Carefully reminding you of all the money that’ll be flying away. It won’t be that bad, Maxis sets a cap of RM 200/month by default for postpaid users, ensuring that you don’t spend too much on the Play Store. In the scenario that you want to increase your limit, you can do so by contacting their customer service for help. Only principal line holders can readjust purchase limits – some useful info for users on supplementary lines. Interestingly, when using Maxis direct billing for Google Play Store purchases, you’ll be charged an additional 6% GST – added to the amount shown on the Google Play Store. But we’re not sure how this will work for users on prepaid as GST is supposed to be rebated back to you if you’re a Malaysian – you can read about it all  here . Since you’ll have to pay GST while using Maxis direct billing, it makes more sense for users with credit/debit cards to use the regular card billing method, since you won’t be hit with the tax. Refunds are the typical as per Play Store policy, giving you a window of two hours to request a refund. You’ll be able to do that by going back to the purchased app and select “Refund”. If you missed the two-hour period, it’ll change to reflect “Uninstall” instead. Any late request will have to be directed to app developers, and it’ll be up to them to decide if your excuse is valid. Users will be notified via SMS if they’ve successfully got a refund. [  SOURCE  ]"

Well, Sony’s latest projector doesn’t just do that but watching the video of its real-life applications will get your mouth to drop. Ours did. Sony shows off how you can use it as a clock, a nightlight, a screen and even a weather display. It appears as a sexy textured set top box in white – something straight out designer’s dream and comes from the Japanese manufacturer’s Life Space UX range of home electronics. Tiny in stature, this nifty projector can beam any image to surfaces around your home within short distances. Portability makes this projector the best little thing to bring around if you want to beam stills and video onto tables, walls, floors and even paper. Its ability to be powered through batteries just opens up so many doors. That and it’s really small – 81mm x 131mm x 131mm. The device requires two parts to work, the projector itself and the included wireless HDMI unit. How does it project content? Well the HDMI unit works by connecting to your media source, a PC, TV, smartphone or tablet, and it’ll wirelessly transmit the source to the projector that’ll blast it on surfaces. Resolution-wise it’ll project at an auto-focused resolution of 1366 x 768. Equip with 100 lumens brightness and capable of putting up a projection between 22 and 80 inches. When your source device is near to the actual projector, it’ll be able to pick up media from it and connect through Bluetooth (4.0) Low Energy to display media automatically. The battery is quoted at two hours of projection and it’ll take double that to charge it up fully. Sony’s projector also has built-in dual speakers for any accompanying audio in your videos. It’ll be compatible with Android (4.4 or later) or iOS 9 devices. Sony’s Portable Ultra Throw Projector will retail for  ¥  92,500 (RM 3,503) and will be released on the 13th of February in Japan.  This isn’t the first time Sony puts a crazy price on things. Their  4K version  of the same thing (shown above) goes for a whooping  ¥  5,000,000 – yes that’s RM 189,409.

There’s no proper name for this flaw yet but it’s been labelled “ CVE-2016-0728” for now and it’s gonna be a big problem .

A few manufacturers have tried to uphold their monthly security updates including Google, HTC and Samsung but when dealing with a gaping hole that has been there since 2013, we hope they do something soon. The issue now lies in the OS keyring that allows apps to store sensitive data in the form that is encrypted so it can’t be accessed. To exemplify the dangers of this bug, the team at Perception Point replicated the exploit that replaces the keyring code stored in the memory kernel. Particularly on Android smartphones for those on KitKat and later, the exploit will allow malicious apps to break out of the sandbox to gain control of the OS’ root functions.

This is because WhatsApp realises that many of their customers did not possess credit or debit cards and were afraid of losing their access to this service. According to the company, nearly a billion people around the world rely on this app to stay in touch with their friends and family across the globe. Since this app can basically let you reach as far as there is some semblance of an Internet connection, rural folks were worried that — due to their limited to non-existent access to banking services — they would lose this connection to their loved ones. Besides that, WhatsApp has also ensured their users that they would not be resorting to third-party advertisements on their application to generate income. Instead, they’re testing tools that will allow users to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organisations that they want to talk to. Think of it as a messaging gateway for enterprises.  For example, you could possibly communicate with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about your recent flight delay. Also imagine being able to receive TAC PIN number from your bank on WhatsApp instead of SMS. This means instant updates that could otherwise take hours — a good idea in concept at least. The thing about this is, have you ever paid for WhatsApp?

Rory Lee,Huawei P9 to come in four models — one of which has a dual-camera set up,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/19/huawei-p9-to-come-in-four-models-one-of-which-has-a-dual-camera-set-up/,"Android,Barcelona,dual camera,huawei,Huawei P9,Huawei P9 enhanced,Huawei P9 variants,Huawei P9lite,Huawei P9max,Kirin 950,MWC,rumour,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-01-19,"Big smartphone manufacturers seem to love adding variants to their popular devices so you can pretty much expect at least two versions of what is essentially the same smartphone (or at least under the same line) that will cater to different people’s needs.  Huawei  isn’t bucking this trend as new information has surfaced that they’re launching four different variants of their upcoming  P9  handset — one more than last year. What’s more, the fourth device will feature a dual rear camera setup. According to a report on VentureBeat by Evan Blass, otherwise known as  @evleaks , Huawei’s P9 lineup will include the regular P9, a budget-friendly P9lite, a larger P9max as well as an unnamed “feature-enhanced P9″. Although Blass noted that his source fell short of dubbing it a premium model, this enhanced P9 is said to feature a larger screen (though not as large as the P9max) more RAM, more internal storage as well as a dual 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. This isn’t new for the Chinese smartphone manufacturer however as they’ve already tried the dual-camera set up on the 2014-2015  honor 6 Plus . In fact, this new P9’s camera is supposed to be a second generation upgrade of that very dual-camera. Therefore, it will likely mean that the P9’s dual-camera will offer the same additional features afforded by the honor 6 Plus’ like post-capture refocus, simulated aperture adjustment and filter application plus what VentureBeat says will be “even more unique capabilities” as this camera concept has been further refined. Is two better than one? If our  earlier leak  on the upcoming LG G5 is any indication, it would appear smartphone manufacturers definitely think so, as that device is rumoured to sport not only a dual-screen setup like the LG V10 but also a dual rear mounted camera. That said, these are merely rumours as there has been no official confirmation beyond a person with alleged knowledge of Huawei so take this with a grain of salt. One thing is for sure though none of the P9 variants will feature a QHD resolution screen (2560×1440 pixels). As with all Huawei devices (except the Nexus 6P which we can all argue can be considered more of a Google device), the company feels that the slightly better screen and image quality offered by a QHD screen just isn’t worth the shorter battery life. We were pretty  impressed  with the Mate S’ battery life, so maybe they do know what they’re doing. As far as specs are concerned, Blass’ source didn’t reveal anything, but we did come across a device that posted a  blistering score  on Geekbench that we believe could be the Kirin 950-powered Huawei P9. With that kind of horsepower and now a dual-camera, suffice to say we’re excited. Despite all of this information and anticipation, Blass indicates that Huawei will not launch these smartphones during the Barcelona Mobile World Congress’ timeframe, choosing instead to give them a dedicated launch several weeks after MWC. However, it is said that Huawei is expected to unveil a Surface Book-like 2-in-1 in Barcelona next month but there are unfortunately no details on this product for the time being. [ SOURCE ]"

Sony has just laid out its calling card and they’ll be vying the attention of tech sites at the same conference as Samsung and LG; sending  out invitations for a special press conference a day after its two competitors intend to release their biggest devices of the year. But what could they release? The flagship Xperia line was just announced at IFA in September. So it couldn’t be that. What about a tablet? or the alleged bezeless Xperia C6?  We’re not quite sure just yet but if they want to enter the ring with Samsung and LG – both of whom are going to release flagship smartphones – they better put something good on the show floor. If it would be a tablet, it’ll be a follow-up to the Xperia Z4 tablet and that would indeed make a (good) fuss. Sony’s tablets are no pushovers and has been a beacon of light in the disarray that is Android tablets. Their Xperia Z2 Tablet being (an early) example of how they can produce great slates and the Xperia Z4 Tablet that followed it. It’s also plausible that Sony might announce some new wearable during Mobile World Congress but to hold an event the same day as two competitors that are going to release their biggest devices of the year with a wearable seems even less likely. IFA 2015 was just four months ago and Sony can’t be too brash when it comes to refreshing their flagship Xperia Z line – we’d prefer to think as such since we’ve already advised them to use a longer product-cycle to develop something that’ll change the smartphone game. Repeating our status quo, Sony has to stop playing safe and take some risks. Change up their looks and look towards starting a new trend. They’ve got to risk it for the biscuit so to say. If they don’t, the company may start reconsidering the position of their Mobile division and the ambiguous “ alternative options ” cloud that hangs above them isn’t something they should play with. The Japanese company better watch out, cause if they fail to shock us positively when trying to steal that thunder from LG and Samsung, they’re going to be an afterthought we won’t bother with.

The one that’s never more than an arm’s reach from you at all times. The one that has probably been in the bathroom with you more times than the toilet roll has. Yes,  that  one. Of course, if you’re already reading this on your smartphone then I do apologise for being an idiot by choosing this intro, but I digress. How does your smartphone  feel ? And no, I don’t mean this in a metaphorical out-of-body-experience sense, I mean this in a literal sense. We spend every waking moment (some sleeping) of our lives holding onto a little brick that probably weighs no more than a really heavy spoon at a posh restaurant, but most of us put little to no thought into how a device feels in the hand when deciding on a purchase. It’s all about specs and that’s rather unfortunate. I was scrolling lazily through  r/Android  one day when I noticed an interesting  entry  by  u/liquidspacedragon  (props for the dope name) asking the subreddit about what Android phone they felt had the best feel in the hand. Honestly, the responses surprised me — there were a surprising number of non-metal smartphones. That got me thinking, what  was  the best feeling smartphone I’ve ever held in my hand? With all the smartphone manufacturers pursuing metal and glass bodied phones as the agreed ‘standard’ for a premium build and feel, the question becomes: Does that really give the best feel in the hand? Based on the Reddit thread the answer was no. So, I asked the other writers here at SoyaCincau.com, as well as the other sites under the  Mind Blow network , to see if we could find out. Here are what we think are the best phones we’ve ever held in our hands before. Keep in mind, specs don’t matter."

This report claims that kids aged seven to 17 have been made workers for a Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) based arm of Huayou Cobalt – Congo Dongfang Mining (CDM). Evidence implies that CDM is buying this precious element used to make batteries from traders that purchase their stock from areas infamous for child labour.

In an attempt to get a response, the NGO went through the customer list of 16 conglomerates based on public data. Most deny knowledge of any such incidents going on but for Apple and Microsoft, they openly acknowledged that they were reevaluating their suppliers. at the same time, Amnesty mentions that none of the 16 companies provided enough information to successfully retrace the origins of the cobalt supply. Interviews with 87 workers (including children aged 9 to 17) helped exposed the behind-the-scenes of how our lithium-ion cells are made . These individuals spend nearly 12 hours in artisanal cobalt mines in the DRC and have been documented in photographs and video recordings. The documentation shows that the kids that are abused in this process essentially work above ground, collecting and cleaning rocks from these sites and nearby waterways. They face abhorrent conditions having to carry well above their weight, constantly abused physically and breathe in all the hazardous gas and chemicals associated with these sites that abandon safety guidelines and don’t provide protective gear. Facing the surroundings of the site, often they become ill and develop lung diseases that eventually lead to death in some cases. Click to enlarge Making up at least 50% of the world’s cobalt supply, the DRC’s industry was previously a nation-owned corporation but that fell after the collapse of the Congolese economy in the 1990s. Now the government relies on miners specialising in the art to dig up cobalt that’s too risky for industrial mining. It takes two to clap in this situation and no matter the secrecy of this occurrences, we hope all the companies highlighted in this report does everything they can to ensure that this epidemic stops.

He’s earned billions by making business decisions in his own companies and thinks he’s the best man to seek business advice from. In this case, the way Apple’s manufacturing system operates. Speaking to an audience at Liberty University earlier today, Mr Trump as he’s so fondly referred to on the Apprentice, shared some of his insights on how to make Apple more American.  We’re not talking about Apple Pie here. Imposing his good-sense, he began by suggesting businesses who produce goods out of the country should be hit by a 35% tax for putting their factories overseas. This is the same man who supposedly supports free trade. The front-runner for the Republican Party ended by saying: “We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries.” Remember, this man has a net worth of an estimated 4.5 billion USD and he’s built an empire worthy enough to shout about but what about Apple? Well, the Cupertino-based outfit  achieved  sales over US$ 200 billion, with a net profit of US$ 45 billion and have assets accumulating to that of US$ 260 billion. So who really has the bigger piggy bank here? To suggest that Apple throws aside deals with Foxconn (full list  here ) and others is just plain silly. Regardless if Trump were to become President or not, he’d have to push for new legislations that allow him to have those fundamental powers in the first place. It’s a given that Apple utilises overseas supply partnerships because other parts of the world simply have bigger factories, a larger workforce and overall bigger set up. The makers of the iPhone outsource their labour and manufacturing because it maximises profit. Trump is not shy to make outlandish remarks every typical day while on stage but for him to do this would require a method to penalise these companies. To the extent that he’ll have to convince them America match China’s production capabilities – in its own, requires a lot of funding and implementation. Sure, if Apple decided to be more-American (if there’s ever such a thing), it would spur the local economy – more jobs will be available, worker conditions would likely be better than that of Foxconn’s and you’ll get “Made in America” on devices.

Weibo again comes to the rescue with rumours suggesting that Huawei will enter the PC segment with a device dubbed “MateBook” – cue raised eyebrows. Following the success of the  Nexus 6P , the Huawei name has been passed around worldwide and brand recognition has never been this good. It’s also because of the brand’s decision to start branching out into parts of Europe and launching the  Mate S ,  honor 7 , and  Mate 8  among others in international markets. They’re off to a good start with a showing at  CES 2016  but is dabbling in too many areas going to bite them in the butt? Chinese brands have been ambitious and their fearlessness to put the best package at an affordable price is hard to beat.  Whether or not it’s ambitious to propose Huawei getting into the PC realm, they might just do it after all. Emerging rumours have mentioned that a hybrid laptop will come out of Huawei’s factories soon. They claim that it’ll be a dual-booting Windows/Android hybrid but we’re not sure anyone would bother running the two OS’ in tandem. Some assume it’ll be a Chromebook running machine and that’s more likely than a dual-boot system. Recently, their number one competitor Xiaomi released a tablet that runs either Windows or Android and this could easily be Huawei’s answer to the  Mi Pad 2 . They’ll meet other stiff competition too, with the likes of Microsoft, Google and Samsung also at the table. It’s never easy using Google Translate to piece together a story as highlighted by Android Authority. There’s a good chance that the lines of communication got somewhat blurred while being passed down like Chinese Whisper. Will Huawei release a laptop/hybrid in the near future? We’d like to think so.

We already knew the wave of rumours were beginning since we’re halfway into January with MWC 2016 hot on the heels a month away. Based on numerous reports, it’s likely that Samsung will announce four devices of the Galaxy S7 series when the mobile related festivities begin in Barcelona. They’re listed as Galaxy S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge+. Reports have given a rough idea that the Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge+ does indeed exist. You might have also seen postings on how Spigen accidentally started selling cases for the “supposed” four devices on amazon. You can read about it  here .   Evleaks has already shown off the alleged banner that suggest that the Galaxy S7, S7 edge and S7 edge+ will make its grand opening in a month’s time. And in terms of what processors they’ll be running, leaks  way back  said they’ll be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and an Exynos 8890 models – usually region specific. Here’s the note that was released months back: Take note of the model numbers and see how they tally up with the Indonesian listings below: You’ve got one that uses the code SM-G930FD and another that uses SM-G935FD. So for one you can believe that at least two devices will arrive during MWC 2016. Based on model names, it seems likely these two numbers match up with the next generation of flagship Galaxys/Galaxies. The same deductions can be made based on the number that differentiates the edge variant from the regular Galaxy S# models. With the flat flagship carrying the “0” number at the end while the edged version ends with a number “5”. The lettering, on the other hand, represents the interchanging processor options – “A” for snapdragon and “F” for the Exynos chipsets. We’re referring to listings of the older Dual-SIM Galaxy S6 that used this code: SM-G920FD. So if this listing holds water, it would mean that the Indonesian market will be getting both a Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge – both Dual-SIM and both using an Exynos processor. Malaysians have a high chance of getting the same duo as well if the past is any indication. For further reading on what features and internals could make their way onto the Galaxy S7 series, head on over  here . After checking the  certification site , it seems that the listing has been removed. Maybe Samsung noticed and got it removed or it never existed in the first place. What we’re getting at is these are rumours and leaks so always take them with a pinch on salt. In the case that Samsung does release four devices, we’d think that would be cannibalising the Note5’s market share and that’ll definitely be unfavourable if they were to out a Galaxy S7+.

Some timely information, given that last week we  talked  about how the iPhone 6s Plus destroys every (currently available) smartphone out there on AnTutu – Android is back with a vengeance – or at least when this unknown Huawei device comes to light. Keeping up with current rumours, it seems that the device we’re talking about is none other than the Huawei P9. It’s assumed that it’ll arrive with a home-grown Octa-core Kirin 950 processor and a Mali T880 MP4 GPU. This processor is built based on a 16nm fabrication process and it utilises 4 high-performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that can be clocked up to 2.3GHz and followed suit by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores clocked at a more efficient 1.8GHz. It’ll run the a big.LITTLE configuration, that allows that Octa-core processor to efficiently run to deliver the best performance at the optimal power consumption. Further reading about the Kirin 950 processor can be found  here . Based off purported images showing a device by Huawei hitting a home-run in the multi-core test of the famous benchmark test. If the 7313 multi-core is true, you could say that the Kirin 950 processor is going to be a beast.  Reports claim that together with the Kirin 950 SoC, the P9 will don the same 5.2-inch screen that its predecessor did, together with 4GB of RAM and Android 6.0 Marshmallow running the operating system show. The Kirin 950 processor beats the current chart-topper in the MediaTek Heli X20 that runs in a Deca-core format – 7037. But out of the four big guns of chipsets, the current front-runner is still (supposedly) the Exynos 8890 that’s slated to be on the Samsung Galaxy S7 devices that’ll be announced come MWC 2016. The breakdown of performance is shown in a graph provided below: Click image to enlarge We echo the sentiments that usually when undergoing testing, manufacturers clock these processors lower to prevent complications and gradually ramp the clocked speeds once they’re happy with how the device runs – heat and all. Then again, these leaks could turn out to be fake, so be wary when seeing them. As detailed in our earlier article, the times of unbelievably fast (on paper) processors really have superseded the needs of their users.

After which, we started seeing the Apple wearable start gaining traction (at least in published sales reports).  They were number two, behind Fitbit – if these numbers were indeed true but with sales dwarfing that of other mainstream smartwatch brands (e.g. Samsung and Pebble), would Cupertino allow the Apple Watch to see out a longer product cycle to ensure big advancements across versions? Or will they make small refinements across generations – like we’ve seen on the iPhones with a distinctive “s” being all the difference. TechCrunch’s latest report believes it could be one or the other. Based on multiple sources, the report suggests that we could see the same Apple Watch (in essence) tieing up with designers and add-on accessory makers but no massive changes in hardware. Contradictory to the fact, other sources claim that there will be one major difference on the latest smartwatch from Apple: a FaceTime camera. An analyst from Creative Strategies, a market research firm says that dormant supply chain checks are key signs that no new Apple Watch is currently being produced. He continues by saying the cuts in component providers’ supply chains, it just doesn’t add up that a new smartwatch would be on the way – if anything, production should’ve started in the tail end of 2015 to be out by the first half of 2016. Mr Bajarin, observes that in light of this information, Apple’s product patterns might take a big shift in direction. On the software side of things, it seems to be just as quiet and that seems to just add fire to the assumption of the Apple Watch 2.0 announcement being a long way off. But then again WatchOS2 was just announced a while back, so there’s that to consider as well. Will Apple have a keynote in March? Definitely. What will unveil during that time? The Apple Watch 2.0 would be unlikely. Changing the product-cycle of the Apple Watch could bring some good after all.

LG  was even apparently moving their volume and power buttons back to the side of their smartphones. While all of that were just rumours before this, now we have what looks like actual confirmation of what the device will look like as well as some of its hardware features. Android Authority received an exclusive tip from Shai Mizrachi in which they came into possession of several LG G5 diagrams showing exactly what the phone will look like on the outside as well as its dimensions. Based on the diagram, it does indeed look like the phone will have a flat design unlike that of the previous  G4  and  G Flex  models. Besides that the diagram confirms that the G5’s volume control buttons will be placed at the side of the smartphone while the power button remains put beneath the camera module (likely where the fingerprint sensor will reside as well). It does seems kind of silly to have a clickable button at the back, but then again we’ve doubted the back button placement before and that turned out pretty well in the end. Speaking of that camera module, while it does look like a massive module, it seems that there will only be one camera at the back. Judging from the cutout in the middle plus the earlier concepts by CNet Korea, the rest of to module will be home to the dual-tone LED flash and a laser autofocus. It also looks like the G5 will indeed be thinner, taller and wider than the LG G4, measuring in at 149.4 x 73.9 x 8.2mm versus the G4’s 148.9 x 76.1 x 6.3-9.8mm. Unfortunately, while this diagram does confirm a lot about the device, there is no mention of specs or what exactly the body will be made of.

The pink flagship smartphone is offered by Maxis from as low as RM93/month on its  Zerolution  program.  Retailing at RM2,699 (with GST), Maxis Zerolution lets you own the device with no upfront payments and no interest charges on your monthly installments. The easy ownership program lets you own the Galaxy Note5 today and have the option to switch to a newer phone hassle-free after 12 months.  The RM93/month installment for the device is for 24 months duration and you’ll need to top up RM30/month for the Zerolution upgrade option. For added protection and to avoid penalty charges when upgrading, you can opt for its Premium Protection Plan for an extra RM23/month. This is basically insurance that covers your device for theft, cracks and even if it is damaged by water. So in total, you’re looking at RM146/month if you tick all the boxes. It appears to be a price increase for the protection plan, as the option costs just  RM15/month  last year. Note that the Zerolution program does not include your actual mobile plan subscription and you’ll need to subscribe to MaxisONE Plan that starts from RM98/month. As an extra bonus, those that take up the Galaxy Note5 Zerolution offer, can get additional 12GB of internet across 6 months and a golden mobile number if you’re on MaxisONE 128 plan and above.

Arif Lee,Sony’s Xperia Z5 & Z5 Compact won’t come with fingerprint sensors in the US: We think we know why,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/18/sonys-xperia-z5-z5-compact-wont-come-with-fingerprint-sensors-in-the-us-we-think-we-know-why/,"America,Compact,Sony,Sony America,Sony USA,sony xperia z5,sony xperia z5 compact,United States,USA,Xperia,xperia z5,Xperia Z5 compact,Z5","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2016-01-18,"Sometimes the first time is a test run. The Japanese manufacturer did a first when they put a fingerprint sensor on the  Xperia Z5  series and their decision has now come back to haunt them. It’ll go on sale next month in the United States but it’ll be missing the biometric security component that’s available in other markets. And we think we know why. While quite far-fetched, the probably intentional delay of the US release of their Xperia Z5 line could mean that  Sony  had a chance to see if their new fingerprint sensor would be a hit or otherwise. Following which, they would take note the feedback of their side-placed fingerprint sensor, and decide if it’s worthy to risk having the power button doubles as the fingerprint scanner. Mainly because, it doesn’t work (well). When asked why they decided to pull the scanner, they simply said: “it was a business decision”. Android Authority has reached out for further clarification but has yet to hear back. Sony already has a lot on their plate and if these issues keep cropping up, they better make sure their next flagship makes the cut. This is their first run at such technology on their devices and while we could argue they should’ve perfected it before putting it out, we’ll cut them some slack. This move could be a good one, provided that they make changes to the prices to reflect the lack of a fingerprint sensor. Maybe Americans are better off not dealing with the annoying fingerprint sensor that we talked about in our  review  of the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual. It’ll save them a lot of pain.

Arif Lee,UberX now up to 50% cheaper in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/18/uber-malaysia-has-just-slashed-prices-on-uberx/,"getting around in Malaysia,prices of Uber,Uber,Uber fares,Uber Malaysia,Uber prices,Uber X,Uberx,UberX Johor Bahru,UberX KL,UberX Penang,UberX Rates","Cool stuff,Mobile Apps",2016-01-18,"Getting around our hectic nation is already hard as it is and it’s only the beginning of 2016. A reliance of our cars might rise since fuel prices are lower than usual but knowing markets, they could easily balloon again.  Despite cheaper petrol, most car manufacturers upped their price-points, toll prices and public transport has raised their prices too and well… let’s just say it’s going to be tough getting here and there with our economy being the way it is. Considering all the factors,  Uber  Malaysia has decided to make their  uberX  rides more affordable. Kuala Lumpur Bringing some joy to Uber riders, they’ve revised the Klang Valley fares to reflect the breakdown above. Previously, those riding on uberX were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. So they’ve lowered the base fares by RM0.55 and decreased the per minute cost from RM0.30 to RM0.25. Per kilometer pricing has remained at RM0.60. Uber thinks that lowering prices would, in turn, make more people use it – pretty much a given but they hope this will bring better remuneration for the people behind the wheel of Uber cars too. They’ve given a comparison table of the old and the new fares  in between points and how much the prices have decreased. For short distances, this translates up to 50% less compared to the previous rate. At the same time, they’ve dropped prices for uberX rides in Penang and Johor as well. Penang Previously, those riding on uberX in Penang were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. So they’ve lowered the base fares by RM0.60 and decreased the per minute cost from RM0.30 to RM0.25. Per kilometer pricing has also been reduced to RM0.55. That’s roughly a 15% decreasing in overall pricing. Johor Bahru Previously, those riding on uberX in Johor were charged at RM1.50 for base fare followed by RM0.20/minute and RM0.60/KM. So they’ve lowered the base fares by RM0.50 and per kilometer pricing has also been reduced to RM0.50. But increased the per minute cost from RM0.20 to RM0.25. The above is a comparison table of the old and the new fares  in between points and how much the prices have decreased for those in Johor. It works out to about 15% cheaper fares.   Relying on data from their case study in New York, they saw a gradual growth of partner driver earnings once they dropped prices every year. In the span of 3 years (2002 to 2015) they make Uber rides cheaper by 30% and following the trend was driver earnings. True enough, once prices dropped, drivers were busier and they spent their hours more efficiently. More trips, less idle times means more money. Hey, after all, the people ferrying us here and there deserve to be earning a good wage too and it doesn’t hurt us one bit. Let’s hope Uber can maintain standards and keep both riders and drivers happy. You can download your Uber app at these links for  iOS  and  Android . [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  3  ]"

In fact, most smartwatches suffer this same fate, which is why fitness trackers that are cheaper but still retain many smartwatch functions, like  Fitbit ‘s lineup, have been  immensely popular . Well,  Samsung  wants to try their hand at shaking up the budget fitness tracker market as the company is allegedly working on a fitness tracker with a new, dare we say revolutionary, feature up its sleeve. Not only is it supposed to improve on the current tracker’s existing functions, it will add depth to fitness trackers as well allowing things like a bioelectrical impedance analysis, a detailed breakdown of organ measurements, an electrocardiogram showing electrical activity of one’s heart and a graph showing skin temperature.

Despite top-of-the-line hardware, it seems the Windows 10 OS just isn’t a match for the other established mobile operating systems. But, Microsoft is not done releasing new  Lumia s as we now have what looks like an official date for the  Lumia 650 : February 1. However, there is also word that this could be the last Lumia smartphone of this year. So,  Surface Phone  anyone? Rendered image of the Lumia 650 According to Windows Central, multiple sources have confirmed with them that February 1 will be the date that Microsoft reveals details about the device including pricing and availability. This device is said to feature a 5-inch 1280×720 pixel HD display with a quad-core Snapdragon 212 (or 200) processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD). It is also said to have an 8MP/5MP rear-front camera combo with an LED flash. What is interesting is that they also note that this could very well be the last Lumia device of 2016 as they said both the rumoured Lumia 850 and Lumia 750 have been  cancelled  in July of 2015. Then again that article also said that the Lumia 550 was cancelled, so, as with all rumours, take it with a grain of salt. With the abrupt cancellation of both Lumia devices, it is unlikely that Microsoft will sit on their hands and not launch any more mobile devices this year. So if there are no more Lumias what else does Microsoft have in their pipeline? A Surface Phone perhaps? An earlier report by Windows Central indicated that the much-anticipated smartphone developed by Microsoft’s Surface team — for now dubbed the Surface Phone — could see a release in the  second half of 2016 . The Surface lineup has always been associated with premium quality devices, so we know that this team knows what they’re doing when it comes to mobile devices. Although, they have received some flak for the  Surface Book  and  Pro 4 , but that was mostly down to the buggy software it was shipped with. This then brings us to the persisting problem that is Windows 10. One of the biggest reasons to the lukewarm reception of the  Lumia 950  and  Lumia 950 XL  was the fact that it is running on an operating system that just doesn’t seem ready yet. The specs are good, the camera is good, the build is…well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves there, but the software is just so unsuited for mobile usage. Unless their software game takes a significant step up where you can actually see people moving from other operating systems to Windows 10 (mobile), all the brilliant hardware in the world won’t be able to save you. Things will be even worse if you slap an exorbitant price tag on it. What do you guys think? Are you hyped to see a new Windows 10 powered phone? Or do you share our sentiments?

Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom camera comparison: Does optical zoom really make a difference?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/16/asus-zenfone-zoom-camera-comparison-does-optical-zoom-really-make-a-difference/,,,2016-01-16,"ASUS  recently  launched  the world’s thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone, the  ZenFone Zoom , here in Malaysia and the first question on everyone’s mind is: Whats the big deal? Now the word “optical zoom” may not be a term everyone recognises. Some of you might be thinking that your current smartphones can zoom jolly well, so why would you bother about this device? You see, the zoom commonly found on your smartphone camera is what people call “digital zoom” which essentially crops the image to a smaller frame and enlarges to make it seem like you’re bringing the subject closer to you. No lens movement happens within the camera module. On the other hand, conventional DSLRs and their respective lenses use “optical zoom” which works when the different elements that make up a lens move around to refract light differently, bringing the image closer to you. The biggest difference though is that when you use digital zoom to zoom in on a subject, you lose quality, because you are no longer using the full image — rather you’re only using a cropped fraction of it. Optical zoom then is the way to go if you want to zoom (but not with your feet) and you don’t want to lose image quality at the same time. If the benefits are so great, why don’t more manufacturers equip their smartphones with optical zoom? The biggest reason is size. With more than one element in your lens, the whole camera module tends to get pretty ginormous. Think  Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom  or the  Galaxy K Zoom . However, with ASUS’s 13-megapixel camera on the ZenFone Zoom, they have used a special dual-periscope design to mount the camera horizontally across the back of the smartphone, letting them hide the camera bump with the ZenFone’s signature curved back. But, to say that this tiny lens array strapped to the back of a smartphone is on par with those on a DSLR’s lens might be pushing it. In fact, we weren’t even that convinced this whole “optical zoom smartphone” thing would work very well. So, while we were at the launch event, we came up with the brilliant idea of pitting ASUS’s camera-centric ZenFone Zoom against some of the best cameras in the market right now. And whaddya know, we conveniently had a  Nexus 6P , a  Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+  and an  Apple iPhone 6s Plus  with us at the time. Here’s the camera zoom shootout you’ve been waiting for."

Some of us have tried it out for ourselves first hand. It seemed like a gigantic design oversight by the South Korean electronics giant, but the solution was a simple one — don’t put the pen in backwards. Sometimes, accidents happen and it seems that  Samsung  has picked up on that as they’ve quietly fixed this gigantic flaw with the S Pen via a hardware modification to their newer Galaxy Note5 models. But, as there is no way of telling if your device has the fix, please don’t try this with your own device. Based on the image, it looks like Samsung have added a little lever (left) to the original circuit board which looks like it will allow users to eject the S Pen if it were inserted the wrong way. According to Phandroid’s sources, this new mechanism works beautifully despite the fact that it looks like it is being held together by some tape. We don’t think that’s how Samsung will actually hold the lever there, but if there is a fix for this issue it is pretty good news. However, since Samsung made the oversight in the first place, we’re sure many of the early Galaxy Note5 adopters must be pissed that their device doesn’t have this hardware fix. Plus, since Samsung seems to have ninja-fixed this, it doesn’t look like they want others to find out about it which is kind of a bummer. While we’d like to hope that Samsung will offer a hotfix for this problem to existing Galaxy Note5 users, we highly doubt that will be the case. Do you own a Galaxy Note5?

They aimed high with a range of 80 to 100 million devices but they fell slightly short last year. Still that’s not too bad as they haven’t even started to enter Western markets. In a post on social site Weibo, Lin Bin posts how the company managed to sell 70 million devices just last year alone. Xiaomi’s reasoning for the less than stellar was because the result comes at the time that the Chinese market is rather saturated. Eventually, their domestic smartphone market started to slow and they had to compete against Huawei, who have been ramping up brand awareness internationally with appearances at CES 2016 and launches in Europe. Huawei also took to new heights being the first Chinese manufacturer to take a crack at a Nexus device, giving them an advertising opportunity for those who’ve never heard of them. It’ll be hard for Xiaomi to replicate their own success from 2014, seeing the company’s annual smartphone sales catapult by 226% from 2013. Playing with the big boys by starting to utilise metal in their smartphones will be a tough one. The jump from “affordable and good” to “premium and worth the money” is a long stretch. But at least, they’ve already started by moving towards non-polycarbonate materials, looking at alternative operating systems and occasionally releasing more than one processor variant of a device to reach wider markets. If they maintain competitive prices, the brand could easily plaster themselves all over the world. Now it’s down to the consumers, who will have to start changing their mentality and accept that Chinese smartphones can be just as good as devices from US, South Korea and Japan. Once Xiaomi manages to find its way around Western markets then we might see their untapped potential start coming alive but they’ll have to tweak the brand’s image slightly. In the light of this, we only have one question for co-founders Lei Jun and Lin Bin. Are you okay? In all honestly, we don’t think the company has missed too many steps and hope to see them continue to improve in 2016. The Mi 5 coming in February should bring about greater things for Xiaomi and it’s only the beginning of the year. We think you’re doing (better than) okay .

Before v6.0 of the app, the report only consisted of Android phones. With this new version, though, 2015’s report is the first cross-platform ranking report and my goodness was it an interesting one. While we weren’t that surprised that the  iPhone 6s Plus  was #1 on their list, we were shocked at how MUCH further it was from the competition. Let me give you a hint: 132k. According to the popular cross-platform benchmarker, the average score of an iPhone 6s Plus is 132,620 points, the only device to break the 100k mark in 2015. On paper, this gap doesn’t seem possible as the iPhone 6s Plus is powered by a dual-core Twister A9 chip that is clocked at a tame 1.84GHz  and a PowerVR GT7600 GPU paired with (a frankly depressing) 2GB of RAM. Comparatively, the second placed  Huawei Mate 8  packs a monstrous next-gen octa-core Kirin 950 SoC — four Cortex A72 CPU cores clocked at 2.3GHz, four Cortex A53 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz and a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU — plus 4GB of RAM. Yet somehow the iPhone 6s Plus outperforms it by about 30%. It is worth noting that the top 3 performing phones all run on full HD displays so they have less pixels to push compared to their Quad-HD competitors. As we move down the ladder, we find the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipsets occupying places three to five with the  Meizu PRO 5  leading the pack. Not surprising since it only runs a 1080p full-HD display opposed to the  Galaxy Note5  and  Galaxy S6 edge+ ‘s Quad-HD display. Just after the Samsung chips comes 2014’s  iPhone 6 Plus , scoring a respectable 80,554 average score. Not bad for a 2014 phone especially if you take a look at the phones below it. Yup, in case you didn’t notice it yet we have not come across a single Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip yet. Coming in at 7th is the first and best-performing Snapdragon 810 smartphone, the  OnePlus 2 . A “2016 flagship killer” got killed by a phone from 2014. Oops. Scoring an average just shy of 80,000 the OnePlus 2 edges just ahead of the Letv Le 1 Pro,  Xiaomi Mi Note Pro  while Google’s  Nexus 6P  rounds out the 10. I guess it REALLY isn’t about how much horsepower you have, it’s about how you use it. However, it is worth noting that these are average scores so the number of benchmarks ran as well as the conditions in which these benchmarks were run should also factor into the results. That said, I don’t think anything short of a nuclear war could stop the iPhone 6s Plus from running away with the crown. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"
Rory Lee,Netflix is sick and tired of your VPN and Proxies,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/15/netflix-is-sick-and-tired-of-your-vpn-and-proxies/,"Netflix,Netflix blocking proxy,Netflix blocking VPN,Netflix Malaysia,Netflix Malaysia proxy,Netflix Malaysia VPN,Netflix Proxy,Netflix VPN,proxy,vpn","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS,Windows 10",2016-01-15,"Netflix  recently went “global” and everyone got very excited. We’ve all heard good things about this streaming service, from the shows they have to the quality of their stream plus all the Netflix exclusives like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. It’s gotten so popular that we see it mentioned in TV shows themselves, that one time in Suits when Mike Ross wanted to piss Edward Darby off for example. But, when we took a hard look at their catalogue from our Malaysian accounts, we were quite bummed out that there were so  many shows missing . Even popular comedy series How I Met Your Mother wasn’t there. So the craftier of us went ahead and used VPNs (Virtual Private Network) and proxies to mask our IP addresses and as a result, gain more access to their content. Well, it seems like Netflix has had enough of our scheming ways and has said openly that they’re putting a stop to VPN users once and for all. For those of you who don’t know what a VPN or proxy does, it basically masks your IP address, preventing a website — Netflix for example — from finding out where you are connecting from. So, with a VPN or proxy you can set it up to have the site or app detect that you’re connecting from an American IP address, for example, then the region locked site would grant you access to their content as if you were coming from the US. If you’d like a more detailed explanation you can head on over to Gizmodo’s article on  how VPNs work . In short when it comes to Netflix, this allows you to bypass region restrictions and circumvent the walls Netflix have put up (because of licensing, censorship and other technical reasons) and have access to whatever content you want — something Netflix is clearly upset about. In a blog statement by Netflix Vice President of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar, he said that Netflix would continue to enforce content licensing according to geographical location. However, they did say that they were working on making all their content available to all their subscribers — something they anticipate being able to do. For now, though, they’re focusing on blocking proxies and ensuring that you can only access content from your own region. Although they didn’t say exactly how or when they would block the proxies aside from a vague “as technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it” line. One possible way we could see them doing it is locking your account by credit card. For example, if you wanted to use an American account, you would have to have an American credit card, likewise, if you’re using a Malaysian credit card you can only access the Malaysian Netflix content. Although they could also take more drastic measures and force you to use your IC/identification numbers to register. Though we doubt it since it would cause some amount of hindrance to user experience. Either way, it looks like your proxy days are numbered.

Arif Lee,Sony Xperia Z5 Dual Review: A decent flagship but it’s time for a reboot,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/15/sony-xperia-z5-dual-review-malaysia/,,,2016-01-15,"Competing in a market with Apple and Samsung is definitely tough to do, more so when you have affordable Chinese brands chipping away at your market share. You have to juggle between innovating, designing, marketing and setting price points. So far,  Sony  has been on the short end of the stick but they were once in a very different position. This Japanese company used to be offer different designs and qualities in their smartphones. They once tried different things and were daring enough to explore angles that others didn’t. We had the CyberShot and Walkman lines from the Sony Ericsson days. Then on after restructuring to be “Sony” they came up with their first device, the  Xperia S  as well as the  Xperia Ion , their first 4G LTE smartphone. Change is necessary if they want to be competitive Moving with the times, their competitors have shaken up their own brands.  Samsung has started to ditch plastic-backed smartphones, now instead making use of more metal and glass panels – as seen on their mid-range  Galaxy A series .  And as everyone has been noticing, Chinese brands like Xiaomi has begun making metal unibody smartphones. Even using the design on their most affordable device yet – the  Redmi 3 . Huawei, the other Chinese brand has refined their methods and designs to great lengths, now putting great specs and better designs to the point of creating the premium  Mate S . They also partnered with Google to make the flagship  Nexus 6P . So what about Sony? Read on to find out about the  Xperia Z5 Dual ."
Arif Lee,Logitech’s CREATE Keyboard Case for the iPad Pro is now in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/15/logitech-malaysia-launches-the-create-keyboard-case-for-the-ipad-pro/,"apple,Apple iPad Mini 4,apple ipad pro,Apple iPad Pro keyboard,Apple Malaysia,iPad,iPad mini 4,iPad Mini 4 keyboard,iPad Pro,iPad Pro keyboard,iPad Pro keyboard Malaysia,iPad Pro Malaysia,Keyboard,Logitech,Malaysia","iOS,iPad,iPro,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-15,"Peripheral maker Logitech was one of the first third-party accessory makers to announce that they were making a Smart Connect enabled keyboard for the iPad Pro. That was back when the iPad Pro was officially released and has seen many tech sites talk about the typing experience that Logitech offers. If you threw down some serious Ringgit on an iPad Pro, many have suggested this to be the best keyboard option (out of only two keyboards currently available). It’s also more affordable than Apple’s own option which battles us. Apple’s version has keys that are covered by a nylon fabric while Logitech’s is more robust (725 grams) and made out of plastic. The CREATE Keyboard case makes use of the dedicated Smart Connector on the iPad Pro for connecting the two together. Using this technology allows the keyboard to be thin and light as it doesn’t require inbuilt power, drawing that from the Apple tablet it attaches to. This is similar to the technology on the Surface Pro 4. Typing on this keyboard, in theory, should be a good experience as it uses full-size 19mm keys with a key travel of 1.5mm. Each individual key is backlit ensuring you won’t be lost when typing in low-light. Because it is backlit, you’ll have to keep in mind that it’ll draw more power and you’ll have to manually turn the backlighting off when you’re using the iPad Pro while the keyboard is attached. However, it does auto wake and auto sleep when you shut the case, saving battery when doing so. On the keyboard itself, you’ll find an iOS shortcut keys that’ll allow easy navigation through iOS 9. Some of the shortcuts include changing volume, play/pause for music and video, home button, search and etc. More special keys mean you’re less likely to touch the screen and that’s fit nicely with Tim Cook’s suggestion that the iPad Pro will replace a laptop – we don’t think it will, not even close but at least, it’ll help his “reasoning”. Built in a way that makes it adjustable to two angles, users are allowed to orientate it in a manner that eases their interactions with the tablet: typing and viewing mode, as they refer to it. Logitech puts an MSRP price of RM 699 (w/ GST) and you can expect to find it from Bluelogic Enterprise Sdn Bhd and MCL Bhd. At the same time, Logitech also delivered the Focus a protective case with an integrated keyboard for the iPad Mini 4. A similar typing experience with plastic keys but with fewer keys. This keyboard also has iOS shortcuts and is capable of an adjustable viewing angle within its 50-degree range. You can find it at the same retailers mentioned earlier and go for an MSRP of RM 199 (w/ GST). 
 Both keyboards will be available in 3 colours: black, red or blue."

Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom hands-on and first impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/14/asus-zenfone-zoom-malaysia-hands-on-and-first-impressions/,"Asus,ASUS Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,ASUS ZenFone Zoom hands on,ASUS ZenFone Zoom Malaysia,ASUS Zenfone Zoom Malaysia launch,ZenFone Zoom,ZenFone Zoom first impressions,ZenFone Zoom hands on,ZenFone Zoom impressions,ZenFone Zoom Malaysia","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-14,"Yesterday,  ASUS  officially launched the much anticipated  ZenFone Zoom  on Malaysia and we got to spend some time with their new flagship device. Here’s what we think of it. Do note that the white unit with the black camera module is a prototype given to professional photographer Peter Tan. Of course, this device’s party piece lies in its massive camera module that dominates the back of the phone. Its 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor has a 10-element f/2.7-4.8 aperture lens that utilises a dual-periscope horizontal-mount design allowing it to not only have a massive 3x optical zoom, but also maintain a relatively thin form factor.   Besides that the primary camera comes with other goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus and a dual-tone LED flash. To help the camera out in low light, the ZenFone Zoom comes with ASUS’ Pixel Master 2.0 technology which is renown for its low light and long exposure capabilities. If 13-megapixels isn’t enough, ASUS have bundled a Super Resolution function into the camera which allows it to take gigantic 52-megapixel photos, by stitching four 13MP shots together for more detail and clarity. While the sample shots on display (taken by Peter Tan) looked rather impressive, we would have to fully test out the functions for ourselves before making a decision. Being a camera-centric phone, the smartphone comes with dedicated camera hardware buttons — a dedicated shutter and video record button — which were awesome and tactile. The device also has equally tactile dedicated zoom keys that can double as volume rockers when not in the camera app. Zooming in and out with the keys was pretty satisfying as the phone gives you a little buzz when it hits the maximum 3x optical zoom. We did notice that launching the camera from the shutter button (which you can do by holding it down) was a little slow (maybe 2-3) seconds. Besides that, the shutter speed and time between shots were not as snappy as something like an iPhone 6s or a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. However, it does have a complete manual mode with full manual controls that can be easily accessed via a tap of the M button located to the top of the on-screen shutter button. What we were impressed with was the macro capabilities of this device. ASUS boasts a 5cm macro focal distance and from our brief testing, you could get pretty darn close to the subject and still focus with no problems. The front camera is an average 5MP f/2.0 unit with a wide-angle lens and support for Pano Selfie. For a better understanding of this device’s cameras and what optical versus digital zoom really means, stay tuned for our camera comparison. Spec wise, the ZenFone Zoom isn’t all that different from ASUS’ previous flagship, the  ZenFone 2 . It has an updated quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor clocked at 2.5GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (via microSD up to 64GB) storage. The smartphone also comes running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ ZenUI running on top. It’s a shame that it isn’t a more updated version of Android but we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update. Connectivity wise, the device will have a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot and will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi. From our brief hands-on, though, the device handles itself quite well, not stuttering or lagging when switching between applications, then again with 4GB of RAM and a high-end Intel chip, this isn’t really surprising. Being a premium phone, it is definitely built well. The nice rounded metal rails were fabulous to hold in the hand and the back curved nicely to fit in our palms. The camera unit is barely noticeable, letting you believe that it could just be a normal camera. Kudos to ASUS for hiding such a beast of a lens array. ASUS says that the leather on the back of the device is real leather, not some faux nonsense, and we were inclined to believe them…until we took the rear panel off. But, when we held the panel by itself, we started to doubt their claims. That said, the stitching around the “ergonomic hump” is real as we could move the thread around. It felt flimsy and plasticky so be careful when you rip that baby off. The bump on the back to help ergonomics was interesting, to say the least, and we quite liked it since it helped a little with the ergonomics. But as most of us usually take photos with a certain finger positions (like pictured earlier), we didn’t really notice it helping much with grip. What did feel nice were once again the metal rails and those fantastic buttons. ASUS also includes a wrist strap that attaches itself to the back of the device, which is a nice touch. As a whole it was fantastic to hold in the hand and it definitely feels like the premium price you’re paying for. However, do note that from the devices on display, there was a difference between the front of the device between the black model and the white model. The black one will remind you of every other ZenFone model with that familiar chin, but the white one seems to have done away with the chin, instead moving the ASUS logo to the bottom of the device. The device is priced at RM2,099 and ASUS says that the device will be available locally at the end of January."
Rory Lee,ASUS ZenFone Zoom has finally arrived in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/asus-zenfone-zoom-malaysia-official-launch/,"Android,Asus,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,ASUS ZenFone Zoom Malaysia,ASUS Zenfone Zoom Malaysia launch,ASUS Zenfone Zoom Malaysia official launch,smart phone,smartphone,ZenFone Zoom,zenfone zoom launch,Zenfone Zoom Malaysia launch","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-13,"At long last  ASUS  have brought their much-anticipated smartphone, the  ZenFone Zoom , to Malaysia today. Sporting a massive 3x optical zoom camera mounted at the back, this device is supposed to be the thinnest of its kind, featuring a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to the ZenFone series’ familiar curved back. It’s no one-trick-pony either as the smartphone packs a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom Z3590 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable (up to 64GB via microSD) internal storage — plenty for all your photography needs. It also features a 5.5″ full HD display hidden under the protective arm of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. Enough about the performance specs though, we’re interested in that massive camera module. ASUS have mounted their 3x optical zoom glass horizontally across the back of the device allowing its thickness to be greatly reduced. The primary camera itself is a 13-megapixel Panasonic SmartFSI sensor with an f/2.7-4.8 10-element lens and a whole host of goodies like optical image stabilisation (OIS), Pixel Master 2.0, laser autofocus plus a dual-tone LED flash. If you’re worried that 13MP isn’t enough, ASUS have included a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for up to 52-megapixels per photo. Besides that, the camera boasts a 5cm macro shot distance as well as a pro-style Manual mode. The front camera is a modest 5MP f/2.0-aperture, wide angle 88-degree lens with Pano Selfie. While the device itself has nice metal rails — an improvement over the plasticky ZenFone 2 — the back is made of some kind of soft touch leather that ensures the phone is grippy even in one hand. Close to the dedicated shutter and video record button is a slight bump which helps with the ergonomics when you’re shooting pictures with this device. This smartphone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top. It also sports a reasonable 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’s BoostMaster fast-charging technology. The ZenFone Zoom will have support for up to 802.11ac WiFi and a single 4G LTE micro-SIM slot. Being a relatively premium device, the ZenFone Zoom will come in two colours — Ceramic White and Pure Black — at a retail price of RM2,099 and will be available at the end of January."

Sense  is now version 7 too with the ROM version listed as 6.14.707.1. Surely this is great news for  One M8  owners and paves the way for more OEMs to get  Marshmallow  and all the goodies that come along with. The Taiwanese company appears to be one of the first few manufacturers that have managed to get the latest version of  Android  up and running on their devices. Though we’re not sure what other models will receive the update as there’s no official statement from them yet. We received the tip from h_1_s that the HTC One M8 has received an OTA update earlier today; sharing with us the screenshot you’ll see after the break. To see whether your HTC has an updating waiting for you simply check manually by going to: Settings > About > Software The software update sizes in at 1.14GB and according to HTC, it’ll take an hour for the whole upgrading process to finish. Sense has been skimmed down a lot since its heavier days and the new update should probably further reduce the clutter – as promised by the twitter account of HTC USA – that  promised  those who bought  HTC’s A9  would receive Google SW updates within 15 days. Seems like their policy has in some way trickled down to their older devices as well with Marshmallow making its way down. If you need a refresher on what will be on Marshmallow, here’s some things you can expect: Do note that images shown below are from a  Nexus 6P , used as an example. App permissions Those using HTC devices can now individually give permissions to certain apps and remove them without rendering these apps useless. Now on Tap Users can now pull information based on contextual data on their screens. E.g. a text message containing a movie title, holding down your home button will allow you to bring up Google cards related to the movie. Doze Battery optimisation is finally here and HTC users will benefit vastly from it. Marshmallow will allow your devices to go into a deep(er) sleep than usual, saving a lot of battery in the process. Don’t expect Sense to look like a Vanilla carbon copy because they’ll definitely maintain some distinctive qualities.  Please share with us if you’ve managed to update your HTC devices, do let us know what model and be sure to pass along some screenshots too. We’d like to see how Sense 7 looks! Thanks to  @h_1_s  for the tip."
Rory Lee,Soon Google Maps can guess where you’re going and tell you how to get there faster,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/soon-google-maps-can-guess-where-youre-going-and-tell-you-how-to-get-there-faster/,"Driving Mode,google,Google Maps,Google Maps Driving Mode,Google Maps Driving Mode Malaysia,Google Maps Driving Mode update,Google Maps Malaysia,google maps navigation,Google Maps Update,Google Maps v9.19,navigation","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-13,"I’m sure that if you’ve travelled to work by car for some period of time, you would know most (if not all) of the logical routes to your office. The only reason we switch on navigation apps (like  Waze ) in the morning is to find out which is the least congested route, but doing so every morning, having to manually set your location each time can be rather cumbersome. So what if you don’t want to have to set your location each morning but still want to find out which is the least congested/fastest way to get to work on time?  Google Maps  has the answer. With the continuous development of Waze, it has become a fantastic navigation app and I personally use it over Google Maps, less because I feel that it is a better navigation app that Maps (which I don’t) and more because of its nifty, user-friendly features. Features like knowing where you’re going based on your history — for example, if you leave for work at 9 AM a few days in a row the app will suggest “work” the next time you fire it up at around the same time of day — as well as changing your route on the fly based on the changing traffic. That said, I do feel that the application updates the routes rather slowly (especially when it comes to congestion) and the navigation isn’t as crisp and informative as Google Maps’. Plus I really hate the way it looks and how slow it is to launch and calculate routes. With Google Maps v9.19 though, it seems that there is an alternative to that. With the acquisition of Waze by the search engine giant,  Google  has slowly integrated more and more of Waze’s features into their own navigation app. Now, along with a whole host of interesting new things, Google Maps has support for Driving Mode — but you’ll have to activate it first. Driving Mode isn’t what you think it means. It doesn’t convert your phone into a landscape screen that has gigantic buttons for doing simple tasks to like answering your phone calls so you won’t get distracted on the road. Instead, it guesses (based on your history) where you’re going and it gives you live updates on the traffic situation as well as the fastest routes to your destination, without the need for you to set a location beforehand. However, thanks to the comments section, users have pointed out that signing out and signing into Maps itself will trigger the feature and unlock the additional options. From there, simply hit “Add Driving shortcut” and you can access this awesome new feature. Once in you will be greeted with the new interface that shows you multicoloured roads (much like Waze) with different colours indicating different levels of congestion. You can then begin your journey or tap the screen once to bring down the menu and set your destination. Click to enlarge [ SOURCE ]"

Tech Sina sat down with  Lenovo ‘s Senior VP, Chen Xudong and the exec shared what’s to come for the bat-wing logoed brand. It doesn’t surprise us that the bridging of brands means that the Motorola profile will change to reflect the interest of Lenovo and Motorola – two brains in one head if you will – yet Lenovo will be the one wearing the pants in this relationship. He shared four big puzzle pieces and here they are: Those are some big bombs to drop so early in the year and comes during a recent period that has had many questions answered – the future of Motorola especially – which they clarified last week. Now we’ll share Android Authority’s analysis of what 2016 will mean for Moto devices. Biometric security The manufacturer has flirted with the idea before – on the  Nexus 6  – though they scrapped it towards the end. But it was once on the telco specific (AT&T) ATRIX 4G, albeit leaning towards Lenovo’s slide-type fingerprint sensors. We haven’t seen anything similar since then but since most smartphone makers are doing so, it’s time for Moto to do the same – it’ll even fit nicely in that rear dimple. Going bigger Based on their  statement  last week about “ Vibe ” and “ Moto ” devices, we could’ve seen this coming. Moto will occupy the higher end and from what we’ve seen in Motorola’s trend of devices getting bigger, it’s a clear no brainer.  No Moto Es will exist once they start marketing the two ranges differently with entry devices be relegated to the Vibe name . Promise of design based on market needs Motorola devices of this generation aren’t ugly, in fact, they look pretty good. The dimple is a matter of opinion but since Lenovo’s CEO has positive impressions on how they look, it shouldn’t warrant any big changes. Merging UIs We’re not too happy about this. These days people usually buy a Motorola because its UI is almost stock and whatever they add turns out to be actually useful. Do you want them to return to the MOTOBLUR days? Google did them a favour after purchasing them, please leave that alone – we beg of you. A bulky skin would mean longer delays for updates and they wouldn’t want that – surely irking existing users familiar with the current Moto. Final thoughts It’s likely that more information will be available as we’ve come to know that they like to contradict their older announcements with new ones. The next card they play will allow us to get a better picture of the whole 2016 master plan, we just hope the disruption is positive. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

The  LG G4  was one of the last remaining flagships to feature a removable battery and an expandable microSD slot. This is a trend that is slowly diminishing as brands are moving towards a fully enclosed design for a better look and feel.  The  LG G5  is said to be following  the same route  but new information suggests that they won’t be abandoning the needs of power users.  The folks at CNet Korea has posted a render of what the new flagship could look like. Instead of a curvy shape as seen on the G Flex and G4 models, the new G5 will have a flatter design with round edges. Another radical change is the volume rocker and power buttons are now purportedly moved towards the sides.  Despite having a full unibody design, the source also claims that the battery is still removable. How is this even possible? Apparently their engineers have made a mechanism that allows the bottom portion to be removed, giving you access to its battery. The lower end of the device will get a drawer-like design that helps to keep dust and water away.  When we think of a full unibody design with a removable battery, we thought of the old  HTC Legend  that was released about 6 years ago. It had a sturdy body made from a single block of aluminum and the removable cap at the bottom gives you access to its SIM, microSD and removable battery. This was the time when HTC was at its peak.  If the alleged LG G5 design is true, this is something interesting to look forward to next month. However, some LG fans might be disappointed if they are doing away with its signature rear-mounted volume and power buttons.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

You’ll also find 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and charge through microUSB. Moving to the middle child, this smartphone has slightly bigger 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution Super AMOLED screen. Similarly, the processor gets upped to an Octa-core 1.6GHz processor coupled with 2GB of RAM and the same 16GB of internal storage (still expandable). Keeping it powered will be a 2,900 mAh battery that has fast charging abilities. Connectivity options get an upgrade too with Cat 6 LTE capabilities in its Dual-SIM slots. It’ll have the same WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC features and the charging port is still microUSB. But at this price point, the home button will act as a fingerprint scanner. On the top of the A series is the Galaxy A7 and deservingly so with its bigger 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution Super AMOLED panel. Oddly, the Octa-core processor is still clocked to 1.6GHz but gets its RAM bumped up to 3GB. Internal storage again stays the same at 16GB but you’ll have that microSD slot if you want to expand it up to 128GB. This device also has Dual-SIM capabilities and the same connectivity options as the A5. But the battery is a larger 3,300 mAh cell to make up for the larger screen, still with fast charging. The Galaxy A7 also has a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay. It’s refreshing to see that a big name like Samsung is starting to adjust itself to markets but in a market that requires you to adapt or perish, that makes a whole lot of sense. Only thing the specs of the three devices don’t seem to match up to their competition in respective brackets. In spite of that, could you see yourself owning any of the Galaxy A series devices? Or are you going to splash a more money on the anticipated  Galaxy S7(s)  that are to arrive after  MWC 2016 ? Do let us know in the comments below!"
Rory Lee,"Lenovo just launched a new budget smartphone and trust us, it’s no lemon",http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/14/lenovo-lemon-3-budget-smartphone/,"Android,budget smartphone,Lemon 3,Lemon 3 launch,Lenovo Lemon 3,Lenovo Lemon 3 budget,Lenovo Lemon 3 launch,Redmi 3,Redmi 3 killer,smart phone,smartphone,Xiaomi Redmi 3","Android,Industry in General,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-14,"The budget end of the smartphone market is no longer a place for plasticky afterthoughts, as manufacturers realise that to appeal to the budget buyer — of which there are many — you can’t make the device feel like its price. When  Xiaomi   announced  the RMB699 (around RM467)  Redmi 3 , it  blew the minds of everyone here  at the office with its metal body and mid-tier Snapdragon 616 processor, not to mention the 13MP PDAF rear camera plus its massive 4,100 mAh battery. We thought that nobody would be able to hold a candle to it, much less challenge it. Well, we were wrong because  Lenovo  came out of nowhere and swung a left hook right in the Redmi 3’s face with their new budget smartphone. Affectionately named the Lemon 3, Lenovo’s new device sports a 5-inch 1080p full HD display — which is one up over the Redmi 3’s measly 720p HD panel. On the inside, it is powered by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon 616 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. In terms of camera, the Lenovo Lemon 3 packs a 13-megapixel rear sensor and 5MP front camera combo.  It also supports 4G LTE and dual-SIM functionality plus a 2,750 mAh battery all encased in a metallic body. Hoping to one-up other budget phones (as if it hasn’t already), the smartphone will have a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers. The only unfortunate thing is that they’re rear facing, instead of front facing like their  Vibe K4 Note  that they  announced earlier . Then again, for the price of RMB699 (around RM467) we can’t really complain. Also, since it’s priced at that sweet spot of RMB699, Lenovo couldn’t have made it more obvious that this Lemon 3 was designed to slay the Redmi 3. Odd isn’t it that we’ve arrived at a point in time where there is such a thing as a “budget flagship” killer. All the better for consumers, though! The way we see it, your options are clear. Do you want a better screen plus a better set of speakers for a smaller battery, or do you want a massive battery with compromises in the other two departments. With that laser etched lattice-diamond-design-thing, we will give the Redmi 3 a slight edge for now in terms of build, but we’ll have to hold them both before we make a decision. Currently, there is no information on availability outside of China, but we will keep you posted if there are any updates. For now, do let us know what you think of this device and if you would get it over the Redmi 3 in the comments section below. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ,  3 ]"

The latest Redmi Note 3 Pro that runs a Qualcomm processor, instead of a MediaTek chipset – that’s not all either, they’ve upgraded the internals as well. The Redmi Note 3 Pro maintains the form factor and metal make but swaps out the MediaTek Helio X10 SoC for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 (previously named the Snapdragon 618). Click to for a large image Its new Hexa-core 64-bit processor is clocked at 1.8GHz coupled with an Adreno 510 GPU and allows the Redmi Note 3 Pro to support faster LTE speeds (Cat.7) and depending on telcos, it has future-proof support for VoLTE (Voice over LTE) too. The following video demonstrates the differences of VoLTE and regular call quality: Our full post on VoLTE is available  here . Xiaomi ups the camera credentials of the Redmi Note 3 Pro by adding a 16-megapixel rear sensor that has an aperture of f/2.0 and PDAF (Phase detection autofocus). Bettering the non-Pro version by 3-megapixels. On the front, you’ll still find the 5-megapixel camera. Otherwise, it maintains the same spec sheet as the Redmi Note 3, keeping the sleek metal and fingerprint sensor on the Pro. Here’s a recap if you missed out; the smartphone will carry a 5.5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution display, in two different RAM/internal storage options: 2GB/16GB or 3GB/32GB. When deciding to purchase the device, keep in mind that Xiaomi still left out a microSD slot so choose the 3GB/32GB version if you have the cash.  MIUI forum states that on AnTuTu’s most recent Benchmark 6.0 it registered a score of 77,592. A respectable score for a mid-range device. Those in India could see the Redmi Note 3 Pro arrive in their market soon enough, with Xiaomi starting a Redmi Note 3 Explore challenge in the country. Allowing 100 lucky fans a chance of winning the device if they manage to complete 100 missions. As for the Chinese market, the 2GB/16GB model will go for 999 Yuan (RM 665). Pricing for the 3GB/32GB model is expected at a later date. The battery cell is rated at 4,050 mAh and you’ll be getting MIUI 7 out of the box. Now we’d like to know, given the choice if the only difference was the processor inside the Redmi Note 3, which would you prefer? The Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor or the MediaTek Helio X10 SoC.

Alexander Wong,5 reasons why the Redmi 3 is a compelling smartphone under RM600,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/why-xiaomi-redmi-3-is-the-best-phone-under-rm600/,,,2016-01-13,"Xiaomi has built a reputation of making super affordable phones with top notch specs. In an effort to dispel its “cheap” image, the Chinese smartphone maker is adding a touch of luxury by switching from plastic to metal in their latest models. The bigger  Redmi Note 3  came as a surprise, launching just months after it unveiled the  Redmi Note 2 .  With more competition jumping into the affordable segment, Xiaomi aims to defend its spot with its latest  Redmi 3  (not to be confused with the Redmi Note 3). Looking at the spec sheet alone, you’ll be amazed that this will be their cheapest phone for 2016. The hardware is a class above and the build of the phone is something you wouldn’t expect at bargain basement price.  Here are 5 reasons why this is the best smartphone to get for less than RM600.  The Redmi 3 packs a massive 4,100mAh capacity battery and that’s unheard of for an entry-level device. In fact, it is the biggest they have ever fitted on a Xiaomi smartphone. As comparison, its larger brother, the Redmi Note 2 has a 3,060mAh capacity while the latest Redmi Note 3 packs a 4,000mAh unit. On paper, this should give you an all day battery life and you won’t need to lug a power bank around for most users."
Rory Lee,Now you can have a phone that you can’t afford to match that Bentley you don’t own,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/now-you-can-have-a-phone-that-you-cant-afford-to-match-that-bentley-you-dont-own/,"Android,Bentley Android phone,Bentley phone,bentley smartphone,smart phone,smartphone,Vertu,Vertu Bentley phone,Vertu Bently Android phone,Vertu Signature Touch,Viertu Signature Touch for Bentley","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Vertu",2016-01-12,"Have you seen any “car enthusiasts” lately? Fascinating people who talk about the chassis, drive and power-to-weight ratios of the Ferraris and Lamborghinis that they don’t own, all decked out in their respective car-branded gear. They say that the easiest way to spot that a person does not drive a Ferrari is to look for the guy wearing the Ferrari branded sunglasses/shirt. And since there are many more people who don’t own luxury cars versus people who do, car branded accessories are popping up everywhere. What’s worse is that these “accessories” are usually just overpriced versions of otherwise normal products. Slap a Rolls Royce logo on a microwave and it will probably be worth 10 times more. Bentley has the same idea, and working with luxury phone manufacturer  Vertu , they’ve smacked a Bentley badge on a USD9,900 (around RM43,600) phone to create the Vertu Signature Touch for Bentley. My bank account isn’t ready for this. Vertu is renown for being the manufacturer of ultra-premium phones that usually prioritise form over function. But with their latest device, the Signature Touch, they’ve managed to combine the two aspects as it packs an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of internal storage under that pretty stitched exterior. The Signature Touch also has a 5.2″ 1080p full HD display with sapphire crystal glass. It also sports a 21MP rear shooter with PDAF for their rear camera while the front will have a 2.1MP selfie camera. Powering the device is a 3,100 mAh battery. So what’s the difference between this Signature Touch for Bentley versus the regular Signature Touch? Well, it has a 3D Bentley logo; two-tone Beluga and Hotspur Bentley leather with Hotspur stitching. Besides that, the Signature Touch for Bentley also features knurled side keys, a “unique” pillow rail and sound bar. I know right? Try explaining why this phone is special  without  sounding pretentious. Other than the potentially absurd price tag, there really is nothing too special about this smartphone that makes it a better phone than a similar flagship. It even runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. I honestly think it looks really ugly, unnecessarily tacky and frankly quite  ah beng  (there is really no English word for  ah beng ) too. I’d like to say that this automobile-branded-regular-product-fad has gone on for way too long and things are getting out of control so we should all refrain from buying them. But, I know that somewhere out there, there is a guy sitting in his million ringgit car thinking: “Hmm, if only I had a smartphone that costs about the same as a Myvi to match my Bentley…”.

As  teased  previously, the  OPPO F  series is their new mid-range smartphone lineup that promises premium photography  at a reasonable price.  In terms of appearance, it looks like an improved version of its  OPPO R7 series  with some minor tweaks on the unibody metal design. It resembles closely with the R7 Lite and it gets a couple of upgrades in the hardware department. At the front, the OPPO F1 gets a compact-sized 5″ display that does a HD 720 resolution of 1280×720. Powering the processor is an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 Octa-Core unit, similar to the newly announced  Redmi 3 , and it gets 3GB of RAM for all your multi-tasking needs. On-board there’s 16GB of storage which can be expanded to 128GB extra with microSD. This is a Dual-SIM device that accepts a MicroSIM and Nano-SIM, but you would lose a slot if you need to use a microSD card.  For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and it is assisted with a single LED flash. Meanwhile, the front gets an 8MP f/2.0 shooter with built-on beautification features for the perfect selfie. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh battery which is slightly more than the OPPO R7 Lite and R7 models. Out of the box, the F1 runs on ColorOS 2.1 that’s based on Android 5.1 Lollipop.  In Vietnam, the OPPO F1 is priced at 6,490,000 Dong, which is about RM1,270 if converted directly. As an earlybird bonus, the first 1,500 buyers will get a pair of iLike Bluetooth headset thrown in for free. The OPPO F1 is now available in Gold and we expect them to release a Rose Gold version later on. With Malaysia as a key market, they are likely to release the OPPO F1 here very soon.

Alexander Wong,Using iPad or iPhone during bedtime? iOS 9.3 will help you sleep better,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/using-ipad-or-iphone-during-bedtime-ios-9-3-will-help-you-sleep-better/,"iOS 9,iOS 9.3,iOS 9.3 Update,iPad,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Plus,Low Blue Light Mode,Night Shift,Reading Mode","Apple,iOS,iPad,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-12,"Several studies have shown that using your smartphones and tablet during bedtime could affect your quality of sleep. This is due to blue light emitted from digital screens that can cause eye fatigue. This could even cause  eyesight impairment  in the long run. With the upcoming iOS 9.3 update for the iPhone and iPad, Apple wants you to sleep better at night with its new “Night Shift” feature.  According to Apple, Night Shift aims to make it easier for you to sleep by making the display more pleasant to your eyes. Using your device’s time and GPS, it will know when it is sunset and would gradually change the display to show warmer colours, cutting down on blue light emission. As a result, it would help to increase  melatonin production  naturally, a vital component to get better sleep at night.  Of course, this isn’t entirely new. Most smartphones from China including Xiaomi, OPPO, Huawei and BenQ have their own low blue light or reading mode that does the same thing. The only difference is that Apple is making it automatic based on your current time.  There’s no mention if there’s an option to turn it off, but we are sure it would be important for those actually working night shifts.  Apart from this low blue light mode, the new iOS 9.3 update will also introduce a multi-user feature for the iPad. This would allow several people to share a single device and the experience will be customised based on their individual profiles. Unfortunately, this appears to be catered for schools and we are not sure if they would extend this to end users as well. On top of that, the native Notes app can be secured with your fingerprints. So you can keep your private info safe and unlock them with a single tap.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Similar to Samsung’s tradition, LG is avoiding the busy MWC announcement week by holding the event a day earlier on 21st February.  Could this be their new  LG G5  flagship? The invitation doesn’t show much except for a “Jack in a box” and a caption “Play Begins”. This suggests that it could be a multimedia or a gaming powerhouse. Perhaps a new smartphone with front facing speakers? We can only hope. Their last flagship device, the  LG V10  is quite an  impressive smartphone  with dual screens and dual front facing cameras.   For the new LG G5, speculations have pointed towards a  unibody metal design , which means there probably won’t be a removable battery and microSD slot. The screen is purported to be a more compact 5.3 incher with Quad HD resolution and it is likely to run on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM.  The secondary “ticker” display could be carried over to this new G5 flagship and the rear might come with a dual camera setup for extra depth of field features. It was also rumoured that LG might introduce a new  MagicSlot  that allow expansion of additional accessories. You can read up more on what to expect over  here . Nevertheless, we expect to see more leaks in the coming weeks leading up to the main event. Can LG beat Samsung in the flagship game this year? We’ll find out next month.  [  SOURCE  ]"
Rory Lee,Upgrade your Windows 8 device or be exposed to security risks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/13/upgrade-your-windows-8-device-or-be-exposed-to-security-risks/,"IE,Internet Explorer,microsoft,Microsoft Edge,Microsoft Internet Explorer,Microsoft stops support for Internet Explorer,Microsoft stops support for Windows 8,Microsoft Windows 10,Microsoft Windows 7,Microsoft Windows 8,No support for Windows 8,Windows 8.1","Industry in General,Windows 10",2016-01-13,"As with all old software,  Microsoft  is terminating support for  Windows 8 , as well as older versions of its Internet Explorer (IE) web browser — IE 8, IE 9 and IE 10. This is to facilitate the push towards Microsoft’s new operating system,  Windows 10 . When we say terminate, we don’t mean that your Windows 8 machine will just up and die or stop working straight away, it’s just that Windows 8 won’t receive updates, security fixes and bug fixes it used to get. If you are running on Windows 8 though, don’t worry because there is a simple way around this issue. Besides the obvious upgrade to Windows 10 being one of the solutions, Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1, which based on their lifecycle fact sheet, will continue to receive updates for two more years until January 9, 2018. If you’ve read the horror stories of Windows 10’s ominous privacy terms and want to avoid such dangers by staying on an older version of Windows, you can now do so. As you can see, today also marks the end of Windows 7 service Pack 1’s mainstream support — but don’t worry you will still continue to receive security updates as extended support will go all the way to January 14, 2020. All you lose is the mainstream support which includes free incident support, warranty claims and fixes for non-security and security bugs, plus design changes and feature requests. Based on statistics published by Tech Crunch, 2-3% of PCs (30-40 million devices) are still running on Windows 8, while Windows 7 is said to currently be in use on  56.26% of global PCs . Why is it important to keep your system updated and within Microsoft’s support lifecycle? Well, the first and most obvious reason is security. As operating systems lose their security updates, they become vulnerable to new malware and potential attacks, which puts your information as well as your system at risk. Microsoft, via updates, patches these new vulnerabilities when they come up so that these exploitable holes are fixed. Once that support ends, you lose all protection against future vulnerabilities. Besides Windows 8, Microsoft is also terminating support for older versions of IE, urging users to upgrade either to IE 11 or Microsoft’s new Edge browser. I’ve personally never been a fan of IE because of how messy the interface is and how clunky it makes browsing feel, so it comes as a surprise to me that 20% of the desktop web browser market still uses the older versions of IE (8, 9, 10) as their daily driver. Unfortunately for those people, they will have to migrate to either the new IE 11, Microsoft Edge, or other third party browsers like  Chrome  or  Firefox , or else they would be facing security vulnerabilities when browsing the web. Microsoft Edge, the built-in browser on Windows 10, promised much in terms of functionality and performance. Things like extensions were supposed to come to Edge to keep it up to par with browsers like Google’s Chrome but til this day, there is still  no sign of those extensions  anywhere. I don’t know about you guys but I definitely need my extensions. Killing off old software is nothing new, and I welcome it because not only does it allow software developers to focus on their latest and greatest product, it also allows them to free up valuable resources to focus on new projects. Resources that would otherwise go to updating and patching old software can now be redirected towards either new software or the improvement of current software. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  IMAGE SOURCE ]"

If you’re  looking for a smartwatch , you might want to wait for what’s coming up next. The  ASUS ZenWatch 2  was spotted recently on SIRIM. In most cases, if a device gets the certification green light, we can expect it to hit the Malaysian market very soon.  Announced  middle of last year , the ZenWatch 2 is their 2nd generation smart watch that runs on Android Wear. To suit different wrists, it will come in two display sizes – 1.63″ and 1.45″. The front uses Super AMOLED display pushing a modest 280×280 pixels resolution and it is protected by a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It is also water resistant with IP67 rating and the case is made of durable stainless steel.  In terms of design, it looks quite similar to its first ZenWatch but it gets an extra button at the sides that’s designed to look like a crown. The ZenWatch 2 comes in an array of case colours and straps of various materials. For a touch of exclusivity, there’s even a Swarovski edition strap with studded cyrstals.  As it uses Android Wear, you get access of apps, watchfaces and you can customised your own design with the ASUS FaceDesigner app. Charging the ZenWatch 2 is done via a magnetic cable that snaps underneath the watch case. According to ASUS, you can get a 50% charge to its 300mAh battery in just 36 minutes. If you need to charge on a go, there’s an optional chargeback accessory that functions as a powerbank for your watch. The obvious omission is a heart rate sensor which was included in the  first version .  Since the ZenWatch 2 is certified along with the Zenfone Zoom, there’s a chance that it could be announced today. Follow us on  Twitter  and  Facebook  for the latest updates.

We’ve already seen devices that give us psychic abilities, keep us safe, and help us hear better. The future looks great and these wearables will enable us to do things we never thought possible.  But what about our feelings? Our mental state and emotional wellbeing? While slaving away trying to create a technologically able world have we forgotten a key aspect of living? Our happiness. A wearable from Sentio Solutions wants to refocus efforts and tackle our feelings. They (and I quote) want you to “Own your emotions. Hack happiness”. We all deserve to be happy after all. Mood rings were a big fad back in the 70s and it has taken four decades before we this company realised that the 70s weren’t all about afros and protests; to them, it was about emotional intelligence or EQ.  If you haven’t heard of emotional intelligence, it’s basically our ability (or lack thereof) to understand and recognise emotions, allowing us to differentiate and label what we feel, before using it to think and behave appropriately. Back to the present, Feel will be today’s technological equivalent of the mood-ring. Much like other wearables, it’ll connect to your smartphone through Bluetooth and via the companion app, you’ll get real-time stats on your current emotional state. Four sensors inside the wristband allow Feel to measure and track skin temperature, blood volume pulse and galvanic skin response (tracking sweat through your skin). A whole load of gibberish to us but we’ll just nod for the name of science. The wearable looks like an adjustable rubber bracelet with sensors along its sleek surface. It’ll collect biometric readings coupled with movement tracking to gauge activity levels; then on, it’ll gather the data and illustrate it in the form of a cool graph. Looking at the visualisation, you’ll get to see when your stress levels peaked and what your moods were like throughout the day. It’ll all be personalised too, in their wellness programme that (hopefully) will allow you to be happier and constantly stay focused towards your emotional goals. Feel and its app will work hand in hand to give suggestions on how users can mediate stress and improve overall emotions – that’ll include breathing and meditation based exercises to bring you back to Earth. The app will also recommend you to “laugh more” or blow off some steam by exercising. CEO George Eleftheriou shared with Mashable that the wristband will be really helpful while battling traffic; snapping the user out of their rage by vibrating suddenly on their wrist. He claims that vibration will help calm the user – we’re not sure if this was backed by science. Those interested can expect Feel to go on pre-order in Spring 2016, with an estimated shipping and store availability in December. The wearable will come in four colours: White, Black, Turquoise and fire Red. Once in stores, it’ll go for US$ 199 (RM 872.44) but during the pre-order period, it’ll cost US$ 149 (RM 654.27).

CEO Sundar Pichai announces that  Google ’s next  Innovation in the Open  event will be delivered on May 18th till the 20th and be held at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View (Google HQ). Taking to Google+, Pichai mentions that their decision to hold the developer event at the place that started it all off to mark the 10th anniversary of the gathering. And you can bet the 10th conference will have some great innovations to put on stage. 
 We’re expecting to take a peek at the latest version of  Android : 7.0 or N as that was the case in the past two I/Os. Running up to the possible announcement, we discussed the potential names and what the CEO had to say about his mum helping name the upcoming version of Android  before . And we’re hoping it’ll be Nutella. That and the fact that  split-screen  should natively be supported on  N  soon – for now, that’s all we have on what’s to be available on  Android N  but moving closer to May, we’ll have our fingers crossed to see more nibbles left by Google devs. During the keynote, there’s also bound to be new developments in VR,  Android Wear , Project Tango, and other things that the company has been busy with. Anything that Google has to announce is surely going make waves and you can be sure we’ll be watching the live stream attentively when May rolls around. Let us know what you guys think? What other works could Google possibly announce? Drop us a comment below and share with us your thoughts. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  IMAGE SOURCE ,  2  ]"
Rory Lee,Xiaomi’s Mi 5 could come in both metal and glass variants,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/12/xiaomis-mi-5-could-come-in-both-metal-and-glass-variants/,"Android,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Mi 5,Xiaomi Mi 5 2 variant,Xiaomi Mi 5 glass,Xiaomi Mi 5 metal,Xiaomi Mi 5 rumour,Xiaomi Mi 5 two variants,Xiaomi Mi 5 variant","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Xiaomi",2016-01-12,"A few days ago we reported on some leaked images of what looked like the finished product of  Xiaomi ‘s upcoming flagship the  Mi 5 . The images gave us a look at the front of the device but we never got to see the back of it. Now, information has surfaced that suggests the new flagship device could feature two different variants sporting different specs and different back panels. Xiaomi is no stranger to bold choices when it comes to their products. Look at their  Redmi Note  series where the  Redmi Note 2  and the  Redmi Note 3  were wildly different — one had a full metal body and a fingerprint scanner — yet they were both launched only two months apart. Would it really surprise you then that they would do something as radical as having two different back panel/constructions on their upcoming flagship device? Well if it comes true that will definitely still surprise me. Of the two devices, the first one is purported to have curved 2.5D glass at the front and the back of the device with a metal frame. Think  Samsung Galaxy S6  or  Galaxy Note5 . This variant is also supposed to feature a 1080p full HD resolution display with the possibility of having 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. On the other hand, the supposed second phone is said to feature an all-metal design — that means full-metal rear housing instead of curved 2.5D glass. Additionally, the device is said to have a higher QHD 2K resolution display and it could possibly house the 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage variant. Other than that, both devices should be identical — sporting a Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and a 16MP/13MP camera combo with a suggested screen size that can range from 5 to 5.2-inches. The smartphone is also said to have a 3,600 mAh battery and become official by January 21, though sales are only expected to start on February 8. Of course, this is all just guess work based on rumours at this point and for all we know it could be the other way around. That said, this isn’t the first time Xiaomi have done two versions of the same device as the  Mi Note  and  Mi Note Pro  are essentially the same device except for the fact that the Pro variant has a more powerful processor plus more RAM and a higher resolution screen. If these rumours of the Mi 5 are true though, it would be the first time that the Chinese company have gone with two completely different back constructions on a phone. So, take this with a grain of salt. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"
Rory Lee,Xiaomi officially reveals the all-metal Redmi 3,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/xiaomi-officially-reveals-the-all-metal-redmi-3/,"Android,budget smartphone,Redmi 3,Redmi 3 launch,Redmi 3 official,smart phone,smartphone,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Redmi 3,Xiaomi Redmi 3 launch","Mobile Devices,Xiaomi",2016-01-11,"Xiaomi  have officially unveiled their Redmi lineup of budget smartphones, the  Redmi 3 . Sporting a metal unibody and a massive 4,100 mAh battery, the device looks be a strong contender in the budget end of the smartphone market. The device will feature a 5″ 720p HD display with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage running MIUI 7 out of the box. That’s bordering on mid-range territory. It will also have a hybrid SIM setup where users can choose to either run dual SIM or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB) for more storage. One of its strongest selling points is the massive 4,100 mAh battery which Xiaomi says will give you an 80% improvement in talk time duration compared to its predecessor. Despite all that extra battery capacity though, it is thinner than the Redmi 2, coming in at just 8.5mm and weighing only 144g. Besides that the battery also supports 5V/2A fast charging so you can top it up in a jiffy. All of the internals will be housed inside a full-metal body — a first for the Redmi line — that has an all-new lattice design made up of 4,166 stars woven together to reflect an arrangement of diamonds. From the images, it certainly looks pretty good. Camera wise, the device will sport a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear shooter with phase detection autofocus (PDAF) which Xiaomi quotes will give you a fast autofocus time of 0.1 seconds. Selfies, on the other hand, will be taken care of by a 5MP f/2.2 snapper at the front. The Redmi 3 will be available in three fashion colours — fashion gold, fashion silver and fashion grey — plus a classic gold colour and will be priced at RMB699 (around RM470), which is the  same price in RMB  as the Redmi 2 before it. It will go on sale in China tomorrow (12 January 2016) on  Mi.com  and  Tmall . The device is already on display at Mi.com’s  product page . We do hope that this device will come to Malaysia within the next few months which has been the trend for Xiaomi devices. Perhaps this will come with it’s bigger brother the  Redmi Note 3 ? What do you think of this all-metal budget device?"

And the only thing stopping it is well… you know what. Anyway, while it still hasn’t been considered illegal in some states in Malaysia, let’s take a look at the one and only “hookah-like” smartphone. Phubbers who love vaping can now finally put two and two together, making the Vaporcade Jupiter a novelty that’s worth trying – the Verge seems to think so at least when they tried it out at CES 2016.  This takes the cake in a time that has most smartphone manufacturers adding features likes fingerprint sensors, dual-cameras, and even ticker displays. But you can be sure that they won’t even consider adding vape modules to their devices. Vaporcade wants to go against the grain and fit the niche that they’ve created – cellular vaping. Their first smartphone is called the Jupiter IO 3: a 3G device goes for US$ 299 (RM 1317.11). The smartphone in question will run Android KitKat 4.4 – dated but then again you’re buying it to vape not to have the best smartphone. It’ll run for 16 hours (smartphone only) with its two batteries – that’s shared to power both the phone and vape. Vaporcade intends to release a 4G model as well but that’s yet to be announced. Bear in mind the amount stated above doesn’t include the “Shuttle” – a pop on module that attaches on the top of the smartphone – those cost US$ 14.99 (RM 66.07). Vaporcade claims that the device has already passed FCC certification but we’ll have to see what hurdles they have to jump if you’re ever expected to find the Jupiter in Malaysia. We don’t condone harming your body and the effects of vaping are still up in the air but it’s crazy to think they managed to put this on a smartphone.

Rory Lee,The next iPhone won’t have a headphone jack and here’s why that sucks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/the-next-iphone-wont-have-a-headphone-jack-and-heres-why-that-sucks/,"AirPods,apple,Apple AirPods,Apple EarPods,Apple headphones,Apple iPhone 7,Apple wireless earphones,Apple wireless headphones,Beats,Beats by Dre,EarPods,iPhone 7 no 3.5mm jack,iPhone 7 rumour,iPhone 7 waterproof,smart phone,smartphone,wireless EarPods","Apple,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2016-01-11,"The iPhone has been the forefront of many technological innovations, although some of which were closer to popularisations than actual inventions. Then again nothing is truly invented until  Apple  does it right?  Now it seems that Apple is “reinventing” the smartphone by removing the headphone jack.  Whether they actually choose to label it as such remains to be seen, but this bold design choice by the Cupertino company doesn’t seem to be going down well with at least  200,000 of their loyal fanbase . Well, to pacify the angry mob, Apple’s got the AirPods for you — at least we think that’s what they’re going to be called. 
 Motorola Hint Based on 9to5Mac’s article, the AirPods looks to be exactly what the name suggests — “air” versions of Apple’s  EarPods  — completely wireless earbud headphones. Likely bearing a physical resemblance to the Motorola Hint, these new headphones are co-developed with Beats Electronics (which Apple acquired awhile back) and are designed to be compatible with the new  iPhone 7  that is rumoured to be ditching the 3.5mm jack altogether. That’s not to say the EarPods will just die off, no, the wired EarPods are expected to be connected via the Lightning connector, a feature that has been included in iOS since 2014. The AirPods on the other hand, are expected to be sold separately as a premium upgrade to the wired in-ear headphones. 9to5Mac also suspects that these earbud headphones will feature a noise-cancelling microphone system for phone  calls and communication with Siri even without Apple’s in-line microphone and remote. It would make sense, after all, they’re supposed to be built for a phone so it wouldn’t make much sense if you couldn’t make calls on them. These AirPods are suspected to come with a carrying case that will charge your wireless headphones when you’re not using them. Without which 9to5Mac estimates the headphones’ battery life at just under 4 hours on a single charge. These AirPods could also be port-less requiring you to charge them in that case. Ditching the 3.5mm jack is nothing new in the mobile phone industry, even Oppo has done it with their uber-thin R5. While Apple’s decision could be driven by the fact that they want to make the iPhone 7 thinner, it could also be because — with all these waterproof iPhone rumours floating about — having a 3.5mm jack would mean another headache when trying to make the device waterproof. When the original iPhone came out right until the iPhone 4s, the headphone jack was located at the top of the device. Since the iPhone 5’s inception, however, the 3.5mm jack has transferred to the bottom, a trend that has carried on even to the iPhone 6s of today. Apple isn’t a stranger to changing things up with their line of products; removing the optical drives from most of their computer devices was one move, changing the headphone jack placements is another. When they made the first move on the iPhone 5, it was because it apparently made more sense to have all your cables sticking out on one end of the device. People were also more inclined to placing their devices head first into their pockets — something I agree with. With their upcoming iPhone 7, Apple is looking to mix things up even more — design wise — with a  waterproof body made out of a “new material”  and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting instead to stick with either a Lightning port or a wireless Bluetooth solution. The thing is, wireless devices run on battery, and if you’re already charging your smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, tablet and over-ear headphones, do you really want to charge your earbuds too? The worst part? Having to charge your earbuds are just the tip of the iceberg. At first, Apple locks you within their app ecosystem. Then they don’t allow you to use third-party ports and connectors. Now, they don’t even want you to use third-party headphones, forcing you to stick with their proprietary ones. What about those of us who have bought a solid set of headphones with a 3.5mm jack? Are we forced to use an adapter? Apple has always made some beautiful devices, with gorgeous fit and finishes, but ever since they launched their rendition of a  battery case , we’re a little worried about the new iPhone. Maybe the  Smart Battery Case  was a dud, the ugly apple pie you hide from your guests when they come over for dinner. A lazy oversight. For Apple’s sake, we sure hope so. [ SOURCE ]"

To recap, the honor band z1 is an affordable circular smartwatch that comes with a black and white OLED display. It is thinner than most smartwatches and it can last 3 days on a single charge. With a metallic frame and a rubber sports band, the band z1 is also water and dust resistant with IP68 rating. There are no physical buttons and the band is operated from its touch sensitive display. Compared to other smartwatches, the features are quite basic but it still offers fitness tracking capabilities including activity and sleep monitoring. Apart from being able to tell the time, it can be used for notification alerts for your calls, SMS and email.  When it was announced for the European market, the band is priced at 79 Euros, which is about RM380.

Thus lies the subjectivity of it all but when you have a majority of people who feel that your attempt is a half-hearted one, prepare for the worse – especially when a fan releases a concept and it makes your (in this case Microsoft/Windows) UI look silly. Refining Windows 10 Mobile by tackling its flaws, the concept takes a full swipe at what Microsoft outed. Redesigning the action centre, start screen and Windows 10 Store, designer Jobs Robson makes Windows look nice again. Changing out those bland coloured tiles for a more uniformed frosted glass effect to the operating system, Robson uses familiar elements that were found much earlier on Windows 7 and now seen again on desktop-based Windows systems. Utilising spacing better on Windows 10 Mobile devices, he makes some apps freely transform based on unallocated space on screens. People in the comment sections have gone off on Microsoft, saying that it’s shameful that their own designers aren’t capable of putting something like this out. Adding that Jobson should be hired and allowed to actually put this concept to work. While their Surface line has been relatively successful, their mobile division has lacked some gusto. We felt that the latest  Lumia 950 s, were boring and there was a high drop in quality in terms of the polycarbonate case. Apps were slow and the OS was buggy when switching between apps and menus. Our full rundown of the Lumia 950 and 950 XL can be found  here . Microsoft has even delayed Windows 10 Mobile on older devices, pointing us to think that they’ve dropped the ball on the operating system. This concept could offer a lending hand but only in terms of looks, they still have a lot to do in terms of optimisation and functionality. I for one think that (this) Jobs deserves a cookie. There would be a high possibility that a Windows phone would be in my pocket if the UI looked like this. You can check out his other work  here .

While there were some who liked it, everyone in our office was not impressed with their “flagship”. It was a little sluggish and for a device rated so highly on DxOMark, we were quite disappointed with the camera. With a device that left much to be desired and a quiet CES 2016 showing, Sony fans must be hungry for something cool to come out of the tech giant. Well, we don’t have their new flagship for you, but here’s a pretty pink-gold (rose gold? It could just be gold with bad white balance/me being a little colour blind) Sony device. It appears all of Sony’s quietness hasn’t stopped someone from leaking what looks to be the Xperia C6 — sporting a sexy rounded bezel-less design with Sony’s trademark camera-shutter-esque power button. If you’ve been paying attention to futuristic sci-fi movies, you’ll know that bezel-less is the way to go and we were glad Sony are going one step further from the near bezel-less display that appeared on the  Sony Xperia C5 Ultra  from last year. That said, this doesn’t look like a C6 Ultra simply because it looks relatively small in what we’re assuming is the leakster’s hands. Unless of course he/she has gargantuan hands. Either way, if we look at the device’s designs, the good looks we’ve grown accustomed to in a Sony device are all mostly apparent with that thin body and the familiar shape. The edges are rounded like the Xperia C5 Ultra which should make it nicer to hold than the Xperia Z5 though it does seem that the device still has a flat back. There is also a distinct lack of front-facing speakers (aw man) despite all that chin and forehead sony are giving it. What’s a little unnerving is that the back panel of this device seems to be peeling off — which we hope won’t be a problem on the finished product. Sony devices have had pretty good build quality after all. The Xperia C6 is rumoured to sport a 5.5″ full HD display up front, with a 2.0GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor running on the inside. Besides that, there isn’t much information left about the device itself. I guess we’ll have to wait for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year to (hopefully) find out more. Since it’s pink though, it could potentially tie in with an upcoming pink Sony device that the company has been endlessly teasing on their  Instagram account , With, nine images teased thus far, this device’s reveal has been set for 12 January 2016 and the folks over at Xperia Blog reckon it isn’t a pink Xperia Z5.

This joins its current colours of Black, White, Gold and Green, and we are glad Sony Mobile isn’t calling it Rose Gold.  Under the hood, the pink colour Xperia Z5 has the same specs as the existing models. The front gets a 5.2″ Full HD screen that’s flanked by a pair of stereo speakers. Under the hood, it gets an Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and it comes with 32GB of on-board storage. It still accepts external expansion via microSD up to 200GB. The home button now is flush with its metal frame and it also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner.  For imaging, it packs its newest 23MP f/2.0 camera with PDAF which claims to be the best camera on a smartphone as rated by  DXOmark . When we  compared its camera to other flagships , it doesn’t seem to be the case but it  performs spectacularly well  in videos despite not having an Optical Image Stabiliser. The Xperia Z5 shoot videos up to 4K with Steadyshot and it is further enhanced by Intelligent Active mode. For selfies it gets a front-facing 5.1MP shooter that supports HDR and Full HD videos.  Powering the device is a 2,900mAh capacity battery which is rated to last up to 2 days on a single charge. Like its previous Xperia Z series, it is also water and dust resistant with IP68 even with its new cap-less microUSB design. According to the lead designer, picking a new colour for the Xperia Z5 is a detailed process on its on. Apparently it is a challenge to find the right shade of pink that would work well with its frosted glass and aluminium frame. They researched various sources from Sakura cherry blossom to the colours of the sky during a sunset. As a result, they finally settled on a light dusky pink that complements its current Xperia Z5 colour palette.  Is this the pink phone worth waiting for? [  SOURCE  ]"

If you’re wealthy enough to splurge on multiple Apple Watches, switching from one watch to another can be a pain in the butt. Not too worry as the Cupertino company understands what Apple Watch aficionados have to go through and here’s what you can expect with the upcoming watchOS 2.2.  With the new software update, users would be able to pair more than one Apple Watch on the same iPhone. This gives you the opportunity to connect an Apple Watch Sport and an Apple Watch Edition to your phone, and you can switch between them without resetting and repairing the watch. This leads to a possibility that Apple is preparing to launch its new Apple Watch 2, and it would help existing Apple Watch owners to keep both timepieces in use. Another speculation is that Apple might introduce a fitness band and it works hand in hand with the Watch. watchOS 2.2 also brings other notable changes as well. The built-in maps will let you run searches and points of information under glance. So in theory if you’re wondering what to do at a location, this feature would help to recommend cafes, restaurants and shops near you. For fitness buffs, the watch will display more detailed information on your workout including active energy burned, plus a full summary on time spent on exercising and standing.

As we’ve covered stories before about small  modular smartphones  or  modular phone cases , we thought it’d be fitting to follow up with a bigger modular device — a TV. Yup,  Samsung  have come up with a modular TV that can split into several different parts and dance around your wall like something you’d find in a bachelor pad from the future. If you can’t wrap your head around what I’m talking about, take a look at this short clip by Gizmodo: Pretty freaking cool. However, Mashable’s Pete Pachal does note that while all the moving around is cool and stuff, when the screens do come together, he could see the seams between the displays which we found pretty disappointing. Then again this is relatively new tech so there are plenty of kinks to work out. Another TV that Samsung had on display showcased the ability for the TV to change its aspect ratios with the modular technology. The display could rotate two sides of the screen to switch it from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 4:3 aspect ratio in seconds. This means you can use up all of those valuable pixels for either of the popular aspect ratios, eliminating those annoying black bars. It’s pretty cool but once again Pete noted that the seam was visible. One final modular TV on display, however, showcased what is realistically the closest to a completed product — a massive 170″ wall TV that is made up of several smaller panels. Mashable notes that this is perhaps the most practical use of the modular technology, especially since the seams were not visible. Not only does it allow manufacturers to push the TV’s size to even more ridiculous proportions, Mashable notes that it also makes these monstrous TVs easier to ship because movers can break down a huge set to smaller screens. That’s cool and all but we can think of one more way to utilise these modular panels. Assuming they’re easy to remove and hot swap, parents could easily remove a section of the TV to prevent their kids from watching it when they’re being grounded or during their study sessions. In fact, you could probably remove one panel and bring it along with you on holiday to discourage thieves from nicking your precious television. Then again they’d have to have a pretty sizable moving truck to be able to ship a 170″ television in the first place. Either way, as all modular things usually are, the possibilities are almost endless. What do you guys think of a modular TV? Can you think of any other useful things it can bring to the table that your current TV set can’t? Let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"
Rory Lee,Anyone can crash your WhatsApp with the power of emojis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/11/anyone-can-crash-your-whatsapp-with-the-power-of-emojis/,"Android,emoji crash whatsapp,smartphone,Whatsapp,whatsapp crash,whatsapp emoji,WhatsApp vulnerability,whatsapp weakeness","Android,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2016-01-11,"WhatsApp  seems to be full of vulnerabilities these days. At first, it tried to steal your  banking information  through a malware in WhatsApp’s update, now it seems that you can crash specific users’ apps by sending them a whole bunch of emojis. 5,000 emojis to be precise. Researcher Indrajeet Bhuyan reveals that people can cause Android versions of the WhatsApp application to crash by sending them at least 5,000 emojis from the web version of WhatsApp. When a user receives the application and tries to open it, the whole app would crash. The only way to recover from that is to delete the entire conversation. Through our experimentation, it does indeed work. When we tried to open the “malicious” message, sure enough, our application crashed and we had to close and restart it before we could access the app again. However, the other conversations were unaffected by the malicious thread, so as long as you leave that conversation alone it won’t crash the application. This also works for group chats. The only way to access that conversation again is to delete the entire thread and start a new conversation with that contact. That said, if you have 4GB of RAM like we did on our Oppo R7s, you can have varying degrees of success in opening the thread again though you would have to wait awhile. This vulnerability does not extend to the iOS version of WhatsApp as the emojis only cause the app to lag, unlike a previous  iOS vulnerability  that relied on a specific message. Although WhatsApp does have a character limit of 6,000 — to prevent messages that the application cannot handle — it seems that this still far too many as a mere 5,000 emojis will kill the app. When talking about the potential exploits of having such a vulnerability, Bhuyan says that an attacker could be sending abusive messages to their victim, blackmailing or threatening them, then send them 5,000 emojis to crash that thread and make it so that the victim can’t access the thread for evidence again. Let’s hope WhatsApp (or Facebook) pushes out a fix for this soon before people with bad intentions catch on and start abusing this. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"
Arif Lee,Say hello to the first solar-powered 4K action camera,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/say-hello-to-the-first-solar-powered-4k-action-camera/,"4K action camera,4K camera,Action Camera,Activeon,Activeon camera,Activeon Solar X action camera,Activeon Solar X camera,camera technology,CES 2016,Consumer Electronics Show 2016,solar powered action camera,solar powered camera,solar technology,Solar X","Cool stuff,Technologies",2016-01-08,"Humans (us included) are slowly realising that the finite resources around us are dwindling away but we can expect the sun to outlast our generation. The Sun, a massive star that sits in the center of the solar system; once considered a deity to some, it has always played a huge part in our lives – powering our electronics included. Solar panels have been here, there and everywhere but none of them have been mounted to an action camera. Or rather someone didn’t think of it yet. Somewhat bizarre if you consider the main flaw of something so small – battery life – usually running out of juice in a couple of hours. You won’t have to worry about that anymore as Activeon has just announced its solar-powered 4K action camera. Aptly named the Solar X, this is an action camera that uses the sun to power itself. Besides having solar capabilities and being relatively the same size as a GoPro, this action cam comes with a 16-megapixel CMOS sensor at an aperture of f/2.4. If you ever want to take stills with it, it’ll manage quick snaps up to 6 frames per second. Able to shoot in 4K resolution, this camera has a 2-inch touchscreen for its menu options and checking your content. It’ll also support WiFi data transfers to Android and iOS devices; you can choose to use the mini HDMI port instead if you like. Standalone, it’ll deliver two hours of battery life, numbers that don’t amaze us by much but when you strap on its X Station solar panels, you’ll get an additional four hours of recording time. And by chance you’re having a long shooting day, fully recharging the camera using the sun will only take an hour or 80% in just half an hour with its “Burst Speed Charging”. We’d like to see more companies make use of solar power, even if they aren’t making action cameras. After all, soon enough our Earth will eventually be too environmentally imbalanced for us to live comfortably with global warming already taking place.  Don’t bother telling yourself otherwise, this “theory” is  legit  as can be. We’ve already seen the  Paris Agreement  take place last year and we can only hope nations of the world can curb CO2 emissions. Before we ramble on any longer, filmmakers will have to wait until March before they can pick up the Solar X that goes for US$ 450 (RM 1,969). Thinking about it, this action camera could probably be used as a car dash cam as well. Malaysia has sunny days year around, so this is a no-brainer; more so when it’ll technically always be powered. When it arrives it’ll be compatible with 40 add-on accessories that include mounts, grips, selfie sticks, and straps; underwater goggles and a WiFi remote too. Adding that all up, it’ll probably cost a fair bit but the future is all about renewable energy; a fair price to save the Earth eh? [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

While this time the details have been all over the place, we all know that Lenovo bought Motorola away from Google in 2013.  Today, news broke that Lenovo will bid farewell to the “Motorola” branding and pushing solely the “Moto” name. So they are removing a name but the entity will continue to tinker away under a division of Lenovo. One has to have a sense of humour to appreciate the different stances that took place but for once we think Lenovo and Motorola have finally sorts out their branding issues or so we hope. Back in August,  this  was what Lenovo decided to do as reported by Android Authority. A slight U-turn of decisions by our records but we guess it’s not easy running a company as large as Lenovo and they’re bound to make some wrong turns along the way. At least following their statements today we can conclude that brand name-wise, Motorola will cease to exist. Subsequently, any new devices under the umbrella will be sold as Moto by Lenovo or Vibe by Lenovo. So the crux of all this is, any future “Moto” device will still very much be built, designed and created by Motorola – e.g. Moto X, Moto G and Moto E – the only different being the company name that sells it. Business will go on, as usual, just the technicalities behind the “names” who sell them will differ. We already saw all of this coming since Q3 of last year but riding the “Motorola” name is really sad to see. In the light of this move, we’re going to take everyone on a trip down memory lane. [  IMAGE SOURCE  ] Do you remember the powerhouse brand that created the first handheld mobile cell phone (DynaTAC) in 1973? Yupp, Motorola. Then what about the RAZR V3 flip phones that changed the game forever? Motorola again. The company we once knew has changed throughout the years, same goes for their ownership but under the surface, it seems there’s nothing much to shout about. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  3  ]"
Rory Lee,Could this be confirmation that Samsung is launching four S7 variants?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/could-this-be-confirmation-that-samsung-is-launching-four-s7-variants/,"Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge plus,Samsung Galaxy S7 plus,Spigen","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2016-01-08,"A few days ago, popular leakster  @OnLeaks  dropped a 360-degree video render of what should be the upcoming  Samsung Galaxy S7 . The video, while it gives us some insight into what the regular version of the device should look like, it doesn’t have any renders of the variants. Awhile back, there was some discussion on whether the S7 launch in February would see four variants (the S7, S7 Plus, S7 edge and S7 edge Plus) of Samsung’s new flagship. We didn’t think so, but new information has surfaced recently about the possibility of a Galaxy S7 Plus and a Galaxy S7 edge Plus being launched. Popular case manufacturer Spigen has put their Samsung Galaxy S7 cases on sale on  Amazon  even before the device has been launched, though the cases are not on  Spigen’s website . The cases are going from USD14.99 (around RM66). What’s interesting isn’t that the cases are out — because this isn’t the first time Spigen has  done this  — it is that there is a case for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Plus and Galaxy S7 edge Plus. This could very well be confirmation of an earlier @evleaks post about the 4 S7 variants. While we don’t think that Samsung will be launching the S7 Plus and the S7 edge Plus in February, it also doesn’t make sense for Spigen to have the preorder for those cases so soon if Samsung weren’t going to launch their devices until the end of the year. If they do launch four of them at the same time, the devices could either be separated by region, size or even processor. However, if the devices do get separated by region like  HTC’s One M9  and  One M9+ , we’re sure there will be many unhappy Samsung fans. That said, the images look like placeholder/rendered images because if we were to compare them to @OnLeaks’ (who is quite reputable when it comes to leaks) youtube video, you’d notice that Spigen’s model device is missing the  Galaxy Note5 -esque rear curves. As a recap of the specs. both the S7 and the S7 edge are said to run either their latest Exynos 8890 processor or a Snapdragon 820 depending on the market paired with 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. Good news is that that storage is said to be expandable as leaks claim Samsung is  bringing back the microSD  slot that was missing from their 2015 flagships. Camera wise, the Samsungs are said to have a lower megapixel count, at 12MP for the primary, but feature the Korean manufacturer’s latest BRITECELL camera technology that is said to improve low light photography and reduce the camera hump. That coupled with a rumoured f/1.7 aperture lens should see the camera do quite well in low light. The S7 should come in a 5.1″ form-factor while the S7 edge takes on the 5.5″ body. Both devices could also be waterproof,  which looks like  a trend  for the upcoming 2016 flagships. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ]"

Rory Lee,This is a 16-lens DSLR killer that can fit in your pocket,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-a-16-lens-dslr-killer-that-can-fit-in-your-pocket/,"16 lens camera,Android Marshmallow,camera,CES 2016,DSLR,DSLR killer,L16 camera,Light L16,Light L16 camera,Snapdragon 820","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-08,"This has been the hardest story I’ve ever written simply because of the way the camera looks. If you have Trypophobia, you’ve been warned! The problem with getting started on a DSLR is that you have to fork out a tonne of cash to be able to afford a decent body plus a lens. Sure some of you might say that you’re OK with the kit lens, but let’s face it, we all want a red band around our lens. Unless you’re not using a Canon device. A startup called Light is trying to change that with their L16 camera — a camera that has 16 lenses packed into a body small enough to fit in your pocket. Well, sort of. By Mashable’s estimate, the camera is about the size of three iPhone 6 Pluses stacked together. It probably won’t fit in your skinny jeans then. Nevertheless, it is still an impressive feat that they managed to cram that much tech and that many lenses into a body so small. Oh, did we mention it’s powered by a Snapdragon 820 SoC? On the hardware side of things, this camera has 16 (5x35mm, 5x70mm, 6x150mm) different prime lenses that work together to take an image. The camera sets it up in a way that — depending on your zoom and framing — 10 lenses will fire at the same time, taking different quadrants of an image. Note that Mashable says the device has 120mm lenses instead of 150mm lenses, but from the company’s video and several other sites, they say that it uses 150mm lenses. The camera then stitches the 10 images together to form a high 52-megapixel image that is should eliminate quality loss normally experienced at the fringes of a lens. These lenses don’t use any kind of fancy glass, instead, they all use f/2.4 P5 plastic lenses coupled with smartphone camera sensors. Plus, since it uses so many lenses at so many different focal lengths, Light claims that the camera has a near infinite depth of field — something you can adjust in post processing. Sporting a 5″ touchscreen paired with a Snapdragon 820 SoC and an interface based off of Android M, this device looks to bring camera and smartphone imaging technology closer together. Don’t be fooled, this doesn’t have a cellular modem so you can’t make phone calls. A best of both worlds then? We certainly hope so. News of this little guy has been floating around for quite awhile now but recently Mashable got to take a look at one of the prototypes for the device. According to them, the photo stitching on the prototype took a little while to process (it ultimately froze), with the company stating that they’re trying to get the image stitching and processing down to below 1 minute. A pretty ridiculous waiting time for a photo if you ask me. The silver lining is that the processing time is only for the 52-megapixel image, so if you want to post a quick snap on social media, the camera will generate a lower quality image for you. My nose is wrinkling in annoyance. According to Mashable, when Light compared the images between an  iPhone , Canon 5D Mark III and the Light L16, they were impressed with how detailed the L16 images were but noted that there was a lot of image noise. Battery life on the other hand, Mashable says that the company ballparks it at about 400 shots. While this is a noble attempt at killing our tried and tested DSLR cameras, it seems like it is still a long way off from actually dealing the final blow. Even if the software is perfected and the device works wonderfully, we (like Mashable) believe that the DSLR will continue to live on and be the primary tool for professional photographers. For events and on-the-go photography though, we can see how this device can be very useful for the professionals thanks to it’s portability and, hopefully, stellar image quality. We will have to see how it stacks up against other compact monsters like the Sony RX100 series before jumping to a conclusion though. That said, if this device works out, it could be a great (and much cheaper, coming in at USD1,699 which is around RM7452) alternative to the DSLR for hobbyists and prosumers. Exciting stuff then!

The device that aims to reinvent the phone with its 3 in 1 proposition – an iPod, a phone and an Internet communications device. At the same time, Apple had also dropped the word “Computer” from its company name, to better reflect its growing product portfolio that goes beyond Macs.  The move of getting into the phone business was timely. Close to a billion mobile phones was sold in 2006 worldwide. That’s about 5X more than PCs, over 7X the number of MP3 players and 10X more than digital cameras at that time. Steve Jobs was targeting just 1% market share with a goal of selling 10 million iPhones for 2008.  The iPhone was revolutionary back then with its full touch-screen capacitive display with its multi-touch technology. Browsing the web was smooth and there were no cluttered keys or buttons that get in the way. Steve Jobs even mocked the use of a stylus as the iPhone was intuitive enough to be used with your bare fingers. Compared to today’s iPhones, the original model was very barebones. At a time when smartphone makers are moving towards 3G, the iPhone was only a 2G device supporting up to EDGE. There was no AppStore, meaning you’re stuck with its native apps, and the common copy and paste feature was only introduced with iOS 3.0, 2 years later. At the time, many had doubts on the iPhone. The base 4GB model was priced from US$499 (RM1,746 at that time) on a 2-year contract. If you want more storage, the 8GB version was going for US$599 (about RM2096), also on contract. Even Steve Ballmer of Microsoft had a laugh about it and this was a time when Windows Mobile and Nokia Symbian phones reign supreme.  When it was eventually released in 2008, Apple  sold over 10 million  phones, surpassing its original goal and the rest is history. For Malaysia, the first iPhone to reach here officially was the  iPhone 3G via Maxis . It was priced at RM2,540 for 8GB and RM2,960 for 16GB models.  Until this very day, the iPhone is still considered as the de facto benchmark for the smartphone industry. It changed the way we interact with touch-screen devices and how we consume content and services on a mobile device. However, after Steve Job’s departure, it seems that Apple hasn’t been innovating as much as before, with the competition offering compelling choices at a much competitive price point.  For Steve Baller, he regretted not moving into the hardware business earlier, which saw themselves overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

We need it to function but often don’t bother getting enough of it. For humans, at least, that’s a proposition that is a paradox in itself. Personally, there has never been an issue getting up from the bed but we can all nod in agreement about some people in our lives that hit that snooze button a handful of times. Often some of them never leave their pillow fort but for those who really have commitments worth getting up for, the Ruggie could be something for you. Ruggie in as the name implies, is a floor mat that doubles as an alarm clock and for it to stop ringing, you’ll actually have to get out of bed – you can’t snooze it either.   How do you shut Ruggie off? You place both your feet onto the “smart” mat for a good three seconds. We’re not too sure how perceptive Ruggie is as the video doesn’t really “show” it working as advertised. After it has got to up and at em’ the alarm will shut off and start playing customisable motivational speeches and humorous phrases to get your day moving with some positivity – more of a novelty feature but it’s still nice to have – I mean, having Schwarzenegger himself give you a speech every morning to “Get to the chopaaaa/showerrrrr” would be really cool. Crowdsourcing their effort on Kickstarter, Ruggie has already surpassed its goal of US$ 50,000 in just five days. Battery powered by three AAA batteries, Ruggie will go without a battery swap for at least a year. Pledges for the “smart” rug currently start at US$ 110 ( RM 484) with shipping to Malaysia going for an additional US$ 21 (RM 92.52). The pledge gets you: Before the Ruggie came into the picture, we never thought they’d be so many quirky and innovative alarm clocks. Some require you to bust out 30 bicep curls; Clocky makes snoozers run around their bedroom to locate the wheeled alarm clock; and BanClock requires the sleeper to put actual coins into it, making a point that time is money. You can find a full list  here . Whenever backing a Kickstarter project be aware that some projects are never delivered to backers, disappointing we know but it’s something we’ll have to live with. Make sure you raise any concerns in the comment section and run through the FAQs before you do so. So what do you think? Will this make its way into your bedrooms? Well if the answer is a yes there’s gonna be a long wait – Ruggie’s Kickstarter states that “deivery” (assuming they meant delivery) will only happen in September of this year. That’s a lot of snoozing till then. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

If they’re bringing such premium materials to their budget Redmi line, that means the bar has been set for their flagship Mi series, starting with the  Mi 5 . Previously leaked press renders hinted that the device would take a rather big turn when it comes to design as it looks to feature a physical button at the front. Now, new images have surfaced on Weibo of the actual device that seems to confirm that suspicion. Besides that, the device also seems to sport metal rails along the side that should lend it a more premium feel in the hand though we’re not entirely sure if the device will have an all-metal unibody though it does seem likely. The speakers look to be placed at the bottom of the device, flanking a charging port. Whether or not that will be USB Type-C port remains to be seen. Since it’s a flagship, the device is no slouch, sporting Qualcomm’s latest quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There are rumours that there will be another model sporting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is also said to feature a 5.2-inch 1080×1920 pixel display, but there are other rumours that it might be a  quad HD display  (2560×1440) instead. As far as camera optics are concerned, the device is rumoured to have a 16-megapixel rear sensor with a 13-megapixel front camera to boot. It is also said to feature a 3,600 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0. Those are some interesting specifications and design choices but do note that these are not officially confirmed so take it with a grain of salt. The smartphone is apparently already in the process of being manufactured and is rumoured to come out in February. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ]"

Rory Lee,This is the mechanical Apple Watch you’ve been waiting for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/this-is-the-mechanical-apple-watch-youve-been-waiting-for/,"apple,apple joke,Apple Watch,H Moser & Cie,joke,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,Swiss Alp Watch,watch","Apple,Industry in General,Mobile Devices",2016-01-08,"Have you ever looked down at your  Apple Watch  and thought it was simply  waaay  too digital? You’re not alone! Swiss watchmaker H. Moser & Cie, who are seemingly appalled by the smartwatch fad, have launched what is essentially a mechanical Apple Watch. Remember that one guy saying that the Apple Watch looked like it was  designed by students ? Well, this Swiss company just took making fun of the Apple Watch to a whole new level. You might have noticed that Apple’s coveted Watch has finally  made its way  to our shores. If you haven’t, what rock have you been living under?! While many see the Apple Watch as a marvelous piece of engineering, these Swiss watchmakers are unimpressed. So much so they told smartwatch users to “get a life” by upgrading to a mechanical watch. Oops, we’d better not show them our  smartwatch buyer’s guide  then. Dubbed the Swiss Alp Watch, H. Moser & Cie’s light-hearted jab at Apple comes complete with an Apple-esque product video, complete with rotating close up shots and cheesy “revolutionary” one-line product descriptions. There’s even audio of what sounds like someone taking a bite out of an apple. Kind of reminds us of the time Ikea took a  jab at Apple , complete with the same  type of packaging! . As amusing as this video is, the Swiss Alp Watch is certainly no joke. Besides being a carbon copy of Apple’s smartwatch, the Swiss Alp Watch comes in 18-carat white gold body that has the same dimensions as the Apple Watch. It also has a screw-in non-digital crown adorned with an M, which will power on the device with a single twist. Besides that, the watch has a see-through sapphire crystal rear case that allows you to see the watch in all its beautifully-crafted mechanical glory. As far as features are concerned, the watch (obviously) doesn’t have support for phone calls, heartbeat sensors, text messages or sketching. It does, however, show what H. Moser & Cie calls the “most valuable commodity”: The time. It will “let you reconnect with people by getting out there, meeting your friends and spending time with your loved ones”. All that intricate engineering will cost you, as the watch — which is limited to 50 units — costs a whopping USD24,900 (around RM109,000) which is a touch more than the Apple Watch Edition, which will set you back RM80,000. Okay, maybe more of a smack than a touch. Either way, this video shouldn’t be taken too seriously, as The Verge points out because H. Moser & Cie is by no means a large watchmaker. So it’s more likely that this was made simply to be a tongue-in-cheek joke than anything else. It supposedly represents the company’s “resilience” and their “ferocious desire to fight our values and traditions”, embodying everything they believe in. The important thing is that this is compatible with  every  device. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

Alexander Wong,This is what the OPPO F1 smartphone looks like,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/07/this-is-how-the-oppo-f1-smartphone-looks-like/,"Android,F series,Oppo,OPPO F Malaysia,OPPO F series,OPPO F1,OPPO F1 Leak,OPPO F1 Malaysia,OPPO F1f,Oppo Malaysia,OPPO Smartphones,smartphones","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2016-01-07,"Not too long after  its teaser  went public, the  OPPO F1  has finally appeared ahead of its launch. According to OPPO, this is their new mid-range device that focuses on producing premium-quality images.  As mentioned earlier, it looks like another OPPO R series that’s touched up with rounded edges along the sides. Now we finally have a clearer look thanks to a Vietnamese tech site that managed to get a proper hands-on.  The OPPO F1 looks very much like an  R7  but with some subtle changes on the specs and design. For starters, the front features a 5″ HD 720p display and underneath it gets a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. From the video, it appears to be having just 16GB of storage but there’s a hybrid dual-SIM slot that accepts microSD.  The rear camera is said to be a 13MP main unit with Phase Detection AF, while the front has an 8MP shooter. This is hardly any difference from its current OPPO R7 range but hopefully it gets a couple of surprises during its official reveal. The OPPO R7 was  priced  at RM1,598, while its lower spec R7 Lite is priced at RM1,298.  If OPPO wished to make this a compelling mid-range smartphone, they would need to price it competitively against the likes of the  Lenovo Vibe Shot . The OPPO F1 will be announced next month and it will be heading for Malaysia.  [  SOURCE   2  ]"
Rory Lee,Metal-clad Xiaomi Redmi 3 to be launched next week,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/07/metal-clad-xiaomi-redmi-3-to-be-launched-next-week/,"Android,Redmi 3,Redmi 3 launch,smart phonea,smartphone,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Redmi 3,Xiaomi Redmi 3 launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2016-01-07,"UPDATE:   The Redmi 3 will also feature a 4100 mAh battery. A while back we  highlighted an interesting entry  into the Chinese certification authority, TENAA, which looked like a metal bodied Redmi 3. Now, on Xiaomi’s official Weibo account, the company released an image confirming our suspicions. What’s more, they’ve also included a release date! Beyond that, Xiaomi hasn’t confirmed any of the other specifications but if we’re going off the TENAA entry, the device should have a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. That 5″ screen should also be a 720p HD screen and the device will likely run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. For camera optics, the Redmi 3 should have a 13MP primary camera paired with a 5MP front camera combo. On paper, this is a significant boost over the Redmi 2, pushing this into the mid-range category. We can only hope that the price will not follow suit. Popular Youtuber MKBHD once said that good phones are getting cheap while cheap phones are getting good and we share that sentiment. This is definitely something that is catching on because it seems that even Xiaomi realised they can’t continue making plasticky budget phones anymore. The only unfortunate thing is that this move to metal will most likely bring a higher price tag, which we’re sure many would frown upon. Keep in mind that this device will probably take a few months to reach our shores. What do you guys think, would you pay more for this Redmi? [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

It seems that we’re spoilt for choice because there is a smartwatch for almost all your needs. Want a fancy schmancy one to take to a cocktail party? Or perhaps a bling-a-ding-dong watch for you to go clubbing with? No, perhaps you’re more down to earth and you want a simple black-and-white timepiece instead. The only problem with having so many options is that when it comes to choosing the right one for you, factoring in price and availability in Malaysia, things can get very confusing very quickly. To help you with your smartwatch purchasing, we at SoyaCincau.com have compiled a list of some of the best smartwatches that you can (and eventually will) be able to purchase in Malaysia."
Alexander Wong,Maybank and Visa lets you make payments from your wrist,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/08/maybank-visa-payband-contactless-payment-malaysia/,"Contactless Payment,Maybank,Maybank PayBand,Maybank Visa PayBand,NFC,Smart Wearable,Visa,Visa Payband,wearable,Wearable Payment","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Others",2016-01-08,"Paying by cash is troublesome. You would need to keep a sufficient amount in your wallet and if you don’t have exact change, you’ll end up with bulky coins in your pocket. While Touch ‘n Go is gaining momentum in stores, here’s another way to pay without cash. Maybank together with Visa has just announced the PayBand, the first payment wearable in Malaysia. According to Visa, Malaysians are moving towards contactless transactions and they are more likely to shop at a place that accepts one.  How it works is somewhat similar to the Maybank’s  Visa payWave Microtag , which is a sticker that you can stick onto your smartphone. Details of Maybank’s Visa PayBand isn’t available on their site, but if it follows the same mechanism, you can make payments up to RM250 without the need of signatures or pin numbers. Think of it as a Touch ‘n Go in a wristband form and it charges directly to your credit card.  In terms of acceptance, it will work with Visa PayWave terminals throughout Malaysia. Just like that PayWave enabled credit card, you would need to wave it in less than 4cm from the terminal to make a payment. This apparently is better than handing over a physical card as there’s no chance for merchants to obtain your full card details. You can learn more about its availability  here . The PayBand device isn’t entirely new as  Barclaycard  had introduced this in the UK in wristband, keychain fob and sticker format. So if you’re going for a jog, you can stop for coffee or breakfast without carrying your wallet. We have yet to see the Payband ourselves and we are curious to know if there are offering customisable band options.  With most smartphones and even smartwatches these days supporting NFC, we are still surprised that mobile NFC payments have yet to catch on in Malaysia. There were several attempts by Maxis with  FastTap , in collaboration with CIMB and Maybank. Unfortunately, it was short-lived and we haven’t heard of them since. Carrying an extra band would be quite cumbersome if you’re already wearing a smartband or a smartwatch. Having SamsungPay and Apple Pay in Malaysia would be a more elegant solution don’t you think? Would you consider getting a Visa PayBand? Let us know in the comments below. [  SOURCE   2   3  ]"

Dubbed the Cota transmitter, this cool hub is reminiscent of Google’s OnHub, albeit a little larger. Founded in 2008, Ossia wants to hit the ground running this year by announcing that their transmitter will be in store shelves and homes by Winter of 2016 – making REAL wireless charging a thing. This won’t stop at phones, it’ll extend to other household electronics too: remote controls, security systems and even battery operated devices. The wireless charging system is rather complex and really smart at the same time. So you’ll have to place a Cota base station near the device you’d like to charge. Inside the base station is packed with tiny antennas and to get your device charging, it’ll have to be “tweaked” to include a built-in RF receiving chip. In other words, Cota transmitter plus RF receiving chip equals mid-air charging. You don’t NEED to have the chip installed inside your device and for most people Ossia’s wireless charging case lets you do the same, despite adding size. Though you should know that Ossia is trying their best to downsize the chip to make it easier for OEMs and manufacturers to place them inside devices. RF signals are sent wirelessly through the Cota chip one hundred times every second while the base stations’ tiny antennas pick them up. Detecting those signals from different angles, the base station then relays wireless RF power in the same trajectory. When the two signals meet on the same “path”, they’ll match up and wala! Wireless charging. So far Ossia envisions that by year end, they’ll get a transmitter working with a range of 10 feet. They’ll continuously work on this and the plan is to eventually release larger base stations that will be able to support charging for larger spaces. Now the tradeoffs: Ossia’s tech makes a big step but it’s only the beginning, hence don’t expect Quick Charge 3.0 or VOCC-like speeds. Yet it’ll be really amazing to think that while you can’t see it, Cota is beaming power to your devices. We can already hear people making implications about these “waves” potentially causing health problems for humans and animals. Studies and research on the effects of micro/radio waves are out there and before we start mass producing something that’ll likely be everywhere, there should be some sort of testing done.

Usually adopting a twice in one year refresh for their devices, Sony decided to focus instead on marketing and promoting its current generation of smartphones. And they haven’t disappointed either. Take a look at their latest video that attempts to put a dozen  Xperia Z5 Compacts  shooting 4K in harmony; that works out to 12 4K Sony sensors or “48K” of sheer madness. The final result? Mind blowing 360-degree views of the Les Deux Alps in France. Gape and stare in awe taking in footage from the icy slopes, snowboarders zooming down the course and the panorama views as they bask in the sun while out in the snow – yes it sounds as majestic as you think. Marking their innovative bid in creating a custom 3D printed rig just for the occasion, this breathtaking scene was more to show off their camera capabilities opposed to the prowess of Sony’s creative R&D team. But they deserve their fair share of credit. Editing this video that took place at the Rise Ski and Snowboard Festival in the French Alps, was probably a daunting task given that you could barely see any video stitching or gaps.  You can also expect a lot of retouching as when we tried out the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual’s video capabilities, we weren’t too happy with the quality of the content BUT the company’s SteadyShot video stabilisation was really amazing. Just to recap, Sony’s Z5 line all carry the same 1 / 2.3-inch 23-megapixel Sony Exmor RS sensor. Its hybrid autofocus has Sony boasting about a 0.03-second speed; you’ll be able to take stills and video up to 12800 (Photo) and 3200 (Video).

Refused to be acknowleged as  TV or a tablet , it is seen as a new entertainment hub that sits on top of your desk instead of your lap.  It runs on Android and to differentiated its use from a tablet, the interface uses big buttons and fonts for a touch-screen TV like experience. Under the hood, it runs on a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and comes with 32GB of storage on-board.

Did you wish it came with a slide/flip/rotate out physical keyboard? Or did you wish that  Samsung  made a  funky strap-on keyboard  like they did with their bigger models? Yes? Good news then! One2Touch have introduced the SlimType — an NFC keyboard smartphone cover designed specifically for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Do you want to touch it? Smartphones took the world by storm as people discovered exactly how much they could do on a tiny little device that fit in their pocket. Users began using them for instant messaging, web browsing, social media browsing and media consumption. In fact, people are using them for anything but making a call. However, productivity has been the weakest link in the smartphone’s chain, due to many reasons. First is the fact that with screen real estate that is only the size of your palm, it is quite difficult to view something like a spreadsheet, for instance. Matters are made worse when users have to type because the virtual keyboard usually takes up half the screen. Plus it isn’t very satisfying typing on a virtual keyboard — one reason why  BlackBerry  kept the keyboard on the  PRIV . With SlimType though, it looks like you can use your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge as a productivity device. There is one major problem that we’ve picked up on, though. Have you seen it yet? Yup, it doesn’t have a kickstand. Most tablet keyboard covers either rely on the device’s built-in kickstand or they fold in some sort of elaborate manner to form a triangular base. On the SlimType though, none of those options appear to be available. We don’t know about you but a kickstand seems mighty useful when you’re trying to be productive. The keyboard doesn’t look like it has much travel or much of a mechanical feel, which makes sense since it’s a phone cover. Doesn’t mean it will be nice to type on, though. Maybe this keyboard can work in a pinch or if you simply hate virtual keyboards and what it does to the size of your screen. Will it truly turn your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 edge into much more of a productivity beast than it already is? We doubt it. A cool attempt, but alas it doesn’t seem very practical. Although this device, which is on  Amazon , currently doesn’t ship directly to Malaysia, there are still ways to get such products into your hands. Google it you lazy people! We’re the type of people who simply must have the best when it comes to productive typing, so maybe we’re being overcritical. What do you guys think? Would you consider dropping USD39.99 (around RM174) on it? [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

Razer hopes their second time’s a charm, releasing their second wearable: the Nabu Watch. And ironically the gaming brand chose a fitness-focused smartwatch, a gamble we never expected. Made to look like a digital Chronograph (errr G-Shock), the Nabu smartwatch has a 5 ATM water resistant rating, while it’s rugged enough to withstand drops up to 5 meters.  Razer adds a regular old illuminated backlit display we’d expect on a normal watch, hands it features accustomed to on watches: alarm, stopwatch, world time but all these numbers sync through Bluetooth to ensure they’re as accurate as you can get. Nabu App Fitbit App Compatibility will be a-okay as far as  Android  and  iOS  devices are concerned while the Nabu app looks a lot like Fitbit’s – imitation is a form of flattery, it seems. Nabu is a dual displayed smartwatch, so the secondary OLED screen will be the sole “smart feature” screen. Raising your wrist allows you activate it, enabling previews of phone notifications and activity/data tracking through its accelerometer sensors. Though it seems an optical heart-rate monitor didn’t warrant enough importance for them. You’ll also be able to share social media details easily using a shake-to-shake feature, making contact exchanges seamless and more than just a simple “introductory” while meeting someone for the first time. When considering power sources, the two displays rely on different battery sources: Thus, if you’re a simple person that loves G-Shocks that aren’t G-Shocks, you can opt to leave the secondary display “off” and simply stick to the main one. But that defeats the purpose of a smartwatch anyway, doesn’t it? Razer’s Nabu might appeal to adventure folk who want something that looks stealthy and can take a beating. More so for fitness aficionados who go out seeking a sweat outdoors; wilderness optional. Standard Edition Forged Edition Going with the duality of things, there will be two models available, a polycarbonate body that goes for US$ 149.99 (RM 646.96) and a little while later a Forged Edition model will be released. The latter model will arrive with stainless steel buttons and the same black finish; it’ll go for US$ 199.99 (RM 868.26). In the same pricing ballpark as other smartwatches that we’ve seen, Razer has a lot of competition out there and being their second try, they’re gonna need a lot of luck. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

When I look around at my friends, more than half of them have more well-defined abs than I do life goals. To fulfill this desire to track health and fitness, tech companies have launched a myriad of fitness bands, trackers and applications designed to keep you as well informed about your body as possible. But while most of those devices existed as individual elements, none were truly unified. At least, that’s what HTC and Under Armour said when they launched their brand new ‘fitness system’ that costs USD400 (around RM1751). You must be thinking, you’d get a lot of gear right? Well, that depends on your definition of ‘a lot’. What we do know is that with the UA HealthBox, you will be receiving three devices — a fitness band, a smart scale and a heart-rate monitor. Dubbed the UA Band, this fitness band is designed to be worn all-day every day because it tracks daily activities, workout and sleep. Under the band’s “seamless exterior shell” is a display which is “discreetly hidden” allowing it to disappear when not in use. While we don’t know how hidden they wanted the screen to be, from the pictures (even their product shots) it certainly looks like it’s well hidden enough to be a nightmare to view under sunlight. The UA Band also features an advanced workout mode with a display that stays on during the workout as well as an LED that indicates heart rate zone when paired with the heart rate monitor. Wow, a screen that stays on! Next, we have the UA Heart Rate — a compact heart rate monitor that is designed to be undetectable during workouts. It is also supposed to help individuals monitor intensity and train smarter while providing an accurate calculation of calories burned. How refreshing, a heart rate monitor that actually does all this accurately! Finally, we have the UA Scale. It’s a smart scale that is “beautifully crafted” and WiFi enabled in an “iconic circular design”. This scale also has a hidden LED display that makes the technology invisible when not in use. It also looks like there is a “nifty” feature where they show you a bunch of logos, greet you and only after they’ve done all that do they show you your weight. Perfect for when you’re in a hurry! According to them, these three devices are perfectly synced to provide the user with a “customised experience”, but they fail to mention exactly what that customised experience is. Based on the video, it looks like it’s just a personalised profile on your “dashboard” in the UA Record app. Speaking of the app, UA and HTC have made it available in both the  App Store  and  Google Play  as a free download. The application shows you the results of your daily health and fitness tracking plus a “How do you feel?” scale. That said, there is some benefit to having all of these devices connected. Like they highlighted in their video, there is a lot of potential for growth into an actual ecosystem (via smart shoes, headphones, etc.). Plus there is the benefit of it being simple to use and understand. For now though, this “system” seems more like your paying a lot for a brand to be plastered onto existing technology and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, look at Beats by Dre, they’re selling like hot cakes. This fitness system will be available on January 22 in the US, retailing for USD400 (around RM1751), with pre-orders beginning today on  HTC ,  UA  and at Under Armour Brand House locations. The HealthBox will eventually roll out internationally throughout this year."

Recently released in Taiwan, the ASUS Zenfone Zoom is a pretty interesting device. While smartphone cameras have gotten better with each iteration, one of their flaws have always been a lack of optical zoom. This was because adding an optical zoom would cause your device to be much thicker than a regular smartphone — a compromise device manufacturers were not willing to make. So, unless one was willing to manually zoom with one’s feet, smartphone photographers often had to settle for a grainier picture if they wanted to zoom. With the Zenfone Zoom, however, ASUS is claiming that this is the thinnest 3x optical zoom smartphone…in the world. They accomplished this by mounting the smartphone camera’s dual periscope horizontally across the back of the device. As a result, it boasts a 5mm “ultra-thin edge” thanks to an ergonomic curve that looks a lot like ASUS’s other Zenfones. The primary camera itself, while only sporting 13-megapixels, comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS), laser autofocus, a dual-tone LED flash and a SmartFSI Panasonic sensor. To make up for the lack in resolution, ASUS has implemented a Super Resolution function that fuses four shots into one picture for greater clarity (up to 52MP). It also has ASUS’s PixelMaster 2.0 — a feature famed for its low-light performance. To facilitate the impressive camera specifications, the Zenfone Zoom will have not only have a dedicated shutter button, it also has a dedicated video button. It’s no slouch when it comes to performance either, sporting a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB/128GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). The phone will come running Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ASUS’s ZenUI skin on top. At the front, this camera-centric smartphone features a 5.5″ full-HD display tucked under Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. It also has a metal finish along the rails of the phone to give it a more premium feel. Around the back, there seems to be some differences compared to the one  launched in Taiwan recently , as that one had some kind of textured back (faux leather perhaps?). However, this could be because the images in the Malaysian site are outdated. If you head on over to the  global site  you can see that the build more closely resembles the one released in Taiwan. Nevertheless, we will find out how it looks like in about a week’s time. The Zenfone Zoom will sport a 3,000 mAh capacity battery, paired with ASUS’s BoostMaster technology. It is supposed to give you a 60% charge in 39 minutes. Although the Zenfone Zoom has support for up to 802.11ac WiFi, it only has one micro-SIM slot for mobile connectivity. In the US, the Zenfone Zoom comes in at around USD399, which translates to about RM1,760. Considering the state of the ringgit, an optimistic estimate of the Zenfone Zoom’s price here in Malaysia would be RM1,799, but realistically we should probably see it closer to RM1,899. While we’re pretty stoked about the device, we want to know what you guys think. Let us know in the comments below. Stay tuned for our coverage of the official release. [ SOURCE ]"

The LeTV Le Max Pro is a large 6.33″ phablet that pushes Quad HD resolution. Under the hood lies a Snapdragon 820 processor with quad Kyro cores at 2.2GHz that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. The processor claims to be more efficient with a 16nm process and it is accompanied by a Adreno 530 GPU. The new processor with quad-cores apparently provides 2X the performance of an Octa-Core based Snapdragon 810 unit.  The Sense ID is supposedly a more advanced biometric feature as it uses ultrasonic sound waves that’s superior than capacitive based scanners commonly used today. Instead of recording an image of your fingertips, Sense ID scans deeper below the skin. As a result, it harder to spoof and it works well even with contaminated fingers. Another advantage is that it works underneath glass, plastics and metal materials, allowing manufacturers to implement the sensor discreetly on smartphones.  In terms of design, it looks like a Huawei/honor device with a familiar antenna band stripes from an iPhone. Strangely there’s still a visible fingerprint scanner at the back which could have been omitted with Sense ID. The rear camera is said to be a 21MP shooter with Optical Image Stabilisation and powering this phablet is a generous 3,400mAh battery.  As seen in the pictures below, it uses USB Type-C for charging and data transfer. Connectivity wise, it also supports Cat 12 4G LTE with download speeds up to 600Mbps and uplink up to 150Mbps. There’s no mention of its availability but you can expect more Snapdragon 820 flagship smartphones to be announced next month during MWC 2016. [  SOURCE   2   3  ]"
Rory Lee,You will have to pay for your printed TM bill come July 2016. It’s time to go green,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/you-will-have-to-pay-for-your-printed-tm-bill-come-july-2016-its-time-to-go-green/,"streamyx,Streamyx bills,TM billing,TM charge printed bill,TM charges,TM charging for printed bills,TM e-Bill,TM printed bills,TM Streamyx,TM Surcharge,TM Unifi,Unifi,UniFi bills","Industry in General,Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2016-01-06,"I’m sure we all remember the time, towards the end of last year, when  TM  had  a little row with their customers  about incurring a surcharge for the issuing of a printed bill. Well, there has been a new development in the matter as TM have decided to postpone their defaulting to the e-Bill format by six months. Towards the end of last year, TM broadband subscribers (Streamyx and UniFi) exploded in outrage when they found out that TM was planning to charge them an exorbitant amount for their printed bills. The ISP justified their actions by claiming that it was part of their move to go green — cutting down and eliminating the usage of paper. As a form of ‘motivation’ to get customers to switch to e-Billing, the telecommunications company was going to incur a monthly charge of RM2 for those who still want to receive their bill in paper format. Charge Malaysians extra for anything and you know outrage will soon follow. In any case, TM issued an explanation that ended up giving consumers more confusion than confirmation because while they announced that it was an RM2 surcharge on their website, a surcharge of RM5 was mentioned on the printed bills. Now, there is finally a very official document detailing TM’s plans. According to the release, TM is postponing the defaulting of billing to the e-billing system to 1 July 2016 — seven months after the original intended implementation date of January 2016. This means that customers can still continue to receive their printed bill for now, but are strongly encouraged to make the switch as soon as possible. Customers who fail to make the switch by 1 July 2016 will continue to receive their printed bill but be incurred a surcharge of RM2 per month. TM is calling on all their subscribers to make the switch as soon as possible if they don’t want to be forced to pay more. They highlight that there are many benefits to using the e-billing system, from speed (customers can receive their bills within 4 days) to SMS alerts and even the ability to check your bill online (up to 6 months) from anywhere at any time by simply logging on to this  website . To do so, simply update your preferred email address and mobile number by sending an email to help@tm.com.my or visit the nearest TMpoint outlet, or call TM Contact Centre at 100 from your landline. According to TM, over 700,000 out of more than 4.4 million TM residential customers are already on the e-Bill statements. That’s only about 16% of the user base. Do note that this does not affect people who are only subscribed to TM’s telephone services (without broadband). These customers will receive the printed bill for free. [ SOURCE ]"

It has been a good 9-months since the G Tunable Gaming Mouse was introduced and it’s received raved reviews since, leaving us to ask how do you make it better? I mean, it has one of the best DPI (dots per inch) sensors in the market and an a great surface/weight distribution system. That said, they added something that was missing on this mouse – RGB lighting; RGB stands for red, green and blue – making the mouse easily “camouflage-able” in whatever personalised colourway you’d desire. On the surface, aside of stripping the teal coloured accents, it remains the same 11-programmable button mouse. The removable weights are still there, allowing you to make your mouse’s weight configuration to your liking. As far as technology goes, an overhaul usually means a price jump but in this case, it’ll go for the same US$ 80 (RM 354.44) price tag on its predecessor. That’s in terms of pricing in the US but here, the MSRP is quoted at RM 279; although there’s no word on what the new mouse will go for when it arrives locally. For more info, head on over  here ."

Mr Li detailed in the social media status that the smartphone is currently in mass production, merely awaiting orders to let it out of the gates. He also put the rumour of the Mi 5 having a Snapdragon 820 chipset to bed; confirming that Qualcomm’s top processor will indeed be inside. This confirmation serves to reignite the flailing rumours that went flying around in early December, even confusing us in the process following the release of the Redmi Note 3 – like seriously, the Chinese manufacturer chose to put an all-metal frame and fingerprint sensor on their more affordable smartphone line – we’re still left in awe but hey, who doesn’t love a good deal? Redmi Note 3 pictured In spite of getting our bets thrown into the drain, we’d like to think that Xiaomi will match their strategy and utilise metal and a fingerprint sensor on the Mi 5 as well. Leaks apparently make it seem that the device will carry a 5.2-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display – something never seen before on a Mi device – and make use of 4GB of RAM. On paper, having a Snapdragon 820 processor plus that much RAM, we can safely assume it’ll be a beast. The alleged spec sheet also state that it’ll come in either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage; feature a 16-megapixel rear camera and 13-megapixel front sensor; and a fairly large 3,600 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 included.

Priced from RM1,599. One of the biggest thorns in our smartwatch sides has been the fact that  Apple  has yet to bring it’s coveted smartwatch, the  Apple Watch , to our shores. Well, the wait is almost up because Apple is set to put two exclusive Apple Watch Sport designs on sale in Malaysia on February 8. To commemorate the Chinese New Year celebrations, Apple looks to be putting these two “special” models on sale in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This comes after an announcement message appeared briefly on the countries’ corresponding Apple websites before being removed earlier today. The announcement read: 9to5Mac also reports that while the “Buy Now” and “Shop Now” links appeared for a short time on Apple’s website, it looks like the company might have launched the announcement a bit prematurely. It is currently unclear how Apple plans to sell these devices, or if they will be priced at an equally “special” price from the normal Apple Watch Sport models. While Apple officially launched the Watch way back in 2014, the final release of the product was in April the following year. Since then, the availability of the device has slowly trickled into our neighbouring countries. Now it seems our time may be near, though at this point it is still a rumour because there is no official confirmation. That said, this information was sourced from 9to5Mac and MacRumours, both of whom are usually right when it comes to stuff like these. If this launch date holds true, this would mean that Malaysia is one of the last markets to get the Apple Watch — almost an entire year after it was officially released. To make matters worse, this sale is only available until February 22 while supplies last. If you’d like to brush up on the Apple Watch and all of its glory before you decide to purchase one, head on over to our  hands-on review  of the smartwatch. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

As announced at CES, Netflix is virtually everywhere except for China, Crimea, North Korea and Syria. Now you can enjoy binge watching TV shows from the US with having to use a VPN.  Similar to  iflix , you get to watch Netflix anywhere across multiple devices including your PC, mobile device, media boxes and gaming consoles. In terms of subscription, 3 options are available which varies on quality and number of simultaneous streams.  Netflix starts from RM33/month for the basic plan that lets you watch on a single device in standard definition. Moving up the notch is the standard option with HD quality streaming up to 2 devices for RM42/month. For the ultimate experience in Ultra HD, you can go premium for RM51/month and it supports 4 devices. For new subscribers, you can try Netflix free for a month but you’re required to enter your credit card payment details upon signing up. If you do not wish to continue, you are able to cancel the subscription under your account settings.  In terms of connectivity, Netflix  recommends  at least 3.0Mbps for Standard Definition, 5.0Mbps for HD and 25Mbps for UHD quality. By default, the quality is set to auto but you can change this under Playback Settings under “Your Account”. If you’re tight on data quota, Low Quality takes up about 0.3GB/hour while Medium (SD) consumes 0.7GB/hour. On the highest quality setting, it can go up to 3GB/hour for HD and a massive 7GB/hour in UltraHD.  To maximise your home’s 4K TV potential, you’ll probably need to subscribe to a Fibre Broadband plan of at least 30Mbps.  In terms of pricing.

Nikon ’s new addition will make the KeyMission 360 an only child (for now) in their new family of action cameras – probably the one and only that is capable of delivering a 360-degree field of view shot. In a market space dominated by the likes of  GoPro  – as well as other emerging companies entering the party fashionably late, TomTom, Garmin and Sony to name a few – Nikon seems to be riding on the same wave. Being a 4K ready 360-degree capable video camera, the shape it holds is weird, especially when we’ve come accustomed to the looks of GoPros. The frame is pretty much square but this is definitely no cube; two lenses sit on the front and rear of the KeyMission 360 while the exterior sure screams “rugged”. It isn’t all for show either, Nikon claims it’s shockproof up to a 2-metre drop and waterproof up to 30 metres.  It doesn’t surprise us that other influential imaging companies are hot on the heels, as GoPros have been relatively popular since making its inception in the early 2000s. Drones have been hot too, so these two, when used in unison, would probably be one of the biggest leaps for photojournalism and news reporting.   Knowing this, GoPro will soon put out the Karma, a drone and 360-degree camera combo but that’s still in development; you can read about it  here . Nikon enters a new space and despite the forerunners mentioned earlier entering the market much earlier, none of them offer a small (true) 360-degree action camera. With this type of dual-lens 360-degree camera hitting the scene, it might pose a huge question mark for those bulky camera rigs that are used to deliver VR-videos; making these smaller options something you can pocket and go, rather than needing a fully fledged crew to handle a production. The KeyMission 360 along with some nifty dedicated accessories will be out in Spring of this year; no pricing details have been released but more information will be available during Nikon’s CES exhibit scheduled to take place tomorrow.

The Gear S2 in Rose Gold is paired with an Ivory Genuine leather Band, while the Platinum version comes with a Black Genuine Leather Strap. Both are available globally starting in February but there’s no word of its pricing. With an 18 Karat case for Rose Gold, we reckon that Samsung could slap an extra premium on the price tag.

Yes, a Windows 10 device bearing the Galaxy tag and we have all the juicy specs right here. The Galaxy TabPro S will come with a choice of either a Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro operating system, so there is no option for an Android OS of any kind. Up front, the tablet will have a 12-inch FHD+ (2160×1440 pixels) sAMOLED display — the first Windows 10 tablet to have a Super AMOLED screen. On the inside, this massive tablet will be powered by a dual-core Intel Core M processor, clocked at 2.2GHz. paired with 4GB of RAM and either a 128GB or 256GB SSD. Because the device is powered by a Core M processor, it has a fanless design which eliminates that annoying whirring sound. We initially thought that this device would be competition for the  Microsoft Surface 3 , but with these specs (of course depending on the price) it looks to be able to take on even the low spec  Surface Pro 4  with a Core M3 processor. Do note that Samsung did not mention which Core M processor they’re using, only that it is a 6th-gen one. The device will also support 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, WiFi Direct, NFC and Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity. For those on the move, there’s also a 4G LTE (Cat.6) version alongside a WiFi only version. GPS and GLONASS are also supported. For optics, the Galaxy TabPro S will have a 5MP front and rear camera, which isn’t impressive but you don’t want to be that guy taking pictures with your 12″ tablet do you? For video, the cameras will support recording up to an FHD resolution (1920×1080). Powering the components will be a 5,200 mAh battery that Samsung says can last up to 10 hours, and because the tablet sports a USB Type-C port, it will also have fast charging allowing you to top the device up in about 2.5 hours. Since 2-in-1 devices are all the rage right now, the Galaxy TabPro S will come with a keyboard (not sold separately) that looks very much like the old  Surface Pro 3  Type Cover. Unlike the  iPad Pro , this keyboard can actually function as a cover because it adopts a more old-school approach to keyboard attachment. Also, note that it has a touchpad, something that is missing from both  Apple ‘s  Smart Keyboard  and  Google’s Pixel C . For users who want a stylus or more ports, Samsung is offering a Bluetooth Pen and a multi-port adapter (HDMI, USB Type A & C) but are sold separately. Samsung says that the Galaxy TabPro S will be available globally come February 2016 though there is no mention of a recommended retail price. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

Huh? The Taiwanese company isn’t nuts (at least not this time), what they intend to do is release the (second) developer version first. Bridging the gap in the form of this in-between period, the Pre will be prototype Alpha aka the final stage before hitting consumers. Developers out there will be receiving the second-generation development kit that dials in on pushing the envelope and making the least compromises to deliver its experience. Naming it the Pre, HTC hoped that people would understand it literally – Pre as in, pre-production – and it was never supposed to exist. It’s makers and partner Valve felt that if they didn’t, they’d be letting an opportunity go to waste; passing up the front-facing camera that allows users to see what’s really happening outside the VR headset.  This prevents you from stubbing your toe on an edge or bumping yourself face first into a nearby wall, saving us from a lot of accidents in our homes or anywhere else for that matter – HTC calls this room-scale technology “Chaperone” – implementing it properly should allow its users to use it for longer periods without having to remove the headset. Aesthetically it has changed a lot since first being shown off, here are some photos for comparison courtesy of Gizmodo: Vive  Pre headset last year Vive  Pre headset this year Controller last year Controller this year From observations around the tech scene, they mention that the headset is now more ergonomic, making it sit easier on your face. They bumped up the foam and rubber around the Pre as well, ensuring a better fit to go along with a reworked strap system. HTC and Valve have also added that front-facing camera we talked about earlier. While the hand-controllers are revamped to make buttons easier to reach, inbuilt haptic feedback and an included rechargeable batteries. The Vive exists in a space that has Oculus, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft, Fove, Avegant and Razer all in one picture, each vying for a slice of the virtual reality pie that’ll soon exist for consumers to weigh their differences. But something that holds all of them back would be their pricing – none of them cost below US$ 200 – while some (including HTC) have yet to put a number to their products. In retrospect, we don’t expect a VR headset in everyone’s home so soon however you can bet on everyone wanting one. [  SOURCE ,  1 ,  2 ,  3  ]"
Rory Lee,The ASUS Reco Smart camera is more than just a dash-cam,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/the-asus-reco-smart-camera-is-more-than-just-a-dash-cam/,"ASUS dash camera,ASUS portable camera,ASUS Reco Smart camera,ASUS Reco Smart Camera launch,CES 2016,Reco Smart,Reco Smart camera","Asus,Mobile Accessories",2016-01-06,"ASUS  just dropped a video for their new Reco Smart camera that is designed to not only work as a dash cam but also as a portable camera.  With a fast lens, Sony sensor and an interesting design, things are looking pretty good for it. The Reco Smart camera is shaped a lot like a regular camera lens, without the body, which means that it is also quite large, much like  Sony ‘s QX Camera. With that extra real estate though, ASUS can fit a large (and fast) f/1.8 aperture lens which should let it perform well in low-light conditions. ASUS’s camera also has a ‘Parking monitor mode’ that lets the camera detect movement in front of your vehicle and automatically start recording until it detects no further movement for one minute. Coupled with a 150-degree wide-angle lens, this Reco Smart cam is shaping up to be a pretty good dash-cam. In the event of a collision, the built-in three-axis G-sensor triggers the emergency record function. It will then save the recording to the ASUS WebStorage cloud and lock it down so it won’t be deleted by accident. Besides that, the camera can also be programmed to send out an emergency text message to a designated contact. Although there is no mention of the sensor’s megapixel count, the camera supports full-HD 1080p video recording as well as real-time previews and downloads on smart devices via the Reco app. Pairing with your smart device should also be a breeze with NFC One Touch Engage. As the device is WiFi capable (802.11 b/g/n), you also get 500GB of ASUS WebStorage cloud storage for free for one year. When ASUS said that the device could also function as a portable camera, they weren’t kidding because from the looks of things, the Reco Camera is compatible with a wide range of standard camera accessories. Stuff like tripods, monopods and even lens filters (which work with 58mm diameter lenses) should fit with no problems. The only bummer is that the device comes with a tiny 720mAh battery that can only support up to one hour of 1080p video recording with the WiFi turned on. As a comparison, a  GoPro  Hero4 usually averages 1.5 hours of battery life at 1080p recording. You do get a decent amount of kit in the package though, including a microSD card, car charger, dual USB car charger, GPS mount holder and more. A waterproof housing for the camera is also available for purchase. For now, there is no information on availability or pricing. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

The folks at Samsung has officially confirmed that they are adding iOS support for its current  Gear S2  smartwatches. This follows the  earlier rumour  however it is happening only later this year without specific dates. Similar with Android Wear powered smartwatches, the Gear S2 is expected to lose some functionality when it’s paired to an iPhone but it should work with your standard day to day notifications. In the past, Samsung has limited its Gear smartwatches exclusively to Galaxy devices but recognising the need to go mass, they have finally opened up the Gear S2 to work with most Android smartphones. The Gear S2 is their first round smartwatch and it stands out with its rotating bezel that we feel is more intuitive to use than the digital crown on the Apple Watch. The Gear S2 is currently priced at RM1,399 while its Classic version is going for RM1,599. As a comparison, the Apple Watch is priced officially from RM1,599 and that’s for the base aluminium model with a smaller 38mm size. The straps for the Gear S2 are also replaceable and the Classic version lets you swap with any traditional 20mm watch band.  If you’re an Apple iPhone user, would you get an Apple Watch or a Gear S2?

Arif Lee,Huawei’s Mate 8 goes global and it’s coming to Malaysia very soon,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/huaweis-mate-8-goes-global-and-its-coming-to-malaysia-very-soon/,"4G LTE,Android,Android Marshmallow,Annoucement,availability,CES 2016,Consumer Electronics Show 2016,huawei,Huawei CES 2016,Huawei Malaysia,Huawei Mate 8,Kirin 950,Kirin 950 processor,launch,Marshmallow,Mate 8,Phablet,Price,processor,smartphone","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2016-01-06,"Those at Las Vegas were lucky enough to see  Huawei ’s latest 6-inch phablet in the flesh at the company’s CES announcement; previously only released in its native China. And Western markets should be paying attention to the  Mate 8  now since the Chinese manufacturer has already put its name out there with the  Nexus 6P . But the Mate 8 isn’t a Nexus, there’s not a lot of “stock” on its  EMUI  skin, despite running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. The overlaid skin also has a UI that’s comparable to iOS. Putting Huawei devices in a tough spot – top of the line hardware but with software that is “different” – a little too different for some. Looking at what it has under the hood, you’re compelled to believe that this is a flagship. Carrying a home-grown Kirin 950 SoC, this was one of the first devices to equip itself with the aforementioned Octa-core processor.  Four cores are clocked at 2.3GHz while the other four run at 1.8GHz. Quoting Huawei on its  Kirin 950  chipset, they’ve said that the “i5” coprocessor manages power efficiency better and also makes it capable of speech recognition. Together with its main systems, it’ll release (internationally) in two variants: 3GB RAM or 4GB RAM. Seemingly, there’s no information on what the storage specifications are but based on the China release, it’ll likely be 32GB and 64GB respectively. The resolution on this 6-inch beast is a letdown, to be honest. For a screen that big, Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution doesn’t cut it. And once you notice it has a huge 4,000 mAh, you’ll be even more peeved; giving them no excuse to up the resolution, as battery life wouldn’t be a factor. On the outside, it’s the same all-metal design that we’ve (recently) seen Huawei put out. Its front will feature 2.5D curved glass around the display and on the top, an 8-megapixel front camera takes care of all those selfie shots.   Moving to the back, there’s a 16-megapixel Sony IMX298 lens, as well as a rounded fingerprint sensor. As we talked about earlier, it’ll have a big battery but even while being rated 4,000 mAh, Huawei claims a 30-minute charge delivers a full-day of use. Albeit a centrepiece of Huawei’s conference at CES, there was no word on when it’ll hit US stores, if at all.  But here’s the plot twist, it’ll be arriving in Malaysia during the first wave launch in four colour options, Champagne Gold, Moonlight Silver, Space Grey and Mocha Brown. Huawei failed to give a date to this “first wave launch”. As per presentation, Huawei was quoted that the Mate 8 will arrive in 30 countries; you can find a full list at  Android Headlines . Looking at Chinese prices, the phablet could make an RM 1k price jump to:   3,199 RMB (RM 2,118) – 3GB/32GB 
3,699 RMB (RM 2,474) – 4GB/64GB So there’s that to consider if Malaysians were already eager to pick it up. Alternatively, these were the European pricings: €599 (RM 2,818) – 3GB/32GB 
€699 (RM 3,290)  – 4GB/64GB [  SOURCE ,  IMAGE SOURCE  ]"
Arif Lee,Fitbit ups the ante with its fancy-looking Blaze fitness watch,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/06/fitbit-ups-the-ante-with-its-fancy-looking-blaze-fitness-watch/,"Android,Announcement,Blaze,CES 2016,Consumer Electronics Show 2016,FitBit,Fitbit blaze,Fitbit CES,FitBit CES 2016,fitbit surge,fitness tracker,heart rate monitor,HRM,iOS,launch,release,smart fitness tracker,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,Surge,wearable,Windows","Android,Cool stuff,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch,Windows 10,Windows Phone",2016-01-06,"Fitbit  earned the  number one wearable title  last year with nearly 4.4 million wrist companions sold. And while their devices have never been sleek, fancy or elegant, they’re hoping that the latest Blaze might help more people jump into the whole fitness watch scene. But this is not really a smartwatch, by definition. It doesn’t have third-party apps like other smartwatches ( Apple Watch  and  Samsung Gear S2 ) out there. This niche segment that Fitbit hopes to approach could be for those who want to be fitness focused, yet not jump into a whole new world of complications associated with “smartwatches”. It’ll be interesting to see how the masses react to a more fashion-focused fitness tracker/watch, considering how Swiss ( TAG Heuer  and Breitling) makers have also decided to join in. Maybe the days of the analogue are over. Fitbit’s Blaze is going to do what their products do best, tracking fitness. Whether you choose to have it on your wrist 24/7, that’s pretty much up to you but you can rest easy if you decide so; it’ll monitor sleep, count your steps, track your workouts and records your heart rate throughout. If you’re unfamiliar with the whole Fitbit ecosystem, you can read about their other devices  here . The actual device is modular, so the choices of bands/straps will fit pretty much any occasion – coming in the typical Fitbit elastomer, leather and stainless steel options. The brand’s devices have always been squarish, straying away from the traditional watch face but the Blaze is octogonal watch face, so it’s less cube-ish this time. Notably, Fitbit’s latest fitness tracker will feature an LED colour screen – a first for the company. Adding that makes a big change but for some reason they left out inbuilt GPS on Blaze; a key feature that differentiated their top of the line Surge tracker from its lower models. Though, it does have “connected GPS”; a fancy way of saying that you’ll need your smartphone to track distance and map out your route. They probably left this out to keep battery life at a bearable 5-days. Although, we didn’t choose to call it a smartwatch, it does have some form of notifications: call, text and calendar alerts to be precise. You’ll also be able to control your music playback options while doing all your fitness related activities. Most of the specifications are still up in the air but from what we’ve been able to gather, it’ll play nice with iOS, Android and Windows smartphones/tablets, together with PCs too.  The elastomer Fitbit Blaze will retail for US$ 199.95 (RM 875.70) and come in three colours: black, blue and plum.  If you want to go higher up in the looks department, you’ll have to fork out more – an additional US$ 99.95 (RM ) for the leather band and US$ 129.95 (RM ) for the stainless steel band. The new fitness tracker will be for sale internationally in March 2016. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Alongside several interesting features, Lenovo will also be bundling its midrange device with a virtual reality (VR) headset. The Vibe K4 Note’s specifications look good on paper, with it sporting a 5.5-inch full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) IPS panel, which results in a pixel density of 401ppi. The display, which the company claims has a 1000:1 contrast ratio with adjustable colour balance, will be tucked under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC paired with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. For optics, the device will see a 13MP rear shooter with PDAF (Phase Detection Auto Focus) and a fast f/2.2 aperture. Helping the device out with low-light shots is a two-tone LED flash to the right of the camera module. For selfies, the phone unsurprisingly sports a 5MP front-facing camera. What is surprising is the fact that the device will feature a pair of front-facing stereo Dolby Atmos speakers, something that’s missing even on most flagship devices. What’s more, this mid-range device also sports a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back just below the primary camera (my personal favourite location), something that is still relatively rare at this end of the market. Powering everything will be a quick charge enabled 3,300 mAh battery that is supposed to deliver 265 hours of 3G standby time and 22 hours of 3G talk time. The device also comes with dual-SIM support, both of which have support for 4G LTE. The device will run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Lenovo’s Vibe UI skin on top, though we do hope that it will get a Marshmallow update in the near future. The reason they bundled the smartphone with a VR headset is so that users can take advantage of Lenovo’s TheaterMax technology which converts regular content into immersive VR content. While we don’t know how “immersive” TheaterMax will end up being, Lenovo seems pretty confident in it, leaving the final judgement to time itself. Lenovo’s mid-ranger will go on a flash sale on Amazon India on January 19 at INR11,999 (around RM783) for just the device, while the VR bundle will cost INR13,299 (around RM868). Note that for the first few flash sales, the device will only be sold in the VR bundle, but priced at a discounted INR12,499 (around RM816). No information on whether this device will make it to Malaysia is present at the time of this article’s writing. It is important to point out that the predecessor, the Note K3, is  available on DirectD  at RM599. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  3 ]"

Be it scary or adorable, we’ve come to know that they play an integral role despite not actually “being” human. Across our screens, we’ve seen lovable and iconic characters like WALL-E, Iron Giant, C-3PO, R2-D2 and most recently,  BB-8 . Though advancements in technology as finally gifted us our own personal droid; hats off to Sphero, they made miniature BB-8s real. But as of today, the makers have just shown off a prototype wearable at  CES 2016  that takes it a step further, allowing you to control your BB-8 with the Force! Initially, you were able to command your BB unit to do your bidding through your smartphone and while still super cool, who doesn’t love “Force” gestures? Sphero’s Force Band (final name not decided) will be an add-on wrist device and come Q3 of this year, we’re likely to see production units hit the shelves. Those who’ve already purchased a BB-8 won’t have to worry, as it’ll work with any existing unit and you won’t have to fork out any money – other than the moolah you splash on the actual Force Band. Move your BB unit at the wave of the hand, and focus your Force powers by making “pulling” and “pushing” gestures. The Verge goes further in depth, giving us a low down on how to control the droid but basically your hand will be the ignition, wheel, acceleration and brakes. Sphero is still ironing out its new wearable and mainly everything shown is in its early stages and things may change as they continue to work with Lucasfilm and Disney. Although, the manufacturer did mention that more details will be out next month during Toy Fair, so maybe pricing will be announced then. Special Battle-Worn Jakku Edition on the left, regular version on the right Once Fall of 2016 hits, we’ll also see a Battle-Worn BB-8 that has a more worn down exterior to reflect its time roughing it out on Jakku but inside it’s still the same charming droid we’ve come to love. For purchase in Malaysia, you can pick-up your own BB-8 droid at Machines for RM 849. Better start practising your Force gestures now eh? [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 will get features you wanted so badly on the S6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/05/samsung-galaxy-s7-micro-sd-waterproof-larger-battery/,"Android,battery capacity,microSD,microSD Slot,MWC 2016,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Battery,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Samsung Galaxy S7 Specs,Samsung Galaxy S7 Waterproof,Waterproof","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2016-01-05,"Samsung is expected to launch its new  flagship smartphones  next month during  MWC 2016 . As we inch closer towards its launch day, serial leakster,  @evleaks  has dropped more details on Samsung’s next big duo.  The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge had opened a new chapter for Samsung with its premium glass and metal design, along with top specs that hold well to this very day. Of course, there are many that frown upon its compromises. It was their first flagship to not have a removable battery and most critical of all, it lacks an expandable microSD slot. If you were disappointed by the Galaxy S6, there’s a lot to look forward to on the upcoming model. According to @evleaks, the new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will finally offer a microSD slot. Like the current S6, both models will be offered with either 32GB and 64GB storage options, which in Malaysia we are likely to receive the smallest option of just 32GB.  This would be good news for those taking loads of pictures and 4K videos as the device is alleged to support microSD cards up to 200GB. This reaffirms an earlier “ insider source ” that Samsung is finally bringing back the microSD slot to its latest flagship.  With each new model, the Galaxy S lineup has always seen an increase of battery capacities. However on the Galaxy S6, it was downsized from 2,800mAh on the Galaxy S5 to just 2,550mAh (2,600mAh on the S6 edge). Fortunately, the new processor and energy efficient  Universal Flash storage  were good at maximising every mAh of power.  The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are alleged to receive 3,000mAh and 3,600mAh capacity batteries respectively, which is a huge jump. That’s like fitting a Galaxy Note battery into a smaller device, and hopefully this could translate to more than 24 hours of usage.  Wireless Charging will still be the star of the show and Samsung will likely to support fast wireless charging for the new flagship duo as it did with the Galaxy Note5. Charging an S7 is reported to take about 2 hours wirelessly while the S7 edge will take slightly longer at 2.2 hours.   First introduced on the Galaxy S5, the S7 is said to be getting water and dust resistance with an IP67 rating. This is similar with the Galaxy S5 which in theory can be submerged up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. Even if you don’t go to the pool, having water resistance is a good feature to have especially for those unexpected moments. Even word has it that the folks at Cupertino  are working  to make its upcoming iPhone waterproof.  If Samsung is doing it, it better be a cap-less design without those clumsy flap covers.  The Galaxy S7/S7 edge will be running on their latest Exynos 8890 processor but there will be a Qualcomm-powered version for selected markets that runs on a Snapdragon 820 processor. Expect them to come with 4GB of RAM and has support for faster Cat 9 4G LTE.  In terms of screen size, the standard S7 is likely to retain the same compact 5.1″ Quad HD display while the S7 edge is rumoured to be either a larger 5.5 or 5.7 incher. To have a 5.7″ smartphone at this time of the year  doesn’t make any sense  as it would cannibalise its own S6 edge+ that was launched not too long ago. Camera wise, the new flagships will get a smaller pixel count of 12MP instead of its current 16MP shooter. However, it is compensated with faster f/1.7 lens versus f/1.9 for better low-light performance. With a smaller BRITECELL camera module, the new S7 could have a flat and flush back design without the protruding camera hump.   Are you excited now? MWC 2016 is happening on 22nd February 2016 and Samsung would normally announce their latest Galaxy S model a day earlier. [  SOURCE   VIA  ]"

First up is a glorious fixed-wing UAV from Parrot, the very same people who brought you the Bebop 2 — a powerful little quadcopter drone that is allegedly windproof up to 40mph (that’s about 64 kph). With the Disco, Parrot are looking to shake their lineup up with this foam-plastic fixed-wing drone that has automated takeoff and landing. That means you can just toss it in the air and the drone will start flying though it does need a little bit of room to get it climbing. The Disco, with it’s single propeller and detachable wings, can hit speeds of up to 50mph (around 80kph) and stay flying for about 45 minutes on a single charge. There is also an ultrasound camera mounted at the bottom of the drone that helps it land autonomously. Well, more like crash autonomously if we’re looking at the teaser footage. Like the Bebop 2, you can control the Disco with Parrot’s Skycontroller or plot a flight plan and have the drone do the flying itself. The drone also has a “return home” function that does exactly what the name suggests. Mounted at the front is the same eye-like 14-megapixel fisheye lens camera Parrot mounts on the Bebop 2, so it will likely feature the same digital panning and stability options as well. While ditching the quadcopter design lets you fly more realistically (especially with FPV goggles), there will inevitably be drawbacks. The drone, for example, loses its ability to hover and takeoff vertically, making it less ideal for filming. It will also inevitably be less stable and manoeuvrable than a quadcopter. Upside? Y0u can fly, turn and pitch like an actual plane. COOL. Despite their claims, The Verge points out that Parrot aren’t the first to introduce a ready-to-fly fixed-wing drone as there are already several small fixed-wing drones in the market. Though we do think the Disco is one of the best looking fixed-wing drones out there. Or almost out there, since it’s still a prototype. Parrot does plan to make this available to consumers within this year so that’s something to look forward to. [ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,You can add “MagSafe” to your MacBook and USB Type-C Laptops,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/05/you-can-add-magsafe-to-your-macbook-and-usb-type-c-laptops/,"BreakSafe Magnetic USB Type C Cable,CES 2016,Griffin,Griffin USB Type C,Magnetic Release Cable,Magnetic USB Type C Cable,magsafe,USB Cable,USB Type-C cable",Mobile Accessories,2016-01-05,"The MacBook Air and MacBook Pro uses a MagSafe charging connector that latches to your laptop with the help of magnets. It is an interesting safety feature as it disconnects if someone tripped over your cable, avoiding the risk of dragging your laptop to the ground. When Apple introduced the new  ultra-thin MacBook , it was ditched in favour of the all-new USB Type-C. This is supposedly the future standard of connectivity, allowing you to deliver power, data and even high-resolution video on a single cable.  Sadly that means you’re stuck with an old-school cable design like other gadgets. If you want to restore that MagSafe feature of old, cable maker Griffin finally has a solution for you. Simply called as BreakSafe, the new magnetic USB cable works essentially like the MagSafe that came as standard with previous MacBook models. It is fairly easy to release and it will automatically disconnect when there’s excessive pressure. On one end, you get a fixed USB Type-C connector that goes into your power adapter, while the other end has two pieces, with the small stub that stays permanently in your MacBook port.  The cable is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long and the magnetic connector is about 12.8mm deep. On their  online store , it is listed as coming soon with the retail price tag of US$39.99 (about RM173). As comparison, the original USB Type-C cable (2 metres) for the MacBook is  going for  RM139. If you’re looking for a sleeker alternative, there’s  Znaps  that debut on  KickStarter . This isn’t a cable but a two-piece connector head that gives you a “MagSafe” and a reversible feature for your existing Lightning, Micro-USB and USB Type-C cables. A set for Lightning and Micro-USB costs US$18.00 (about RM78) while USB Type-C costs US$24.00 (about RM104). Individual connectors and adapters are sold separately so you can “MagSafe” your entire device collection if required. You can  pre-order now  and they will ship by end of this month.

But with doors, windows and grills, one can only do so much to protect their own home. Let’s face the facts, break-ins happen all over the world though it doesn’t hurt to have some sort of surveillance system around your compound. Meet the Netatmo Presence, a smart outdoor security camera released at  CES 2016 . Wait, another “smart” home-monitoring system that has a motion detector? Well yeah but this one can identify the differences between a person, animal and car. The brand isn’t a stranger to the home-monitoring scene; before launching Presence, the “ Welcome ” indoor camera had this revolutionary facial recognition technology – letting you always put a name to known faces. Presence doesn’t go as far but the ability to distinguish a person, animal and car is already a feat in itself. Connecting to your home Wi-Fi network to send you real-time push notifications of what it has been seeing, it’ll buzz you on your designated device if it notices a person moving around the vicinity, an animal running about or a car pulling up to the driveway – proceeding to show you a video recap of it happening.   Able to detect people/animals/cars up to 20 metres, the camera also allows users to pinch-to-zoom to ensure you manage to identify the culprits in your video recording. It’ll be interesting to see how capable the software is and if any costumes/hoods or etc can fool it into not “recognising” a person. Having Presence on your porch will definitely help when you’re expecting a valuable package; keep an eye on gardeners and handymen; or when you’re too preoccupied to notice the doorbell going off. It makes perfect sense since we’re always on our smartphones anyways, the push notification should be seen quickly. As a fixed outdoor camera, it’ll obviously be working during the night-time but once the sun goes down, the camera kicks into infra-red mode – if you want it to – otherwise the floodlight that sits above the lens will be mighty useful. Personalise Presence and its corresponding app by going through its notification settings and allow it to continuously record when a person is detected. The 4-megapixel smart camera shoots in Full HD (1920 x 1080) and has a 100-degree angle field of view. Storage is done internally and that means if you don’t get to your recording fast enough, someone could easily destroy the camera before you realised. Sitting inside an aluminium shell that’s IP66 certified, you’ll mount the 50 x 200 x 110mm unit with the included mounting kit. In terms of the floodlight specifications, it’ll be a dimmable 12W LED unit with IR night vision detection up to 15 metres. Access your Netatmo camera through its free app that runs both on iOS (8 minimum) and Android (4.3 minimum).  From what we’re familiar with, other smart home security options require you to pay for their monthly based app subscriptions and services, so it’s pretty neat that you’ll save some money using Netatmo. Presence is slated to make its way to homes around the world sometime during Fall 2016 while no pricing information has been released. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Now, serial leakster  @evleaks  has published images of what looks to be the tab in question. According to him, the device will be called the Galaxy TabPRO S, a name which perplexes us because historically,  Samsung  devices carrying the Galaxy badge have always been Android powered. The TabPRO S though should bear the  Ativ  badge since it looks very much like it is going to be a Windows 10 machine. A possible explanation for this is that the device could either be a dual boot system or come in two variants, much like the  Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 . Then again, we don’t know if these are official pictures or not, so take them with a grain of salt. The tablet looks to come with a keyboard attachment as well, but since it is supposed to be a massive 12-inches, we do hope that Samsung finds a more elegant solution to fold their keyboard than  Apple  did with their  iPad Pro ‘s  Smart Keyboard . That said, the keyboard will likely mean that this tablet should be marketed more towards the productivity side, much like their previous  Galaxy Tab Pro . This would put it in direct competition with  Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4  and the  Apple iPad Pro . As a spec recap, the Samsung Galaxy TabPRO S is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400 pixels stretched out over the 12-inch screen. On the inside, the device is said to be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM. Some have also indicated that the tablet may come with an  S Pen , which could greatly increase productivity when coupled with a full Windows 10 experience.

How? With their annual development challenge of course! This year, the participating parties are offering a USD100,000 (RM434,000) grand prize to the team that can build the best application for launching a drone from a moving vehicle as part of a search-and-rescue mission. Although we’ve seen drones being launched for rescue missions in the past, none of them have been launched from a car in motion. This is an issue because the conditions of a disaster are never the same, often needing the rescue team to stay on the move to avoid getting caught up in it themselves. So, the participants are tasked with launching and landing a drone from the bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck. Here’s the full timeline of the DJI SDK Developer Challenge: In certain parts of the world, drones bring about more fear than anything else, though it’s amazing to see that there are (obvious) pros in utilising them for aid drop-offs and search-and-rescue missions; lessening the risk of rescuers by putting drones out there instead. And let’s not forget the use of these drones by photojournalist worldwide, capturing civil unrest in states observing media lockdowns. Besides holding competitions to save the world, DJI has also updated their existing Phantom and Inspire drone series. While DJI’s uber cool Inspire 1 gets a minor colour update (it now comes in black), they’ve added a 4K camera to the Phantom 3, a feature only available on the Phantom 3 Professional in the past.

Not only it is super fast with transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, it is also capable of pushing more power and it can even replace your existing HDMI cables as well. As the one connector to rule them all, the new reversible port will be a common sight in upcoming smartphones, tablets and laptops.  To be in the forefront of this new standard, Acer has announced at CES 2016, the World’s first monitors to support USB Type-C. The H7 monitor series lets you connect your smartphone or laptop onto a bigger screen, while allowing you to transfer files and charge the device simultaneously. This basically sounds like a monitor with a built-in  Microsoft Display Dock .   The Acer H7 series isn’t entirely new and its  existing HDMI/DVI/DisplayPort  lineup employs the same classy look that’s being held up by a premium crafted brushed metal stand. It gets a ZeroFrame design that’s wrapped up in aluminium. There are 2 models available – 25″ and 27″, both of which boast WQHD resolution of 2560×1440 with 100% sRGB colour gamut reproduction.  The monitors come with built-in speakers, that’s assisted with DTS Sound and Acer TrueHarmony enhancements. To protect your eyes, it also gets a Blue Light Filter to reduce eye fatigue over extended usage. For backward compatibility with older devices, the new H7 monitors also support HDMI 2.0. The Acer H7 series is priced from 499 Euros (about RM2325), and it is expected to go on sale globally in February. Also announced at CES 2016 is the Acer R1 – The World’s Thinnest Monitor under 7mm. It is virtually bezel-less with its ZeroFrame design, allowing seamless viewing when paired with multiple monitors. The Acer R1 monitor series pushes Full HD resolution and it comes in either 21.5″, 23″, 23.8″, 25″ and 27″ sizes. Price starts from 139 Euros (about RM648) and it will be available globally starting this month."

Having seen a barrage of R series smartphones ( R7 ,  R7 Plus ,  R7s ), the Chinese smartphone maker will be introducing an all new F series that’s focused on “premium-quality mobile photography”. According to OPPO, the F series will be a core product for 2016. It promises impressive specs and eye-catching style with an amazing price. So could we be looking at an affordable “Lumia Pureview” alternative? At the moment, OPPO has a photography-centric N series that offers a rotating camera module on the OPPO  N1  and  N3 .  From the teaser image above, the F series appears to have unibody metal design and it comes with rounded corners and edges as opposed to having squarish looks like its current R series. The side does look like an iPhone 6/6s with its power and SIM tray slot switched places. In terms of specs, don’t expect it to be a top notch device like its Find series. The OPPO F series will be a mid-ranger which is unlikely to be powered by Qualcomm’s newer Snapdragon 810/820 family of processors.  The first model would be called the OPPO F1 and it could be launched in Malaysia sometime this month. If they are looking to push photography in a mid-range segment, the phone to beat would be the  Lenovo Vibe Shot  that’s priced at RM1,399. That comes with a 16MP sensor with OIS, Laser AutoFocus and a triple LED flash."

Earlier, we reported that we could potentially see a  bigger Samsung Galaxy S7 edge  to better differentiate it from the regular S7, but now, it seems that the device could be even bigger than we initially thought. In a recent post , SamMobile brought attention to a leaked image of what could be a variant of the Samsung Galaxy S7, model number SM G93, sporting a 5.7-inch QHD display. While there have been rumours going around about a potential Samsung Galaxy S7+, SamMobile believes that this will likely be the S7 edge instead. We highly doubt Samsung would cannibalise their popular recent flagship and risk their consumers getting pissed at them, just so they can be “radical”. It’s very unlikely that they would  pull a Xiaomi . Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, the picture also reveals another interesting specification: The camera module. According to the picture, the S7 (or S7 edge or S7+) looks to feature a 12.2-megapixel rear camera coupled with a 5-megapixel front shooter. What’s interesting is the drastic drop in megapixel count for the rear camera, down from 16MP, in a 2016 device. This is in-line with an earlier rumour that the device would sport a 12MP large pixel sensor, though it doesn’t match Samsung’s  other camera technology reveal . At their Investor’s Forum last year, Samsung unveiled the BRITECELL camera technology, which utilises tiny one micron pixels which are “the smallest pixel for slim smartphone”. If Samsung were to use these small pixels and also drop pixel count, then they would really have to have something up their sleeve to help the sensor cope with low-light photography. The image also reveals that the device will have a Snapdragon 820 processor with an Adreno 530 GPU mated with 4GB of RAM, which is, unsurprising. In any case, these are only rumours and Samsung could just be pulling a fast one, using multiple prototypes to mislead leaksters. Although you should probably take this with a grain of salt, this does give us a lot to be excited about for 2016’s smartphones. [ SOURCE ]"

As far as we can tell, seems the US market will have their hands on a Huawei tablet and possibly a smartwatch on the 5th of January. Appearing on their official Weibo account, the first image looks to be a thin metal-clad tablet/smartphone of sorts, with Gizmochina claiming it’ll be the honor X3 tablet. We’d think that it’s more likely be a Huawei X3 since they’ve kept the X-line for the higher-end brand. In the same image, you’ll see speaker grills on the device; given the placement, we’re going to assume that it’s a tablet as well. There’s also a wine glass in a form of a velvet cloth-like material with the words “rhythm x entertainment” leaving us to believe it’ll be multi-media focused in terms of features. Given the timing of the Kirin 950 chipset release, many have pointed out that the tech conglomerate will utilise their new top of the line SoC on the X3 but that’s mere speculation for now. The other device they casually let out of the bag seems to be a watch and based on  earlier reports , this could be the smaller version of the Huawei Watch. According to the makers, this new watch will be a rounder smartwatch – we have no idea what that means. Take a look at the Huawei Watch and tell us if you could make this “rounder”. Similar to the other photo, the second image has two words: technology and fashion. The “watch face” used also seems more feminine than usual, hinting towards something more female focused. Chinese tech companies have teased devices before, with Xiaomi being the more transparent out of the two; letting us see everything we need to make our own assumptions. We credit co-founder/President of Xiaomi, Lin Bin for showing “teasers” of their own products. Whatever the circumstance, mark your calendars for the 6th of January 2:00 am (Malaysian time), Huawei is going to put on a show. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"

You’d hardly expect to see anything about “print” there since we’re talking about the digital age but LG hopes to bring back the newspaper; just in a way you never thought possible. This was what they showed off during 2014 Releasing a beta of their flexible OLED display, it looks like the Korean manufacturer wants to take these screens seriously and we can expect this technology to be on their products soon enough. The Verge points out that similar concept displays have already been showcased by other screen-makers but they’ve yet to really put this tech out there. Inching closer to making their now curved screens to bend, flex and roll, LG aims to see this technology make its way into homes by wrapping around your walls, fixtures and furniture. They’re so serious that they’ll be showing off a 25-inch “curved” screen working in a… car. Probably influenced by Tesla’s center dashboard screen but that’s a 17-inch display. Those at LG’s CES showcase will have the privilege of seeing these rolled-up newspaper-esque screens, that plus a 55-inch TV that is as thin as paper. But to be that thin, the electronics will live outside, obviously. Meanwhile, LG will also put their first 8K TVs on the show floor. When we say 8K, we’re talking about a 7680 x 4320 resolution and while Malaysia is still stuck in 1080p land for subscription based TV services (Astro & HyppTV).

What needs? Well according to the people behind the Infant Cries Translator app, it could only one of four things. Created by a team from the National Taiwan University Hospital of Yunlin, they claim that this app will be able to distinguish the sounds made when a newborn is howling away; telling you why in the process.  How it works is the app will record a 15-second clip of the crying noises, analysis the frequencies of acoustic variation and compare it to an online database. Dr Chen Si-da and Chang Chuan-yu lead the show and they’ve managed to get the app to work 92% of the time, telling those using the app that their baby is either hungry, sleepy, in pain or needs a diaper change. That 92% has some caveats though, the accuracy of the app diminishes as the baby gets older: The researchers hypothesise that once the baby reaches six months, it’ll be almost pointless to rely on the app as he/she will be more receptive of the environment around them. And mainly as humans develop, they get more complicated – we can attest to that. Yet, this could be the app every soon-to-be parents will need when it comes to tending to their babies, especially for first-time parents. Learning as it goes, the Infant Cries Translator, will constantly update its database by taking results from babies around the world and it’ll allow parents to personalise their “results” by adding their own feedback to the learning algorithm. We’re sure parents reading this now want to know where to get the app: The screenshots of the app being used on the two app stores are shown in Mandarin but the Apple App Store lists support in English and Japanese as well. And don’t expect this app to solve all your problems, it’s just another tool to help identify why your baby is crying. There’s also a probability that cause of tears don’t match the “reason” the app tells you, so a pediatrician or a child psychologist might always be handy.

That, or your three-man killstreak in Call of Duty. Now though, these UAVs — or drones — are more commonly associated with fancy camera equipment you can use to film your cat climbing up a tree. Or sick drag race vids. We’d go with the cat though because we all know cats rule the internet. In a short period of time, drones have intergrated seamlessly into our lives, with many using them for a variety of purposes. They have been used to advance the production capability of movies, TV series and Internet videos. They have also been crucial for the development of photojournalism, allowing access into locations previously too precarious for photographers. Our boys in blue are also  launching a “drone unit” to facilitate surveillance . 2016 looks to take drones to greater heights, especially with big players stepping in to push it forward. Before I drone on about their history, here are some cool drone developments we’re definitely looking forward to."

If the current watchfaces for the  Gear S2  doesn’t tickle you fancy, why not make one on your own?  Samsung has just released its Gear Watch Designer, a designing tool that allows you to create watchfaces without complex programming. If you’re already a designer you can get started immediately with its familiar Adobe Flash-like interface.  For first time users, it looks pretty straight forward and you can customise your own background, hour markers, hand design and overlay text or elements. For an added touch of creativity, you can throw in additional conditions like showing a sunny background during the day and a moon background during the night. This can be extended further based on steps taken, activities performed and even your current battery levels. You could also add your own animation using a PNG sequence, which can be used as a watchface element.  Once you’re done, the tool helps you to publish your watchface straight to the Gear Store that’s accessible by other Gear users. The Gear Watch Designer works with Windows and Mac computers, on a machine that has at least dual-core 2GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, 1GB of available disk space, minimum 1280×1024 display and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.8 or above.

So, what’s going to be the next big thing in 2016? It looks like the sky is the limit for  Samsung . In a patent application just released by the US patent office, the Korean manufacturer is going all out with a crazy mobile device concept that combines a foldable body with a flexible display, and a built-in projector that can project hologram images. This is of course only a patent application so it’s too early to say if we’ll see a similar device being released this year, not all the tech in one device, at least. You might see Samsung expanding its range of flexible display devices, and it’s not the first time they stuffed a projector into a smartphone (remember the  Galaxy Beam ?). Released in 2010, the Galaxy Beam is a novel idea that was probably ahead of its time but today with video on demand and mobile content steaming being a big thing, a phone with a built in projector wouldn’t be such a bad idea.

It  even helped save a life . The problem is that unless you’re OK with Google Cardboard or other cardboard-like VR goggles, a standalone mobile phone VR headset — like the  Samsung Gear VR  — is quite pricey. Thankfully we can always count on China to produce more affordable options and with FiresVR, proper smartphone VR gear could become easily accessible to everyone. Dubbed the “ Xiaomi  of China’s VR industry”, FiresVR is looking to shake up the pricing of quality VR headsets with its new JiDome-1. Although China has produced many cardboard-like VR pieces in the country, the JiDome-1 is the first “serious” VR product that can be compared to the likes of the Gear VR. The JiDome-1 has a high-precision 9-axis gyroscope and proximity sensor as well as redefined weak interaction buttons. It also has a built-in air-cooling system with a balanced cooling efficiency and working noise. This cooling system will hopefully work well to keep your device cool and stave away moisture or fogging. While the Gear VR is only compatible with Samsung devices, this JiDome-1 is compatible with a variety of Android smartphones as long as they meet the design requirements. For now, it is already compatible with 30% of all Android devices but FiresVR wants to push it to exceed 50% compatibility in 2016. As a proverbial cherry on top of the icing, the device is currently being sold at RMB199 (around RM131.60) which is a whole lot cheaper than what the  Gear VR goes for . There is a catch, though: When it goes on sale in Q1 of 2016, it will only be available to developers, but it is expected to reach consumers in the second quarter of 2016. Because of that, a consumer price has not yet been released. If you can’t wait that long, there’re always more options for VR headsets, head on over to our  gadget gift guide  for more information.

Wang, who was a migrant worker and mother of two was walking in the middle of the road before the incident. However, as she was too preoccupied with her device, she didn’t notice when she gradually began walking towards the edge of the water. Online surveillance footage shows Wang struggling for over a minute before she disappeared from the surface of the water. Her body was discovered after her husband Yang spotted her shoe floating on the river when he went looking for her the next morning. Although the river was only chest-deep, the sludge at the riverbed can cause people to slip and fall. This incident has served as a wake-up call to the Chinese public as netizens took to the social media, calling for people to exercise caution when using phones. We’d like to say that this is the first tragedy caused by phubbing (snubbing someone in favour of your smartphone), but that just isn’t the case. It used to be “don’t drive and text”, now it needs to also be “don’t walk and use your phone”. You might think, “oh that’s not me, I only use it at the dinner table!”. What people don’t realise is that everything starts somewhere. Using them initially to avoid socially awkward situations can often lead to a reliance on the device and we all know where that leads. An Ohio State University researcher discovered that the number of pedestrian deaths has dramatically increased over the past few years and many of which were caused by telephone distractions. The figure is expected to double by 2015. Be mindful when using your device. It’s perfectly fine if you post that tweet an hour or even a day later.

With more selfies taken each day, Apple is still reluctant of putting any form of selfie beautification features into its camera ap. Most smartphone these days, especially from China are equipped with selfie enhancing features that automatically smoothes your skin with some fine touches to your eyes. This trend has also caught on with mainstream brands including Samsung, Lenovo and even Sony.  The Microsoft Selfie app is pretty straightforward. Just snap a picture or take an existing one, and it will automatically apply the necessary effects to make you look better. The selfie enhancement takes into consideration your age, gender, skin tone and lighting which is close to Xiaomi’s camera app. If you remembered, Microsoft had experimented with this Machine Learning feature on its  How old do I look  website.  If the selfie pic isn’t good enough, you can still tweak the levels and select additional filters like you do on Instagram. You can tap on the compare button to compare the before and after effects. The app is currently only  available  for iOS users. This isn’t the first time Microsoft had made a selfie app as they had developed a  Lumia version  for Windows Phone.

Rory Lee,Apple gets sued for rolling out iOS 9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/iphone-4s-users-sue-apple-for-ios-9/,"apple,Apple iPhone 4s,apple sued,apple users sue apple,class action lawsuit,iOS,iOS 9,iPhone 4S","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-30,"They say a king is nothing without his people. A tree, nothing, without its roots. A product, nothing, without its consumers. So what happens when a smartphone manufacturer gets slapped with a class action lawsuit filed by the very people who used to preach their excellence? Draaaama! More than a hundred infuriated  iPhone 4s  owners have filed a lawsuit against  Apple , claiming USD5 million (around RM21.5 million) in damages, accusing them of significantly slowing down their devices with the new  iOS  9 update. The lawsuit was filed with a New York district court, though no hearings have been set at this time. According to plaintiff Chiam Lerman and several others, the new update slowed the device down so much that it interfered with day-to-day usage. It seems that after upgrading, both first and third-party applications exhibited delayed launch times, slow response to touchscreen input and other problems. Overall performance was also affected by freezes and crash events. They also accuse Apple of engaging in deceptive trade practices and false advertising by proclaiming that the update is compatible with legacy smartphones dating back to the iPhone 4s models. The lawsuit also claims that Apple were well aware of iOS 9’s negative impacts on the iPhone 4s but went ahead with the marketing campaign anyway. The campaign advertised faster performance, enhanced security, longer battery life among other enticing features. To make matters worse, the company’s advertisements, website, and iOS page did not have any warning of potential compatibility issues for older devices. Apparently the complaint went after Apple’s iOS system itself, because when faced with a sluggish and slow device, it is more likely that the average Apple user would upgrade to a new iOS product instead of branching out. The reason being that transferring information across devices within the same ecosystem is much easier. Plus there is also the familiarity factor. It isn’t too surprising that a new iOS update would slow down older devices because each new update is designed to take advantage of the hardware from the recent models. This includes a host of new features and improvements that an older device may not have even dreamt was possible, much less have support for it. Apple has been in this situation before, back in 2011, where plaintiffs complained that iOS 4 turned their iPhone 3G into “iBricks”. That case was tossed out a year later and it seems likely that this lawsuit will suffer the same fate. One of the main arguments in the iOS vs Android war was that Apple always pushed new updates, even to old devices such as the iPhone 4s while Android devices have a realistic lifespan of 2 years. After 2 years, it is very unlikely that your Android device would be getting any updates from its manufacturer. Apple fans argued that this was because Android was so fragmented, with so many different manufacturers making so many different versions of the Android OS. iOS isn’t the same because everything was unified under one banner. That said, there is an exception to this  Android  dilemma: The  Nexus  devices. Nexus smartphones tend to receive OS updates much quicker and for longer than most other devices. But unlike what’s happening to these unfortunate iPhone 4s users, each Android update usually improves the performance of older devices due to improved optimisation of the OS. This brings Apple users to what looks like a difficult decision. Do you update your OS to get new features and better security at the risk of sluggish performance? Or do you stick to what already works and brave potential security risks? Let us know in the comments below. If you’re as frustrated as these users and think Apple does this on purpose so that people will be forced to buy a new iPhone, don’t hesitate to drop your opinion in the comment box too!

Rory Lee,Facebook has been messing with you on purpose,http://www.soyacincau.com/2016/01/05/facebook-has-been-messing-with-you-on-purpose/,"Facebook,facebook app android,facebook app crashing,facebook app crashing android,facebook experiment,facebook social experiment,google,Google Play Store,Play Store","Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Rumour Mill",2016-01-05,"What’s your morning routine like? You probably wake up, brush your teeth, take a dump, shower, change and head down for a cup of your favourite wake-me-up drink while you catch up on your social media feed —  Facebook , for instance. Unless you’re me, then that all changes depending on how many times I hit the snooze button. Facebook could probably be your favourite social media platform. Heck, you’re probably reading this article because it popped up on your Facebook feed. Now, what if I told you that your favourite social media platform was secretly experimenting on you? According to a report by The Verge, it appears that Facebook had secretly experimented on its Android mobile users, crashing their apps intentionally, “selectively disconnecting” them from their Facebook applications for hours on end. Why? Well, apparently it was done to prepare for the possibility of  Google   removing the Facebook application from their Play Store  for competitive reasons. They wanted to prepare for a future where users might have to resort to downloading the Facebook application from a source outside of the Google  Play Store . Despite the fact that Facebook is one of the Play Store’s biggest application developers, there is a looming threat that the social network could bypass Google’s services altogether. The tests were allegedly conducted to see how far they could go to get Android users to abandon their platform altogether. The results? “People never stopped coming back.” According to a person familiar with the tests, those who were locked out of their application defaulted to the mobile web browser version of Facebook, rather than abandoning the application. Are you surprised? We weren’t. Right now, there is simply no alternative to Facebook and what the social media platform offers, so it seems only natural that users would find any means possible to access the site. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back. The only problem this presents is that like all tyrants, once people give Facebook this “absolute power”, the social media giant can afford to push more boundaries than otherwise ethically possible because they know you will always come back. Although this was supposedly a one-time experiment conducted years ago, this isn’t the first social experiment Facebook undertook. Yes, we’re talking about the controversy in 2014 where Facebook altered the content on users’ News Feeds to see if it would change their moods. Information surfaced last year that Facebook bombarded several users’ News Feeds with sad and depressing content to see if they were less likely to visit the site if it made them sad. The experiment was so controversial that even the editor behind the study was “ creeped out “, questioning if the results of the study were actually worth all the backlash. What most people don’t realise — or choose to turn a blind eye on — is that social experimenting on the Internet is nothing new. Pretty much every website has done it to some extent. The question then becomes whether you know you’re being experimented on or not. Perhaps what makes what Facebook did so painful was that it felt personal on some level because these were people’s personal feeds. Privacy settings exist for a reason right?

It’ll be the Korean maker’s first ever all-metal smartphone too, according to a source involved in the organisation. The dominos have started to fall since the day before, as an image of a supposed camera setup of LG’s latest smartphone was leaked but we’ll hold that for later. LG V10 shown Apparently the G5 will take some elements from the V10, as well as the older G-series that it hopes to successfully replace. That won’t be all since a new device should come with new features – unless you’re HTC and Sony. Now onto what specs we can expect on the LG G5. As mentioned  earlier , it’ll be a metal unibody case and it’s purported to carry a 5.3-inch display capable of Quad HD (2560 x 1440) resolution.  Why did they shave off 0.2-inches? That’s to make way for the secondary “ticker” display that has been shown on another LG device: the V10. We talked about what the ticker display does  here . Besides that, LG will allegedly reduce battery capacity to only 2,800mAh, though the efficiency of the processor underneath the G5 will be the main factor when its comes to battery life; all signs point towards a Snapdragon 820 processor, while the G5 is said to have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The ticker display might help with battery life too, being the only screen that lights up instead of the main display when notifications come in. This could mean that LG’s new device could be thinner than its predecessor but we’ll have to wait and see if that’s the case. Evan Blass aka Evleaks and VentureBeat also mentioned that there was no talk of a microSD slot but they’ve pointed out that external storage has always been conspicuous with LG devices. So in other words, a no mention doesn’t mean it won’t be there. In another act to market themselves differently from the pack, the source also claims that LG will include some sort of modular expansion through a feature called “Magic Slot”. Again, there was no talk of how this would be implemented but there were examples given to show what it could include: camera add-ons, audio amplifier and physical keyboard. We saved the camera leak for last as LG’s cameras (of late) have been top notch. Based on an older leak, it’ll look something like this: Showing a dual-camera module, we’re forced to remember the pitfall of the Ultrapixel but we’ll hope in earnest that LG doesn’t screw this up. The main rear lens has been rumoured to be a 16-megapixel sensor and adding the secondary lens would allow wide-angle shots up to 135-degrees. The cameras will be separated by a module with four internal elements; two of them will be LED flash bulbs, one will be a laser autofocus and the last will be a similar RGB sensor. If all these specs have got you salivating – hold on – no word has got out of when it’ll be released. VentureBeat only managed to get a “first quarter of 2016” range of when it’ll be out.

Rory Lee,Mobile data in Malaysia is more affordable than you think,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/31/mobile-data-in-malaysia-is-more-affordable-than-you-think/,"internet data price,internet price,Malaysia,Malaysia Broadband Price,malaysia data price,malaysia internet price,malaysia mobile data price,mobile data,mobile data price,mobile data price malaysia","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-12-31,"If you’re frustrated with how expensive your data plan is, or if you feel cheated by some mobile operators who  claim to give you more Internet  but limits usage to certain times of the day, we understand your pain. If you’ve been envying our neighbours in Indonesia, who are paying nearly half of what we pay for 1GB of data, we feel you too. But, if you’re thinking of creating a blog to hate on our mobile carriers, citing examples of how much cheaper data is in our neighbouring countries, you might want to reconsider. This is because based on data collected by website  Tech In Asia , we actually have more affordable data — on average, per 1GB — than most countries in Southeast Asia. In their study, Tech In Asia compiled data from all the Southeast Asian countries and calculated what the typical price of 1GB (in USD) of data was. Then, they looked up the minimum wage of each country, (picking the typical wage of a low-income worker in Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia because they didn’t have an official minimum wage) comparing it with the respective data costs. Finally, they used that data to estimate how many hours a worker would have to work to be able to afford 1GB of data and arranged the countries according to scale in a nifty infographic. The results of their study are as follows: Full infographic at the end of this post From the data, Malaysia is actually doing quite well, finishing within the top 5 of all the countries in SEA for the most affordable data, despite the fact that we’re paying nearly USD1.60 (RM6.88) more than Indonesia and almost USD1 (RM4.30) higher than Vietnam and Myanmar for 1GB of data. Thanks to our higher minimum wage, a Malaysian minimum wage worker would only have to put in 3 hours and 45 minutes of hard work to enjoy 1GB of data. We’re still far off from Brunei though, who leads the pack at only 1 hour and 4 minutes of work needed for 1GB of data, despite their data costing USD2.67 (RM11.48) more than Malaysia. The power of a higher income nation eh? Another interesting bit of information is how incredibly low the price of mobile data in Cambodia is, coming in at a cool USD1.50/GB (RM6.45), sliding them into third place right behind Singapore despite their minimum wage being only USD0.66 (RM2.84) per hour. There is only one cause for concern: The accuracy of this data. Let’s take Malaysia for example. Based on the infographic, we average USD4.42 per 1GB of data, which is roughly equivalent to RM19/GB. Are our plans that expensive? Let’s take a look at the current prepaid data plans being offered by our Telcos: 
 XPAX HOTLINK FAST DIGI TUNETALK DATATATA U MOBILE UMI *these are currently promotion rates Across these 18 different plans, the average (mean) cost of 1GB of data in Malaysia is RM18.68, which is pretty close to the average in the data set. Keep in mind the lower average value is likely because of the promotions that are currently active. Hashtag legit information (as far as Malaysia is concerned anyway). It’s no secret that we’ve arrived at an era where everyone is obsessed with staying connected. In the past, only moderately large F&B chains offer free WiFi to their customers, but now even mamak shops have “FREE WIFI” signs pasted in and around their establishment. Why? Well, smartphones are getting more and more accessible for the masses and we all know that unless we keep our phones connected to the Internet, they’re little more than 180g bricks. But, we can’t always rely on WiFi to stay connected. What if we’re on the train? Or in a cab? I mean, we can’t just NOT send that tweet or NOT check if our new Instagram picture broke the 11-like barrier right? That would be  absurd . As the citizens flailed about in a chaotic mess, crying out for a saviour, our local telcos came riding in on white stallions offering data plans like food to the hungry. Those who could afford it rejoiced while others griped about how expensive it was compared to our neighbouring countries — some of which could be considered less developed than we are. The problem with that is when you argue “affordability” based purely on how much a plan costs, you’re leaving other crucial factors like income, development, penetration and even freedom of Internet, out of the equation. That’s like arguing who’s the best badminton player based purely on how fast their smashes are. It seems that the folks over at Tech In Asia have had enough of this nonsense and thanks to them, we now have a better understanding (hopefully) of what affordability really means. That said, this chart doesn’t appear to differentiate between connection speeds (4G LTE, 3G, 2G, etc) so that could be another factor affecting cost. Stability and coverage  could also be another reason for the difference in cost. We’d much rather pay a little more for a wider and more stable data connection. What do you think of this infographic? Should carriers focus more on reducing cost or improving coverage and stability? Let us know in the comments below. Thanks to  @cruzzmz  for the tip! [ SOURCE ]"

From OLED displays to a remake of the  iPhone 5c , we’re still left guessing as to what  Apple ’s new standout feature will be for the 2016.  This year was surely a busy innovating year for the tech manufacturer, as we saw the iPad Pro and the Pencil adding themselves to Apple’s inventory. But in terms of design it got weird, yes, we’re looking at you, Smart Battery Case. Weird or different, however you look at it, Apple might do it again.  Just in a way that’s more functional rather than aesthetically appealing. We say this due to new reports that cite Apple will make the  iPhone 7  waterproof and it won’t be made out of aluminium this time.  DigiTimes claims that using this new “material” (whatever it is) plus sealing all the ports, grills and buttons will allow them fully classify the iPhone 7 as waterproof.  Hopefully, they’ll find a workaround for the flap enclosure like Sony has, otherwise, it’ll be quite frustrating having a flap for everything. But having said, they might just drop some ports all together as other rumours have said Apple will merge the lightning cable with the 3.5mm headphone jack. Their report goes on to state that Apple will likely rework the antenna lines that run along the device but they don’t provide a how to the statement. Interestingly, this leak could be referring to the much talked about 6c, that will follow in the footsteps of the 5c but who knows. We’re a long way off from Fall 2016 so you can bet that more information will come about throughout the new year. They’ve done it before and they’ll probably do it again, Apple will probably “reinvent” something else. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

Using a mobile app, Uber lets you request for a clean and reliable ride, which is like a breath of fresh air in cities with failed taxi services.  The one billionth trip was taken in London on a Honda Insight Hybrid. To celebrate the occasion, the lucky rider is receiving a year’s worth of Uber rides, while the driver will be getting a well deserved holiday at a Uber city of his choice. Not bad for a short trip that only costs £5 (about RM32). To top it off, Uber is also making a charitable donation to an organisation at the neighbourhood where ride had started.  Despite its political and regulatory hurdles, Uber has been growing quite rapidly covering hundreds of cities in 68 countries worldwide. It is said that they are currently doing 3 million trips a day which is substantially more than its competitor, Lyft. While they are doing well in most markets, Uber is also facing bans and suspension by some local authority such as Spain and Germany.  Fortunately, it is still business as usual in Malaysia as it still operates in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru. Despite protests by taxi drivers, SPAD (Land Transport Authority) has yet to  implement new regulation  for these new “ride-sharing” services. For riders, it is a better alternative to taxis without the hassle of haggling. At the same time, driving with Uber is an opportunity to make extra income which is more critical with the rising cost of living.  At the current rate, Uber isn’t slowing down and eventually it could possibly render car ownership redundant. Of course, this is only possible if it is extensive and affordable enough to do so. Already it is cheaper than most taxis and in some markets, it could be  cheaper than taking a bus . Whatever regulation SPAD plans to enforce, we hope it would be beneficial to both consumers and the industry.  Would you consider taking Uber daily if it is cheaper than buying a car?

These projects are basically pet projects that their best and brightest decided to take up when given some project-specific time off. Samsung has released some small tidbits on what we’re to expect and so far they include:  These innovative projects have been running under Samsung’s Creative Lab, an avenue for employees to build ideas from the ground up.  First of the bunch is WELT – a smart (literal) belt that allows its users to keep tabs on their waistline by analysing daily habits and behaviours. This makes a lot of sense since everyone wears a belt. WELT’s smart innards are discreet and won’t resemble anything other than a regular looking… belt.  WELT takes note of your waist size, eating frequencies, track steps and even notes your sedentary moments. Finally, the belt will go through all your data by sending it to its designated app and provide you with useful health related tips and plans. Who knows, maybe the engineer in charge will even steer us away from fast food joints by making the belt tighten itself based on GPS and geographical tagging places like KFC. “rink” is the next project that lets you “take mobile VR to the next level”. The device itself is a hand-held motion controller that further explores the possibilities of virtual reality technology. Combine that with Samsung’s Gear VR and consumers might just enter these VR realms themselves. We saved the best for last; here’s TipTalk, an amazing device that lets you play secret agent by allowing communication through a special watch strap and your fingertips.

While it may be “smaller”, this little device’s spec sheet is going to surprise you. Subsequently, this may not even be the highest specification for the  One Plus 2 Mini , as the Shenzen-based company has always listed the last number to correspond to a higher specification. For example E1003 would be better than E1000, that’s if a E1003 were to exist. OnePlus X shown Weirdly, it shares the looks more of a  One Plus X , rather than the OnePlus 2, being more rounder around the edges and its backing receiving what looks like a glossy glass finish.

The screen itself will feature a Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) and it’ll have the infamous Snapdragon 810 SoC underneath its chassis.  Surprisingly, the 810 processor on the Mini (2GHz) won’t be under-clocked, as it was on the bigger One Plus 2 (1.8GHz); leaving us to believe that OnePlus has managed to solve thermal issues that were associated with the chipset in the past. OnePlus 2 shown The other key internals differ from its big brother but the OnePlus 2 Mini doesn’t fall far from its family tree.

Android  isn’t the most optimised operating system for tablets. OK, it’s quite useless actually since you can do practically everything on your Android smartphone anyway. So maybe  Windows 10 , despite how incomplete and frustrating it is, is the way to go.  Samsung  certainly thinks so since what looks like their latest 12-inch Windows 10 tablet was just certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG. Rumours that Samsung were working on a 12″ Windows 10 tablet have been floating around for quite some time now but this is the first piece of solid confirmation that this device is indeed in the pipeline. According to SamMobile Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG certifications are usually a good indicator that the device is on the way to the shelves soon. The 12-inch unit bearing the model number SM-W700 is said to feature a screen resolution of either 2560×1600 or 3840×2400. On the inside, the device will allegedly be powered by a 13nm Intel Core M processor paired with 4GB of RAM. Some have said that the tablet may also come with an S Pen which, coupled with the full Windows 10 experience, could certainly improve productivity. If Samsung adds a keyboard accessory then we may have another Surface/iPad Pro challenger on our hands. As Android phones continue to get bigger, the equivalent OS tablet is becoming less and less relevant because people can already do so much on their phone. Front facing speakers plus a 5.7″ Smartphone can provide just as much immersion (if not more) as a side/rear speakered 7.9-inch tablet. It’s just not worth carrying an extra device just so you have a slightly bigger screen. Keep in mind bigger, in this sense, doesn’t always mean better as in general smartphones have a better pixel density than tablets and a better pixel density usually equals a better viewing experience. Let me put it this way, spreading a single cup of waffle batter over a baking tray the size of your palm would get you a thicker, fluffier, and more satisfying waffle versus spreading the same amount over a tray the size of a dining table. The same concept applies to screens. If you spread 1080p over a 5.7″ display, you’re bound to get a better screen than if it was spread over 12-inches of real estate. So if media consumption is not the best, productivity has to be the tablet’s redeeming factor, and in that Windows 10 beats Android hands down. Considering how wonky Windows 10 is, that’s saying quite a lot about how unoptimised Android is for the big screen. The Korean electronics giant isn’t the only one launching a Windows 10 tablet though as Xiaomi has just  released its Mi Pad 2  in both Android and Windows 10. It has been a while since Samsung has launched a Windows-powered tablet but it seems that they’ve recognised that if you want a tablet, Android is no bueno. [ SOURCE ]"

What caught everyone’s eye was the dragon it had beating at the heart of the device; a  Snapdragon 820  to be specific. It was the first Windows Phone device to have been spotted with  Qualcomm ‘s latest baby in the driver’s seat. What’s more, the GFXBench entry also indicated that the device would feature a large 5.8″ 2560×1440 pixel panel with a 20-megapixel primary camera and a 12MP front-facing selfie camera. Mmm, yummy specs. There were some oddities, however, as memory was only listed at 1GB of RAM with a peculiar 43GB of internal storage. Then again, it isn’t uncommon for manufacturers to configure the device differently when running benchmarks. In any case, it looks like there could be a monstrous Windows Phone (likely running Windows 10 Mobile) set to be released sometime next year. In fact, a new report out of  Germany’s Dr Windows  claims that the device could see an official unveiling at the upcoming  Mobile World Congress  (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona next February. However, the report also notes that HP has yet to give the project the final go-ahead. With specs that exceed even Microsoft’s own Windows flagship devices (plus it could be cheaper), could this be the Windows Phone messiah fans have been waiting for? We doubt it. Especially if Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t receive the updates it needs in time. Though we haven’t spent time with the Lumia flagships, reports and reviews point to a worrying trend of incomplete (plus buggy) software, similar to that on the Surface line of 2-in-1 devices. Reviewers have noted some minor problems such as 4K video recording not working properly to big problems like the home screen disappearing entirely after an app crashes — something that happens quite often apparently — which shouldn’t happen in a completed product. If these problems lie with Windows 10 Mobile, then all the hardware in the world won’t be able to save the experience. It is admirable that it seems like HP wants to show Microsoft how to really build a Windows 10 Mobile flagship, but unless Redmond steps up its own game, the new device will likely not amount to anything. What a shame that would be. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

One of the sexiest words to come out of tech. The idea that you can swap out any old part on your smartphone for new one, but keep everything else exactly the same, is almost too alluring.  Too bad it keeps getting delayed. Well, thank goodness for crowd-funding because now we have the next best thing: Modular smartphone cases. 
 The thing that makes the idea of a modular device, be it a smartphone,  smartwatch , or, in this case, a smartcase, so brilliant is that it is completely customisable. For the first time the users themselves can decide exactly what they want or don’t want to have on their device. Fancy a good camera? Get a powerful camera module. Need more juice to last you an entire day? Get a battery module. Want a chainsaw to go jungle trekking? Get a…err well, I don’t think there’s a module for that yet but I’m sure you can see my point. Initially, people thought that a modular smartphone was the way to go, so companies like  Google  poured their resources into developing a modular smartphone, but it obviously that  had its own   host of problems too . Then, along came the people who founded nexpaq, a small group of talented individuals who wanted to bring the modular concept into the world on a much smaller scale:  a smartphone case . It’s something everyone uses, it’s something almost everyone needs and — perhaps most importantly — something far more accessible to the general public. Despite claiming to be cheaper than the smartphones we know and readily purchase today, purchasing a modular smartphone was always going to be a big investment. However, with a case like nexpaq’s, a  starter kit  that includes a case and four modules would only set you back USD169 (around RM728). The best part? The folks at nexpaq are enlisting the help of the community to develop their modular smartphone case, releasing developer kits for both the modules and its accompanying software. Now, more are following suit, with the latest one coming from a company called i-Blades who have put up their version of the modular smartphone case, the i-Blades Smartcase. The i-Blades Smartcase is currently on Indiegogo looking for funding and the best part about it is that their modules can apparently stack infinitely. Your device would look like it has one of Apple’s  Smart Battery  Cases though, but I digress. If you’re interested, head on over to their  project page  and check it out. I really do believe that modular devices are the future. I don’t want some guy I don’t know in a lab coat in some factory in the middle of China deciding what I should and shouldn’t have on my smartphone. I want that power. It’s my phone after all. That said, I don’t think we’re quite ready for the modular smartphone just yet, but a modular smartphone case? I wouldn’t mind me some of that. Baby steps, right? [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ]"
Alexander Wong,Is this Xiaomi’s new budget smartphone?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/29/xiaomi-redmi-3-smartphone-certification/,"Android,Redmi 3,smartphone,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Redmi 3","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-12-29,"The  Redmi 2  is probably the best entry-level device for those with a tight budget. It offers a decent 4.7″ HD 720p screen, dual-SIM slots and 4G LTE for under RM400. While the specs are impressive, the build quality is still quite plasticky, which is understandable for its low price tag.  Following the release of its metal-clad  Redmi Note 3 , Xiaomi appears to be taking the same premium route for its upcoming budget device. The phone you’re seeing here has just appeared on China’s TENNA certification and it is believed to be the new Redmi 3. It gets an all metal back like its larger Redmi Note 3 but without a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Being a unibody design, the back cover doesn’t seem to be removable, which means you can’t replace the battery on your own. According to its purported spec-sheet, there will be a microSD expansion, which is likely to be housed on the SIM tray slot.  The Redmi 3 is said to be having a slightly larger 5″ HD 720p display and it is expected to run on a higher 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board storage is listed at 16GB and it also comes with a standard 13MP + 5MP camera combination. This is quite a huge step up, pushing the Redmi into the mid-range category, even if this was an “enhanced version”.  With better specs and premium materials, we are curious if Xiaomi could maintain its affordable 699CNY (RM463) price tag as the Redmi 2. It is likely to priced higher but it shouldn’t exceed its bigger Redmi Note 3 that starts from 899 CNY (about RM595).  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Arif Lee,The four-way 4K video battle,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/29/nexus-6p-4k-camera-comparison-galaxy-note5-xperia-z5-iphone-6s-plus/,,,2015-12-29,"You asked for a video comparison and here you have it. We put these four heavyweights in the camera department to the 4K video recording test. And while we understand that most people out there won’t have the technology to view 4K content, we decided that choosing the highest recording resolution for all four devices would be the fairest gauge.   Duking it out will be: A slow but steady advancement of camera technology has us finding that most flagship smartphones are now capable of being the only device we’d use to take images and video, rendering point and shoots somewhat obsolete. Easily put – the best camera you’ll have is the one in your pocket. How you use that technology will be dictated by the photography skills you’ve honed throughout your “journey”, if there’s one to begin with. That said, a professional photographer could definitely take better photos than someone that has little/no knowledge on the matter. Of course, when using a smartphone, you don’t necessarily have to be knowledgeable in photography to begin with but have you seen those campaigns dedicated to showing off what these smartphone cameras are capable of? Apple has been running a  campaign  to show-off what the iPhones can do. Other smartphone makers didn’t bother following suit but you can check out their imaging and video capabilities through a quick search. When 4K video recording hit the scene back in 2013, we thought capturing content at that resolution was crazy; more so, when you’re viewing it on screens that hover around 5-inches. But we’re not here to argue about whether Full HD or Quad HD screens are sufficient when it comes to actually viewing the content on them. We’re here to see how 4 smartphones perform when tasked to handle the rough and bumpy Malaysian roads that often surprise you with a new pothole or two with every passing day – obviously, OIS would be important here. The following are a breakdown of the 4 respective specs: All four devices had some form of image/video stabilisation; the Nexus 6P uses software based technology, shared also by the Sony Xperia Z5 Dual which uses its own software-based two-stage SteadyShot stabilisation. On the other hand, Apple is the only one that uses solely hardware based stabilisation. Particularly special out of the bunch, the Galaxy Note5 uses both hardware and software video stabilisation but this combination is only available when shooting up to Full HD (1080p) at 30fps. We thought it was clear which came out on top but feel free to share your opinions."

Piles upon piles of perfectly good food were thrown it out because they were slightly old, or looked a little less than perfect. The sad thing is that this is the same for most things, including smartphones. If you’re a smartphone buyer, odds are you have bought more than one device. The only problem is, what do you do with your old phone when your new one arrives? Do you toss it out? Give it to a niece/nephew/child (let’s be real they probably have better phones than your old  iPhone  anyway)? Try to sell it to on a certain popular local forum filled with lowballers? Well,  Vmall  now has a new option for you. Vmall Malaysia is currently conducting a BETA test for their “Trade-in & Go Green With Honor!” programme, in collaboration with LTG Technologies, where — yep you guessed it — you can trade in your old devices and be compensated for it. You won’t be getting money, though. Instead, you’ll be getting a Vmall code which you can then use to redeem a Vmall voucher which you can use to purchase any device on the website. To put it in simpler terms: At this moment, the number of devices per manufacturer, with the exception being  Apple  and  Samsung , is rather limited. Hopefully, they will add support for more devices further down the line. If your trade-in value is RM40 or higher, LTG will arrange for a pickup at your specified address free of charge. Once LTG receives your products, they will evaluate and see if your devices are worth the quoted amount. If they sign off on it, you will receive a Vmall voucher code of equal value to that of your devices. If they don’t, they will inform you of the new value of your device, allowing you to decide whether or not you want to take the offer. If you don’t respond within 3 days, they will automatically assume you accept the revised offer. The best thing about this programme is that you can register any amount of smartphones, from old and functioning to broken phones (yes they accept broken phones if it is within their criteria). However, remember to register all your devices at one go so that you receive a single code for a single voucher. Not only will this help you hit that RM40 free delivery sweet spot, it will also help when you make purchases on Vmall, because you can only use one voucher per purchase. Keep in mind that this programme is only in BETA but it is expected to go live sometime early next year. If you’ve had your eye on an honor or Huawei device, this seems like a pretty decent incentive to go and get one. [ SOURCE ]"

This suggestion is thanks to the same leaker who previously got the S6 edge+ diagram spot-on a year before its release. Based on the new diagrams, it seems that Samsung will keep to old habits and maintain a 5.2-inch screen on the Galaxy S7, while the curved Galaxy S7 edge variant will get a larger 5.5-inch display. Then on, things are pretty much the same, as information has shown that the rear of both Galaxy S7 should look very similar. Pointing towards the backings of these smartphones to feature the same metal and glass composition – a real sore of a fingerprint magnet. Taking a thorough look at the diagram, Android Authority spotted that Samsung looks to have omitted the IR blaster this time around, continuing what they’ve done on their larger devices: Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. At the same time, a Korean tech site has released a different diagram, that reaffirms the two different sizings for the flat Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Based on earlier rumours and leaks, many have concluded that these bigger screens will also see Samsung implement pressure sensitive technology for the first time, if their patent filings were to materialise so quickly.  Otherwise, there has been whispers of a microSD slot making a  return ; a feature that would be welcomed openly by those who strayed away from Samsung devices after dropping external storage all-together. Camera-wise, the new  BRITECELL  sensors that were revealed back in November should make an appearance as well. Touted to enhance low light performance by increasing sensitivity and reduce size too by 17% – leading us to assume the Galaxy S7 series will have a reduced camera bump. It’s more than likely that Samsung will announce these devices during MWC 2016 in Barcelona, that’s scheduled to begin on the 22nd of February, so be sure to expect more leaks as the date nears.

Can you confidently tell how far apart one building is from the next and navigate it without a proper scale? What about those little parts that are obscured by a building or a shadow? Can you tell what’s hidden there? Now imagine all of that detail compressed into the body of a baby girl and you’ve only begun to scrape the surface of how difficult surgeon Dr Redmond Burke’s operation was. Teegan Lexcen, a 4-month-old baby was admitted into the Niklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, Florida because she was born with a misplaced heart. Without surgery, she would be dead by Christmas. The worst part? Doctors couldn’t see a way in to operate. I don’t think I need to tell you how delicate heart surgery is, or how difficult it can be. It becomes nigh impossible when you don’t have all the information you need. Burke says that surgeons need to be able to visualise the entire procedure before they step into the operating room, which is why many surgical teams passed on Teegan’s operation because they kept running into walls during this process: It seemed inoperable. Burke had the same problem as he had no way of knowing if a standard incision over the sternum would be enough, but “inoperable” was not a word he enjoyed using. Exhausting medical solutions, the team began looking for creative solutions and one particularly enterprising member uploaded the scans of Teegan’s chest to  Sketchfab , converting them into 3D stereoscopic imagines, which allowed them to view it in VR. Virtual Reality. That was the answer. Burke said that with  Google Cardboard  and a smartphone he was able to see the patient’s entire heart by simply tilting his head. He could turn it and manipulate it as if he was already in the operating room. From there, Burke could see Teegan’s heart as well as her chest wall and with that information, he knew that a standard incision would indeed be fine. According to Burke, this solution came just in the nick of time; any longer and her kidneys may have suffered too much from her being put under. She would be alive, but on dialysis for the rest of her days. We’re floored that a little bit of cardboard and a smartphone actually saved someone’s life. That and good old fashioned human ingenuity of course. Burke views every operation as possible and it was down to whether the doctor had the confidence to perform it or not. With VR he could visualise the steps in his head and help him come up with a plan of operation for his team which allowed him to save his patient. Seven hours later, little Teegan was all patched up and ready for Christmas and ho, ho, ho-pefully for many more Christmases to come. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

Through our experience with this smartwatch, it definitely doesn’t come close to the manufacturer’s quoted two-three day battery life; mostly lasting us a day and a half at most.  If you’re like us and are unhappy about the battery life on your new Samsung smartwatch, this new software update might just give you a little extra time – see what we did there. Arriving in the form of a software update, version R730TUVU1AOL3 is small, like 4.85MB small. Yet, this roll-out (that we haven’t received) supposedly brings battery life optimisation onto the Gear S2. The what’s new section doesn’t give much away, merely stating “Battery life has been optimised” but does this mean that it wasn’t before? Err… That aside, the update also includes: As far as smartwatches go, getting the software update will require you to use your smartphone. Here’s how to see if you can update to the latest version: Meanwhile, we’d appreciate if Samsung further refined the low-battery warning prompt, which we felt was too passive and lead us to always finding a “dead” smartwatch on our wrist. Although, we’re aware that some people would be happy with an expensive “bracelet” on their wrist. Time has taken us a long way, literally and through advancements of technology, we  have our smartwatches today. There hasn’t been much traction for their adoption with battery life still not lasting long enough for most to accept. Samsung isn’t alone, as Android Wear and Apple equivalents also suffer the same fate. We can only hope battery technology catches up to what their lithium bodies power up in the near future.

Alexander Wong,This might be the best alternative to KLIA Express,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/30/here-is-a-cheaper-way-to-go-to-klia/,"Car Sharing,Comos,electric car,KLIA,KLIA Express,KLIA Express Alternative,Renault Zoe,Ride Sharing,Uber,Uber Malaysia","Cool stuff,Others",2015-12-30,"If you’re a frequent traveler,  KLIA Express (ERL)  is the best way to get to Kuala Lumpur International Airport in under 30 minutes. With everything going up, the fares will be  increased  to RM55/way effective 1st January 2016. That’s a hefty RM110 for two people heading to the airport.  Is there a cheaper alternative? What if we tell you there’s another way of getting there with zero emission and it costs less than an  Uber  ride? COMOS, a ride-sharing provider that uses 100% electric vehicles has introduced an Airport Valet Service. For a flat rate of RM70, you can head to KLIA or KLIA2 in an electric-powered  Renault Zoe . The service comes with a designated COMOS staff, so you can hop-on and hop-off without worrying about parking. Do note that the Renault Zoe is a compact hatchback, so the boot isn’t as spacious as a typical sedan car.  The COMOS Airport Valet service would cost you RM70 which is inclusive of GST, toll and delivery charges to your location. So that equates to RM35/person for a trip for two or RM23.34/person for 3 pax. On the downside, it is only available from 9:00AM to 4:00PM, and it covers just the following areas in the Klang Valley.  If you haven’t tried COMOS before, the first step of getting a key card would take a while. You would need to  register  for a membership which now costs RM50 for 1 year (Normal: RM300). Once that’s done, you can collect your COMOS card and start booking as follows: You are advised to request the service at least 2 hours ahead of the intended time and it is subject to actual availability of cars. You may book for the next day but the option is only available after 10:00PM. This is a cashless service and the final amount will be charged to your registered credit card. You can read up more about the service  here . COMOS was introduced as an alternative means to car ownership. Being a ride-sharing service, you only pay for membership and usage fees according to your usage. At the moment, the rental costs RM6 for 15 minutes with a minimum booking of 30 minutes (RM12). For an all day usage, it will cost you a flat rate of RM144.  With its fleet of electric cars, there’s no fuel cost involved so you won’t need to return the car with a full tank. There are several COMOS pick up stations located around PJ and KL with more being planned out in the near future. Currently all bookings are done via its website on  comos.com.my  and soon they will be releasing a mobile app for iOS and Android. We’ve tried COMOS a couple of times and it is quite an experience driving a quiet vehicle that hums like a spaceship. Since it’s new, the number of stations with charging points are quite limited. It isn’t really that cost efficient for simple point to point trips since you’re required to return the vehicle to its limited pickup/drop off points.  If you’re making a stop, you would still need to pay for parking, which defeats the purpose of saving time and money. This would probably make more sense once they have more stations around strategic points including shopping malls and office complexes.  If COMOS isn’t viable due to timing and location, Uber is  currently offering  a flat rate of RM75 (excluding tolls) to KLIA/KLIA2. There’s no promo code required, and you can request anytime from now until 5th January 2016. Uber is available on  Android ,  iOS  and  Windows Phone . If you’re traveling alone, KLIA Express is still the cheaper option overall. Despite the RM55/way announcement, there are additional discounts if you book return tickets and purchasing them online or using specific credit cards. At the moment,  Mastercard holders  are entitled to a 20% discount. A return KLIA Express ticket cost RM100 and it will cost you just RM80 which is equivalent to RM40 per way. That’s basically RM5 more than usual RM35/way price.  [  SOURCE  ]"

Or rather, Rose Gold. It used to be gold, but who has time for that anymore. What you want is a slight blush on your gold, which I guess makes it a little shyer than just full on gold y’know? It became the easiest way to tell the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s apart, and now almost every smartphone manufacturer’s flagship device comes in this strawberry milkshake colour. The latest one to join the fray is  Huawei , with their confusing  Mate S . Why is it confusing? Well, for starters, it costs roughly the same as the  Samsung Galaxy Note5  but it doesn’t have  nearly as many features or boast nearly the same specifications . What’s more, it comes with Huawei’s EMUI which is slowly starting to  look like every other Chinese smartphone manufacturer’s Android Skin . A perplexing smartphone at this price point then, when they clearly could have made it a much more well-rounded device. Well, Huawei is trying to sweeten the deal with their Malaysian launch of the Rose Gold variant of the Mate S. It is now on sale in all authorised Huawei authorised retailers and the price will remain the same at RM2,698. It will sport the same internal specifications and camera, but now that it comes in pink – uh Rose Gold – it suddenly should appeal to the “special woman in your life”. I’m personally more concerned with the performance and build of a device, but what do I know about what women want. I will say that it is kind of refreshing to at least get a second colour option because let’s face it, the Mate S’s Gold always seemed a little too tacky."
Rory Lee,What if your car could see?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/23/what-if-your-car-could-see/,"autonomous cars,SegNet,self-driving cars",Cool stuff,2015-12-23,"Autonomous cars are the next big thing. Well, it’s actually the current-to-next big thing, but we digress. The point is that people are apparently bored of driving cars and want systems and programs to drive them around everywhere so that they can sit in the back seat and pretend to be Donald Trump. The only problem with self-driving cars is that they aren’t able to function properly in the real world as you simply can’t replace human instinct and reaction when things on the road get challenging. Why? Because cars can’t see in real time the way we do, so it makes it very difficult to make split second decisions when that double parked car pulls out suddenly. Apparently, now they can. 
 Thanks to SegNet, a new system created by the University of Cambridge, your dreams of being driven around by software might just come into fruition. SegNet can “read” the road in front if it, allowing it to differentiate various elements like the sky, other cars, road markings and even people. SegNet “sees” the road in an RGB image and then classifies different layers and objects using a  Bayesian analysis  of the scene. According to the release, the system can “take an image of a street scene it hasn’t seen before and classify it, sorting objects into 12 different categories in real time”. It can also apparently deal with light, shadow and night environments and currently labels more than 90% of pixels correctly. Unlike laser/radar-guided systems that require expensive base sensors which cost more than the car itself, SegNet has been “trained” by a group of Cambridge undergraduates who manually labelled every pixel in over 5,000 images. Once that was complete, the researchers proceeded to train the system for over 2 days, after which one of the students notes that it is surprisingly good at recognising things in an image. From our testing, we tend to agree. It does a remarkable job at differentiating between the 12 elements though there is quite a lot of polishing to do, especially at night. As this system is “trained” though, it can only get better over time as it sees more images and learns to recognise more elements. One of the biggest problems about driving around in Malaysia is that the lines are never where they should be. Add that to the fact that people double park like there is no tomorrow and that the roads have potholes the size of Canada, even human beings would have trouble navigating our treacherous streets, what more a software? With this though, there is the potential to train the system to recognise these little nuances that make up our little snowflake of a country. Given the right circumstances, the possibilities are quite endless. Although the researchers say that this is still far from being able to be implemented into autonomous cars, we could possibly see this in a domestic robot – like a robot vacuum cleaner – in the short term. From where we stand, trust in an autonomous car seems to be the biggest hurdle for people to overcome. Would you relinquish control of your car in a highway to a computer program developed by some bloke in a laboratory? If you want to test out this system for yourself, head on over to  their website  and you can upload a picture of your own to be scanned by SegNet, or you can browse through the sample images they’ve uploaded.

But that means they hardly ever last a day, much less two days. Carrying a power bank or a charger has become a norm in our society. Acer has good news for those who want raw, unadulterated battery power, because their  Liquid Z630  smartphone comes with an enormous 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. With a battery this size it becomes very unlikely that you will need to carry a powerbank around, much less another battery. In fact, that massive battery supports USB OTG (on-the-go) charging so you can even help a friend out by giving them a quick top-up if their device is running low on battery. Mighty handy in a pinch and for RM659, this is one of the most affordable and good valued devices with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports OTG charging in Malaysia. This is because the device itself does boast pretty decent specs, with a quad-core MediaTek processor clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. This should ensure that everyday tasks and light to moderate application multitasking will go on without a hitch. It also has a 5.5-inch HD IPS panel and an 8-megapixel front and rear camera combo. 8-megapixels is quite a lot for a front facing camera, especially in this device’s price bracket. Even some flagship devices only rock a 5MP sensor. More megapixels mean that your selfies will be much more detailed and less pixelated. If you don’t fancy such a big device, or you simply feel that you don’t need all that battery power, Acer does offer a smaller device with a 5” HD IPS display, the Acer  Liquid Z530 . The name suggests that this smartphone would be a downgrade from the the Liquid Z630, but it also shares its bigger brother’s internal hardware as well as camera optics. That’s a pretty good deal for RM559. Acer also has an entry level device in the Liquid Z line, the Liquid  Z330 , priced at RM439. It comes bundled with a 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM running underneath its 4.5” screen. That should be more than enough for you to get a feel of what the Android experience is all about, making this device the perfect starter smartphone for anyone. All three devices will have blazingly fast dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Additionally, these devices will have the Acer Float Apps which essentially allows users to open more than one application and multitask at the same time. Acer also bundles a Float Caller which appears as a mini popup when a call comes in, letting the user decide how to respond without interrupting what they’re doing. Every one of the trio will also have what Acer calls the Quick Mode. The Quick Mode functions to allow users to pick between three customised layout options: Standard Mode (for those familiar with smartphones), Easy Mode (for those just starting out), and Basic Mode (locks down application and usage for kids). There is also a Kids Center application which grants parental control over the device for a safer browsing, viewing and playing environment for your child. These devices also come with Acer’s Bluelightshield which reduces strain on the eyes by reducing the amount of blue light emissions from the display.

Rory Lee,"HTC’s One X9 is definitely no flagship, but maybe that’s not such a bad thing",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/28/htcs-one-x9-is-definitely-no-flagship-but-maybe-thats-not-such-a-bad-thing/,"Android,Android Marshmallow,HTC,HTC One,HTC One X9,HTC One X9 launch,HTC One X9 launch china,One X9 launch,One X9 launch china,smart phone,smartphone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-28,"MORE HORSEPOWER. That’s usually a buyer’s biggest criteria when looking for a smartphone. It’s also what people look for when determining the value-for-money aspect of a device, as consumers will try their best to squeeze every bit of horsepower for as low of a price as possible. It is these buyers that were ultimately disappointed when  HTC  launched the  One A9  because it had decidedly mediocre specs for a not-low-at-all asking price of USD400. In a world where smartphone manufacturers are churning out devices with incredible specs for an equally incredible low price, this is simply unacceptable. Thankfully, HTC’s new “hero” device seems to rectify this problem, to some extent at least. Rumours have been floating around for awhile now about HTC’s new  One X9 . Early leaks suggested that it could run the  latest top-of-the-line processor from Qualcomm or MediaTek , which reignited the fire within the hearts of many an HTC fan. However, as time progressed, the rumours changed and on paper it looked like the One X9  was going to be another disappointment . Well, the device has finally come out from the shadows and at first glance, it definitely doesn’t look like the flagship device everyone was clamouring for. Then again, since this was launched this year, were we realistically expecting it to outperform the  One M9  especially since it doesn’t even bear the M badge? The One X9 sports a 5.5″ 1080p panel (though there doesn’t seem to be any information on whether it will be an AMOLED or IPS screen) which results in a pixel density of 401 ppi that HTC claims has a 170-degree viewing angle. On the inside, the device is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 processor and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal storage. Thankfully, HTC has included a microSD slot that allows expansion up to 2TB. It will also feature a reasonably large 3,000 mAh battery and support for dual-SIM. Optics-wise, the device sports a 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear camera with optical image stabilisation and 4K video recording, plus a 5MP f/2.8 front-facing shooter. It is likely that the device will come pre-loaded with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, much like the HTC One A9. Although the specs are nothing to shout about, the device does bring back HTC’s much-loved BoomSound front-facing stereo speakers, something that is missing from it’s smaller brother, the One A9. HTC also went further down “nostalgia alley”, bringing back their backlit capacitive keys, which is placed where the HTC logo usually goes. One aspect that will be missed is the absence of a fingerprint sensor, something that is available on the HTC One A9. Another serving of good news is that the metallic smartphone looks to retail at a lower price than the One A9, coming in at 2,399 Yuan, which translates to around RM1,598. Yes, if you did pick up on it, the retail price is in CNY which means that this device — as of now — has only been launched in China with no information about availability elsewhere. This device, it seems, represents HTC’s stab at trying to get a bigger cut of the affordable premium smartphone market by competing with other Chinese manufacturers on their home soil. If you think horsepower is the be all and end all of smartphones, then this HTC One X9 will look like another disappointing HTC “hero” device that could have been so much more. It isn’t the best value-for-money device out there, but is a device’s worth measured only by how well it does on benchmarks? Sure, 4GB of RAM looks good on paper, but can you realistically feel the difference between 4GB and 3GB of RAM? Fit and finish has always been one of HTC’s strongest selling points. That and their front-facing speakers, both of which can be found on One X9. It honestly doesn’t look too bad either — except for that slightly sketchy camera visor — and based on the company’s track record, they certainly know how to do metal unibodies. The device’s closest competitor would probably be the Sony Xperia M5 Dual, and based on build alone, we definitely prefer a metal finish to the Xperia M5 Dual’s fingerprint-magnet glass-plastic construction. With proper optimisation, these specs should get you through day-to-day usage without a hitch and for a frankly reasonable price tag, this doesn’t seem like that bad a deal for HTC fans. Yeah, sure, you won’t be able to brag about it to your friends but then again, there aren’t that many brag-worthy HTC devices to begin with. With HTC’s flagships only managing to stay afloat as well as the Titanic could, perhaps the midrange premium market is where they can reclaim some of their former glory. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

Arif Lee,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review: Best of the breed,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/24/microsoft-surface-pro-4-review-best-of-the-breed/,,,2015-12-24,"When you step in the shoes that were once filled by Bill Gates, you better hope that you fulfill your role. Steve Ballmer unfortunately took upon the intimidating task and his reign lasted a good 13 years. A robust character, Ballmer excelled in his early days but by 2012 stock prices were idling too long and that ensued criticism of dropping everything that he had managed to achieve. Many have speculated that the failure of  Surface RT  tablet was the last straw for Microsoft’s overseeing board of directors, with a US$ 900 million write off being a mistake that couldn’t go unnoticed. Two years after Ballmer’s retirement, Satya Nadella has filled some big shoes and it has been an upward journey so far. Akin to Ballmer, the Surface Pro 4 sits in a precarious position as it has never been easy living up to your past successes. Microsoft said during their product launch that the  Surface Pro 4  is measurable to the MacBook Air but we haven’t seen a refresh on that since March 2015. And that wasn’t a huge facelift to begin with, so 2016 could really shape up to be a big year for laptops and convertibles; Apple says they won’t bother making anything in-between the MacBook Air and iPad Pro but they may rework their formula – ala a Pencil instead of a stylus. Competition outside of Apple has everyone trying to “emulate” the Surface(s) and what they can do. The first name that comes to mind is the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700, closely followed by HP’s Spectre x2. These two try to do what the Surface Pro 4 does but they don’t match up in terms of specs. This time around, more power equates to being more expensive. People might stay away hearing that, though we hope you’ll give this a read first before making any preconceived notions just based on the price."
Alexander Wong,Get extra prepaid bonuses if you reload before 2016,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/28/get-extra-prepaid-bonuses-if-you-reload-before-2016/,"DiGi,DiGi Prepaid,gst,GST Prepaid,prepaid,Prepaid Reload,Prepaid Top Up,Tune Talk,TuneTalk,Xpax,Xpax Prepaid","Celcom,DiGi,Players on the Field,TuneTalk",2015-12-28,"As 2015 comes to an end, Malaysian prepaid users will experience a change come 1st January 2016. Effective next year, all prepaid reloads  will no longer include  the 6% GST, so a RM10 top up will be sold at RM10. Should you hold out on your new reloads until the new year?  As the transition is taking place with new reload cards entering the shelves, a couple of telcos are dishing out special offers that will give you more than your money’s worth. Read on to find out what offers are available. For Digi, they are giving an extra 8% bonus on top of your actual airtime. So if you purchased a RM10 topup at RM10.60, you’ll be getting 80 sen bonus extra. The bonus airtime will be will be given to you within 72 hours and this is only applicable until 31st December 2015.  According to the  FAQ , this is only applicable to the current reload cards that carry the prefix “10”. The newer reloads that are sold without GST (RM10 RRP=RM10 Airtime) or carries the prefix “11” will not be entitled to the 8% bonus. The free airtime will be valid only for 5 days.  For Xpax Prepaid by Celcom, they are doing something similar but they are giving only 6% extra. This is basically matching the same value ringgit to ringgit based the retail price. So a RM10.60 top up will grant you an extra RM0.60 airtime, giving a total value of RM10.60. Strangely, the  Xpax offer  is only valid until 30th December 2015. Like Digi, the extra airtime will be granted within 72 hours, but take note that this is only applicable for domestic use only (not for roaming).  TuneTalk probably has the most generous offer of all. With a RM100 top up, they are  giving RM20 extra airtime  plus 3GB of mobile data. To redeem this, you would need to perform a single RM100 reload using the official  TuneTalk app  that’s available for both Android and iOS. The 3GB data will last for 30 days and any excess usage will be charged at 5 sen/MB if there are no other internet plans active. The promo is valid until 31st of December 2015, so you better hurry."
Alexander Wong,Here’s all you need to know about Prepaid and GST for 2016,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/28/malaysia-prepaid-gst-reload-refunds-2016/,"budget 2016,DiGi,DiGi Prepaid,gst,GST Prepaid,GST Rebate,GST Reload,Hotlink prepaid,Malaysia GST,prepaid,Prepaid GST Refund,Prepaid Reload,Prepaid Reload GST,Prepaid Top Up,Top Up GST,Tune Talk,TuneTalk,Xpax,Xpax Prepaid","Celcom,DiGi,Hotlink,Industry in General,Players on the Field,TuneTalk,U Mobile,XOX",2015-12-28,"Beginning 1st January 2016, all prepaid reloads in Malaysia will be sold without the extra 6% charge. This is in line with the directive to  exempt prepaid reloads  from GST. It doesn’t mean that prepaid is free from GST, as it will be charged upon usage, instead of being paid upfront.  Fortunately, the government will be offering GST rebates as announced during  Budget 2016 . To address concerns, MCMC has published the full details ahead of its implementation on new year’s day  Beginning 1st January, a RM10 prepaid reload will be sold at RM10, while a RM30 prepaid reload is sold at RM30 just like the old days. So you’re getting a full ringgit to ringgit value without the extra 6% charge. The official FAQ also states that old top up tickets must be sold at the original price without the extra 6% charge. At the moment, several prepaid brands are  offering extra bonus  and rewards if you top up by 31st December. However with the new mechanism, the GST charge will kick in when you reload. So after activation of a RM10 top up, you’ll get RM9.43 airtime with RM0.57 (6%) being deducted for GST. To the regular consumer, it appears to have no difference since eventually you’re getting 6% less versus paying 6% more. This will be running from 1st January until 31st December 2016 and there’s no mention if it will be extended to the following year.  The good news, of course, there’s a full GST rebate on prepaid usage. This will be applicable only to Malaysian citizens based on the NRIC or police/army identification number during registration. According to MCMC, the 6% GST will be refunded within 24 hours. So if you’ve topped up RM10, you should be getting the earlier deducted RM0.57 back to your prepaid account. In a nutshell, Malaysians should be able to enjoy the full reload amount but provided that you’re registered. You are advised to check with your telco provider to ensure they have your correct details.  The GST rebate is only for prepaid users, so Malaysian postpaid users will still continue to incur the 6% charge in their monthly bills. All domestic use including phone calls, SMS, mobile services and data are GST chargeable. International roaming including data usage overseas are zero rated and non-Malaysian prepaid users are also eligible for a refund.  For more information, you can read up the full FAQ  here .

As reported earlier, Telekom Malaysia  in collaboration  with iflix is offering free 12 months subscription worth RM96. The complimentary iflix service was supposed to roll out by mid-December but it took them awhile to sort out some technical issues. Well, it is worth the wait as the free streaming service requires no registration or sign in, allowing anyone in the household to streaming instantly. The iflix service will allow access for up to five devices per account and it supports up to two devices to stream concurrently. After your device is “registered”, you are still able to watch it on your mobile device on 4G or on other available WiFi connection. Want to watch iflix on the big screen? You can get yourself a  Google Chromecast  that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port.  There’s also offline viewing for those on  Android  and  iOS  devices, making this perfect for in-flight entertainment. However, it’s limited to 10 titles, movies or TV shows in any combination and it’ll live on your tablet/smartphone for seven days. Currently, this special “promo” only applies for UniFi household customers but TM has been quoted to roll-out the same perks for Streamyx customers on 4Mbps and 8Mbps lines at a later date. Those on UniFi BIZ plans, sorry, you’re out of luck. From what we gather, the free service is rolling out in stages, though most of us have managed to gain access in on our laptop and mobile phones. If you’re still unable to access iflix on your UniFi network, it might take awhile. In the scenario that you’re still prompted to login, an alternative method would be removing the iflix app and reinstalling it again on your mobile device. It is a little patchy as we still couldn’t get iflix to work on our Mi Pad and an iPhone 6. Good luck with all your binge watching, make sure it doesn’t affect your productivity."

A few months ago, we’ve  reviewed  the  Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition  and it offers an immersive experience when paired with a Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Retailing at RM799 back then, it is quite an expensive toy if compared to a Google Cardboard. However you do get a proper hands-free usage and it even comes with hardware control buttons at the sides.  Now Samsung Malaysia has brought in a new one that supports more models and most importantly, a lower price tag.  Dubbed simply as the  Gear VR , the new version is more affordable at RM459 (inclusive of GST). With its new flagship phablets around, the new Gear VR now supports 4 models – Galaxy Note5, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. Compared to the Innovator Edition that we’ve tried with the S6, the new version uses a softer upper strap without the hard piece, that secures the headset across your head. You do however still get a touchpad on the right which is slightly improved for better feel at the fingertips. The optical components remain unchanged with a 96 degree field of view and a 54-70 IPD coverage.  The Gear VR also gets additional controls which include a volume rocker, back button and a manual dial at the top for minor focus adjustments. As it is powered by Oculus, you’ll gain access to a library of apps and games that are designed for an immersive experience. If you are interested, you can find the Gear VR at Samsung Stores.

Rory Lee,Time to add some toppings to your vanilla Android experience,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/21/how-to-improve-nexus-6p/,,,2015-12-21,"Earlier, we covered why  vanilla Android wasn’t the flavour for you , much to the chagrin of fanatical  Android  purists who didn’t hesitate to declare their undying devotion to the stock Android experience, mocking us in the process. While that was – for the most part – amusing, we were glad to see that there were even more who were able to form logical arguments and valid points towards the strengths and weaknesses of the stock OS. Kudos to you! What most people do not realise is that there are users (in fact a considerable majority) who use their devices in the configuration it came out of the box, fearing to dig deeper into their device’s settings in the event something disastrous happens. While one could make the argument that previous Nexus devices were geared more towards those with experience rather than the mass market, we feel that the  Nexus 6P  is the first truly “mainstream” Nexus device that we would have no problem recommending to anyone. It’s got great software, a great camera, a great screen, and a premium build with a premium price to boot. Naturally, more and more people who are not so entrenched, some inexperienced, in the ways of the Android (sorry coming off a Star Wars high here) would be enticed to purchase this device. If you are one of those people and the entire universe of Android customisation seems a little too overwhelming, fret not, we’ve got you covered. Here are a few bite-sized pieces of beginner-friendly customisability that should improve the usability of your Nexus device."

Not only were these devices supposed to give the best  Android  experience of any smartphone, they also shored up what was traditionally every Nexus device’s weakness: the camera. Even more excited than others were the fans of  Google ‘s old  Nexus 5  because they finally had an upgrade to their beloved 4.95-inch phone. Well, that was until it melted in one of their pockets. User AFChimpanse took to the  /r/Android  forums yesterday and shared a story about how his/her brand new Nexus 5X had a meltdown, literally. According to the OP (original poster), the device was sitting in his/her pocket when suddenly it started heating up. When the OP took it out, it continued to heat up and started producing a “low frizzling sound” releasing an “extremely toxic smell”. The smartphone eventually got too hot to hold in the hand and the OP had to put it down. When (we’re assuming the frizzling had died down) the device was picked up again, the user noticed that a portion of the back cover to the right of the LG logo had melted inwards. User DarcyFitz and GlassHalfFull pointed out that it should be a battery issue judging from the location of the melted bit relative to the device’s internals identified by iFixit’s teardown photo: According to AFChimpanse, the device was only 11 days old and had never been plugged into a third-party charger before. So I guess we can rule out  faulty cables  as a cause. While there is nothing official to validate the user’s claims, this isn’t the first time a smartphone has exploded, as there have been cases where  this OnePlus One  and this  Samsung Galaxy S3  (though this was  because of a counterfeit battery ) suffered a similar fate. Most smartphone batteries are filled with chemicals that could potentially be triggered if it endures excessive force or physical trauma, as can be seen in this video by TechRax below: Although you might not be taking a hammer to your device, there is a chance that these devices may come in contact some unfavourable conditions which may cause undesired reactions. Unfortunately, when it comes to phones you stop drop and roll so if your phone is getting a little hotter than usual, our suggestion would be to take it out of your pocket immediately. We don’t think this is the type of explosion you’d want in your pants. As you know, the Nexus 5X isn’t officially available in Malaysia, but you can  get it through DirectD . If you own a Nexus 5X yourself, do drop us a comment if you’ve experienced any overheating issues or if you think your device smells funny. [ SOURCE ]"

Arif Lee,Malaysia’s broadband still lags behind,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/21/akamais-q3-state-of-the-internet-report-shows-malaysias-broadband-still-lags-behind/,"Akamai,broadband speed,Ericsson,Internet speed,Malaysia broadband speed,Malaysia internet speed,Singapore,Sri Lanka,Telekom Malaysia,Thailand,TM,Unifi","Cool stuff,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-12-21,"One of the leading content delivery networks (CDN) and cloud-based service providers, Akamai Technologies, has just released their global State of the Internet Q3 report and our data shows that we’ve dropped the ball in some areas. In terms of data presented, the Intelligent Platform gave us information regarding key metrics, as followed: connectivity speeds, broadband adoption rates, usage of IPv6 and added observations from Ericsson (a partner). Sitting at a lowly 73rd spot with an average speed of 4.9 Mbps, we fall behind neighbours Thailand (43rd) and Singapore (17th, while at the same time the Ceylonese Island of Sri Lanka betters us by 2 spots. YoY/Year on Year, we’ve made a steady improvement of 20% but there’s still much to be done. Our numbers show a slight 3.2% dip, based on Q2, possibly indicating a sudden surge of users subscribing to more affordable/slower plans, feeling the pinch from the economy or that our internet providers can’t keep up with demands, rolling out infrastructure slower than usual in this particular period. Interestingly, TM the major ISP in Malaysia revamped their plans in the month of October, leaving us to believe that Q4 will bring about more positive numbers. If you’re unaware TM is now offerings 30Mbps / 50Mbps download speeds but at a lower monthly fee – you can read about them  here . Looking at average peak connection speeds, we managed slightly better, at the 54th spot but our broadband providers still have room to improve. Our government has  allocated  RM 1.2 billion on expanding internet access points for non-urban locations, upping the current 5Mbps speeds to 20Mbps and we’re likely to see these measures starting to show in the coming year. According to Ookla’s speedtest report for Malaysia, it seems that our 4G LTE enabled network operators are capable of delivering speeds faster than fixed broadband. In developed markets, it should be the other way around.  The stark reality is that it’ll be hard to roll-out this basic need (by our standards) to rural areas, especially in East Malaysia – where even the major states have a lack of accessibility for high-speed broadband. An issue that still haunts most Malaysian users on TM’s network, is the fact that they’re still on Streamyx “broadband”, a lower-end network that offers slower speeds at a unappealing price. In retrospect, the most affordable Streamyx plan is offered at RM 116.60 per month for 1Mbps, which means it makes more sense for consumers to jump to UniFi, if it’s available in their area. Hopefully, we can only move onwards and upwards, hoping that eventually the basic networks infrastructures will be opened up for other competitors, making the internet more affordable for all of us.  [  SOURCE  ]"

The  Lenovo Vibe S1  with two selfie cameras has officially arrived in Malaysia. This mid-range device allows you to do more than just taking a standard picture of yourself.  The unique dual-camera concept is quite similar to HTC’s Duo Camera setup and Lenovo is taking it to the front seat for better selfies. It consists of an 8MP main camera and it is assisted by a 2MP secondary unit that helps with depth of field. This allows you to take creative blur shots with refocusing and bokeh effects.  It is a shame that it doesn’t come with a front facing flashlight. If you need to take better lit selfies, you can always pop-in an optional VIBE Xtension selfie flash that plugs into the headphone jack. For regular photoshoots, the rear of the Vibe S1 has a 13MP ybut with Phase Detection AF, and it is assisted by dual-tone LED flash.  As for the phone, it gets a 5″ Full HD IPS display and it is powered by a 64-bit MediaTek MT6752 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board, it gets a generous 32GB of storage which is expandable with microSD.  Like most smartphones today, it supports 4G LTE and has Dual-SIM slots. Keeping the lights on is a 2,500mAh capacity battery and overall it weighs 132 grams with a respectable thickness of 7.8mm. At time of writing, the Vibe S1 is running on Android 5.0 Lollipop. If you love taking selfies, this could be the device for you. However for those who prefer to take photos with the rear camera, the  Lenovo Vibe Shot  would be the better alternative as it comes with a 16MP main camera with Optical Image Stabiliser and Laser Auto Focus.  The Lenovo Vibe S1 is priced at RM1,299 and it comes in either Pearl White or Midnight Blue colour options. If you’re interested, you can get it from  GEMFive  at a discounted price of RM1,225."

With zero interest and zero upfront fees, you can own the latest Apple smartphone from RM100/month across a 24 months duration. At the moment, the Zerolution program for the iPhone 6s/6s Plus is only for the entry-level 16GB storage version. On top of that, it is only eligible if you sign up with their higher commitment MaxisOne Plan 158 or 188. To refresh your memory, the iPhone 6s (16GB) is priced at RM3,199 while the equivalent iPhone 6s Plus version is priced at RM3,699.  iPhone 6s 16GB

In total, that’s RM135/month for the iPhone 6s and RM156/month for the iPhone 6s Plus, excluding your monthly plan commitment.  The Maxis Zerolution program is a refreshing way of owning a device without the hefty upfront payments that come with traditional postpaid contracts.

We’ve just seen a spacecraft do the impossible, the first BIG step for man into space travel and smaller steps towards colonising Mars – Elon Musk’s long-term mission through SpaceX. Launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the Falcon 9 has just made huge advancements in reusable rockets. Let’s now talk about what SpaceX is all about. One of many of Elon Musk’s brainchilds, Space X is a private space company and they’ve done some amazing things – launching the Falcon 1 in 2008 being one of them, leading to NASA handing them a contract worth US$ 1.6 billion.  Fast-track through their history, the space capable delivery service (yes, we said it) has delivered 15 deliveries, some for NASA, and some for satellite missions. Though 6 months ago, SpaceX received a rude awakening, after 20 successful stints, the predecessor of the Falcon 9 blew up on the way up. So what did they do today that is such a big deal? They launched a rocket, went into orbit, released 11 satellites, floated sideways (in orbit), re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and made a successful propulsion based landing. It’s a big deal because once someone does (did) this, it translates to a major breakthrough for the aerospace industry. A mode of transportation that can be reused, over multiple occasions for travel but through space! Making future travel into space a whole lot cheaper. 
 This was the game-plan that the company laid out for the successful launch today: 
 *click for a bigger image* SpaceX just did something that was never done before by country-backed space programs – NASA, China and Russia included. These programs have spent an unimaginable amount of money to propel the human frontier into space and it has been more about showing who has the biggest “package” so to speak rather than bringing people to other planets. Successfully launching the Falcon 9 today, the company will continuously innovate their technology, eventually making the overall cost of space travel a lot cheaper in the long-run. Well I guess Musk’s mission of colonising Mars just got a lot more realistic.   Putting this scene in a much smaller scale: Looking forward, SpaceX will hope to allow people to buy a ticket to Mars for only US$ 500,000 – an anthill compared to the figure estimated by NASA back in 2004, US$ 10 billion per person. Their next step is making the Mars Colonial Transporter a reality, a spaceship that will hold at least 100 people. Musk hopes that by 2070, a high-tech metropolis will exist…. on Mars and we hope that it becomes a reality. Watch the whole spectacle here: [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"
Rory Lee,It looks like John Chen isn’t done pissing BlackBerry fans off,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/22/it-looks-like-john-chen-isnt-done-pissing-blackberry-fans-off/,"blackberry,BlackBerry PRIV,BlackBerry Priv discount,BlackBerry Priv price cut,John Chen,priv discount,Priv price cut","Android,BlackBerry,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Promotions",2015-12-22,"What do you do when one of your devices fails to meet sales targets? You take drastic measures, that’s what. Take a look at action camera maker GoPro’s  dramatic slashing of the GoPro Hero4 Session’s price , effectively halving its original USD400 price tag. It was simply too expensive for what it did and how it stacked up against GoPro’s own line, what more the competition. BlackBerry  CEO John Chen apparently has the same idea because he recently said that the company’s latest (and only) Android smartphone, the  PRIV , will be receiving a price cut next year. So, early PRIV adopters…oops? When everyone found out that the slider device would see an official launch in Malaysia, everyone began speculating on a price for BlackBerry’s flagship device. Simply converting its exorbitant American pricing of USD699 to our frankly depressing Ringgit, yielded a figure close to RM3,000 which caused some distress among the smartphone community. Then we found out that the  PRIV would be sold at RM3,559  and everyone went nuts. Why would anyone ever pay that much money for a smartphone? Privilege, BlackBerry says. It was the only BlackBerry device running Android…which made it just another Android smartphone, of which we have plenty and plenty that are better. Privacy, they added. It was supposed to be  Android’s state-of-the-art device  in terms of security…but it doesn’t even have a fingerprint sensor. I think we can start to see why this device didn’t do as well as they wanted it to. To make matters worse, the smartphone didn’t feel like it was RM1,000 more premium than any of the other Android flagships. Performance then? Nope, it is smooth, but so is every other flagship device. Aha! The PRIV brought BlackBerry’s physical keyboard over, a big plus point when it comes to BlackBerry phones! Uh, nope. Based on our hands-on with the device at the launch event, the keyboard felt a little too soft and was nowhere near as satisfying to type on as older BlackBerry phones. It seems then that the Hail Mary phone that was supposed to be  the saviour  for the Waterloo-based company, would instead end up being the  final nail in its coffin . Seems like dire straits for John Chen, so he recently made an announcement that the device would receive a price cut around the time of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which will be held from February 22 to 25. Due to the obvious fact that the other smartphone manufacturers would be releasing new devices, John Chen said that the PRIV would receive a “mid-life kicker” in addition to its price cut to hopefully remain competitive in the free market. He seems optimistic enough though, since he said that if the PRIV performs well, they will  launch an affordable mid-range device . John, maybe you should start with that next time. While we don’t think that they would halve the price the PRIV, we do hope that it receives a significant enough price cut to remain competitive. The thing is, even if they cut RM1,000 off its price, would you buy the PRIV over, say, a  Samsung Galaxy Note5  or a  Nexus 6P ? Do, let us know in the comments below because we know we wouldn’t.

What’s the point of having fast internet if you don’t have enough quota? That’s like having a Ferrari with a tiny fuel tank! The folks at Celcom apparently is aware of the increasing needs of its customers and they have just announced what they claim to be the greatest internet plans yet. How about 40GB of internet at just RM100 a month? Not to be confused with the  Celcom First Blue and Celcom First Gold  plans revealed  not too long ago , Celcom has introduced another similar sounding postpaid product that’s designed for data-only users. Basically for those needing a data SIM for their tablets and possibly MiFi devices.  The star of the show is the Celcom First Gold Internet plan that offers a whopping 40GB of internet. Before you get too excited, mind you that the actual mobile data is only 6GB and it gets an extra 4GB for weekend use (1GB per weekend).  The balance 30GB? That’s coming from off-peak (1am-7am) mobile data quota of 12GB and Celcom WiFi quota of 6GB plus additional 12GB WiFi quota for off-peak (1am-7am) use. Seriously who uses Celcom WiFi, let alone being able to access one during off-peak hours? Even the  WiFi coverage map  gives an impression that it’s as wide as their mobile network. If you’re a light data user, the Celcom First Blue Plan offers an accumulative 6GB of internet for RM45/month. Basically, this is the same perks as the  normal Celcom First Blue  postpaid plan for smartphones. Both First Blue Internet and First Gold Internet options let you carry forward unused data up to 2GB and 6GB respectively to the following month. Note that these new plans are data-only, so you can’t use it for phone calls, but strangely SMS is permitted.  According to Celcom, they will be offering bundled iPad contract plans from as low as RM1,268. The latest iPad Pro 128GB will be offered too but so far there’s no details from Celcom on its bundled pricing."

But their postpaid plans offer something we’ve never seen before, a profit-sharing mechanism that allows users to start own pyramid referral system, of sorts. The details on this XOX affiliate programme are still in the wind, with the website only stating that it “helps you grow your income without having to do very much at all. Or at least helping you in cutting your monthly phone bills in the simplest way!” You’ll find details of their postpaid plan below: When we called to find out how this system works, we were told to attend a “dealer orientation” – sketchy, at best. But if you’re interested in this program, head on over to their website (linked at the bottom) for more details. We’ve left out contact details and await a call from an XOX representative and we’ll be sure to let everyone know the outcome. Also to those wondering, XOX piggybacks on Celcom’s cellular network. Since we don’t usually see “pyramid” schemes and MLMs from telcos often (if at all), this inclusion could possibly add a peculiar twist to the Malaysian cellular operator market – then again, 2016 is already shaping up in a rather interesting manner, with TM entering the hypothetical mobile network ring. More competitors always means more choices, so maybe it’s time to jump ship, come 2016. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Many, ourselves included, felt that Microsoft shipped an unfinished product. From what we gathered, it isn’t the hardware that the Surface users are unhappy about, rather it was the software implementation that let the devices down. What’s worse, Microsoft’s “solution” to the problem was an apology on their forums which only served to irk more users. Now though, they seem to have actually come up with a solution to at least one of their problems. Besides the issues with the device’s power drainage during sleep and random reboots, one other nagging issue was the Surface device’s keyboard and touchpad. The much improved Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard was so advanced, it seemed, that it didn’t deem the Surface Pro 4 a worthy device and thus refused to pair with it properly. The Surface Pro 4 had issues connecting with its keyboard, especially when removing the Type Cover and reattaching it, bugging out the mouse cursors and other modes for Continuum. For us, the problems were more rudimentary when it came to the Surface Pro 4. We found out that if the keyboard was attached when the device was off, it wouldn’t detect the keyboard when we switched it on, forcing us to disengage and reattach the keyboard to the device. This update also affects Surface Book users, where apparently the device had problems with its touchpad and keyboard as well. Here are the  System hardware update: 12/17/15  changelogs: If you were anywhere near as excited as us for the launch of the Surface Pro 4, and dropped a considerable chunk of your savings to get one with the Type Cover keyboard, I’m sure you were equally crestfallen when you discovered that Microsoft already knew the device had issues yet still decided to put it in the market. While doing something like this is, frankly, unforgivable, you’d think that a company as big as Microsoft would have some kind of fix ready almost immediately after it put an unfinished product on sale. Instead, they said that major fixes would  only be coming next year . In any case, these problems seem to be software based, and fixable via updates so if you’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book device, our advice is to hunker down and weather this initial storm in the hopes that your device will eventually live up to its full potential. If you’re still on the fence about purchasing one, stay tuned to our upcoming review of the Surface Pro 4 where we will be taking a close look at the device, all of its problems, fixes and more.

Being relatively candid on the subject, Pichai jests that he’ll take his mum’s considerations when the time comes to name Android N, though it won’t only be her he’ll be looking to; supposedly, Google will also run an online poll to help decide if the N stands for Nougat, Nutella or something entirely different. Speaking mainly to an Indian crowd, one of the attendees asked about why there has never been an Android version named after sweets and desserts from India, Google’s CEO replied “When I meet my mom, I’ll ask her for suggestions” He added the following regarding the next nickname: “Maybe what I’ll do next time, is when we’re working on the next release of Android, Android N, maybe we’ll do an online poll on what the name should be. And if all Indians vote…. I think we can make it happen!” From the super sweet list below, it’ll be tough to see anything other than something sweet make the list: Android is widely adopted across the globe and while most of these nicknames have their namesake desserts/sweets originating from western countries, maybe Google will let globalisation do its own thing, allowing international sweets to be a part of the fun. Heck maybe when the list continues along the alphabet, you’ll see an Android  (O)nde-Onde  or Android  (P)isang Goreng  – okay that probably won’t happen but we’ll keep on wishing.

Customers have a choice of two Celcom  FIRST plans : the  FIRST Blue  and  FIRST Gold , both of which are designed to give you more data when you need it most. As you can tell by the colour, both data plans are designed for different users. For the more casual user, the Celcom FIRST Blue offers a monthly quota of 6GB of internet for only RM45 a month. The quota is split between three categories, where users get to have 2GB of monthly Internet, 2GB of free Internet on weekends (500MB every weekend), as well as 2GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi. The Celcom FIRST Blue plan also gives its users a cool 50 minutes of talktime and 50 free SMSs to all networks. Meanwhile, designed with the heavy user in mind, the Celcom FIRST Gold plan takes it up a notch, offering an accumulative Internet quota of 12GB each month. The quota, much like the FIRST Blue, will be split three ways which amounts to 4GB of monthly Internet, 4GB of free Internet on the weekends (1GB free every weekend) and 4GB of complimentary Celcom WiFi. Celcom FIRST Gold adopters will also receive double the talktime and free SMSs, at 100 minutes of talktime and 100 free text messages, to all networks. This means that if you sign up for any of Celcom’s FIRST plans, you can record a video of that beautiful sunrise from the top of Broga Hill and upload it to YouTube without worrying about it affecting your daily quota. It truly brings a great new meaning to separating business from pleasure. So go ahead and enjoy Celcom’s amazing 4G LTE speeds that will let you surf up to 10 times what you would normally get from a regular network connection. The good news doesn’t end there as Celcom FIRST subscribers will be entitled to free unlimited music streaming on Yonder Music. That means more awesome tunes streaming right to your phone so you get all the enjoyment without the headache of having to use up your precious smartphone storage. Better yet, if you have had a particularly economical month in terms of quota, Celcom FIRST rewards you by letting you carry over your unutilised monthly Internet to the next month. That means no more rushing to eek out every little bit of that quota near the end of the month! While most of you must be wondering if there is a catch, or perhaps even a contract to this plan, rest assured as Celcom doesn’t believe in tying you down with contracts for their FIRST data plans. As a testament to how committed Celcom is to providing its customers with a good deal, you can enjoy all of the fantastic privileges that come with the FIRST plan without the fear of being unable to terminate your plan due to a contract. Additionally, Celcom offers an extended credit limit of up to 5 times the extra credit limit of your monthly commitment value. With Auto Debit payments, you can also enjoy 5% savings over your monthly bill. Everything cool needs a club and Celcom’s FIRST plans are no exception. Subscribers will get to be part of the FIRST club which offers exclusive rewards and privileges designed only for club members, that range from additional free Internet calls, SMS and many more. What’s more, Celcom is having millions of movie ticket giveaways worth millions every month, letting you catch that epic year-end blockbuster movie without worrying about buying a ticket!

A couple of months back, AirAsia had introduced its  in-flight internet service  that runs on WiFi. For AeroMobile, you will be connected to an actual mobile network. This is like connecting to a roaming network while traveling overseas.  While there’s no mention of download speeds, you can enjoy surfing at RM32/day without the expensive pay per use charges. On AeroMobile, you can make and receive calls too but at a premium rate of RM15/minute. Meanwhile, SMS are charge at 99sen each.  Digi’s Head of Marketing Services had this to say on the matter: “Digi is committed in constantly improving our services. This service, coupled with our widest 4G LTE network, connects Malaysians with high-speed internet services even when travelling. Through this partnership with Malindo Air, our customers would be able to use their mobile devices onboard, empowering them to change the way they work, learn, play and live and provide them seamless connectivity.” This isn’t the first time Digi had offered in-flight service. Back in 2009, they had  introduced the service  on selected Malaysia Airlines flights but it costs a colossal RM100 per MB. Maxis is also an AeroMobile partner, but we can’t find further details on their website. Celcom is also  offering in-flight roaming service  and they support both AeroMobile (15 airlines) and OnAir (17 airlines) networks. However they charge a slightly higher RM38/day for each network.  Need to know how to get the service working on your device? Here are the super easy steps to get the service working. Do note that only selected flights are supported and the airline crew will make an announcement if the inflight mobile service is available.

Alexander Wong,Soon all Chinese smartphones might look the same,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/21/oppo-coloros-3-0-android-alpha-release/,"Android,ColorOS,ColorOS 3,ColorOS 3.0,MIUI,Oppo,OPPO OS","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-12-21,"Android is currently the most  popular mobile platform  and unlike Apple, it is driven by several device manufacturers. While the underlying operating system is the same, each brand would have their own customised skin to differentiate themselves from the rest.  For the regular consumer, the custom interface adds more value and nifty features which  doesn’t come stock standard . Of course, there are others that will consider pre-installed software as unnecessary bloatware, and proclaim plain vanilla is the way to go. Whichever side you pick, let’s take a look at the Chinese manufacturers.  With Apple seen as a status symbol, most of these Chinese smartphone UI lacks an App Drawer. Yes, it can be simple for first timers but power users might find it cluttered or annoying when it comes to organising their home screens. Of course, another popularity with Chinese Android UI is the wide availability of themes that you can customise to your preference. So Xiaomi has their MIUI, while Huawei has their very own EMUI. On the current version, EMUI looks awfully similar to Xiaomi’s own interface from the flat icon design, to the minimalistic approach for its built-in apps such as phone dialer, alarm clock, stopwatch, toggle switches and even the menu page. Even the shutdown menu interface that’s displayed after long pressing the power button looks the same as well.  Just recently, images of OPPO’s new ColorOS 3.0 has surfaced, and it looks awfully familiar with both custom interfaces. The photos you’re seeing here is an  OPPO R7 Plus  that runs on ColorOS 3.0.0_151216_Alpha. At first glance, it looks like another honor device if you didn’t notice the ColorOS and OPPO branding.  So far there’s no word of its release but it is likely to be running out of the box with their upcoming 2016 models. Disappointingly, it still runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop instead of the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow. At the rate these Chinese companies are going, they all might end up looking the same and the only difference is the exterior and the logo plastered at the back. What do you guys think? Do you fancy these app-drawerless interfaces or the mainstream offering from Samsung, HTC, ASUS and Sony? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Your CEO tells you to come to the office not in office attire but in beach wear, and he tells you to bring your passport and a packed suitcase. What do you do? So this happened at  Maxis . CEO  Morten Lundal  told all his staff to prepare for a beach holiday, which meant dressing up in beach wear, bringing a valid passport and packed suitcase, when they came to work on Thursday (Dec 17). On the day, Morten did an unplanned town hall and randomly picked the names of 13 lucky Maxis employees. All of them won an all-expenses VIP trip for two to Bali. Right after the announcement, the winners we’re chauffeured to KLIA and were soon on their way to Bali, just like that. It’s refreshing to see a company with such a fun and dynamic CEO like Morten. And those who got picked to go on the trip certainly got a huge morale boost. I like companies that do crazy things like this and I guess Morten subscribes to the belief that if you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of your customers. And if your customers are happy, your company should be doing ok. Some may disagree but I think Maxis is one of the better mobile operators in Malaysia. They are not perfect but they’re doing the right things. I hope the positive vibe that Morten is spreading to his employees carries through to the customer experience. And as a Maxis customer, I certainly wouldn’t mind getting a phone call from Morten out of the blue telling me that I got chosen to go on an all-expenses paid beach holiday. That would make me happy.

Rory Lee,HTC’s One X9 has one interesting camera “visor”,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/15/htcs-one-x9-has-one-interesting-camera-visor/,"Android,HTC,HTC One M9,HTC One X9,htc one x9 leak,rumour mill,smart phone,smartphone,smartphone leak","Android,HTC,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-15,"HTC is going through a rough patch lately. Not only did their flagship device lose out to high-end flagships from other manufacturers like  Samsung  and  Apple , it was also plagued with controversy as its Snapdragon 810 was running way too hot, all of which led to  plummeting sales . Then in hopes of pulling more sales, they launched the  One A9  which has been accused of looking  like a carbon copy of the iPhone 6/6s , though was rather well received by critics. On paper, the One A9’s specs were far from being a world beater, with only a Snapdragon 617 processor mated with 2GB of RAM, so it left many HTC fans who desired a worthy flagship wanting more. Then, the Taiwanese company gave fans another glimmer of hope when the  HTC One X9  leaked online with what  looked to be promising specifications . Now, more pictures of the device have also been leaked and it looks…different to say the least. Based on the pictures, the new addition to the One lineup looks to have a couple of very interesting design choices. The first, and most obvious of which, is that camera “visor” ala-Nexus 6P that stretches across the top of the device right around the camera module. When images of the Nexus 6P were first leaked and people saw the visor, they were a little apprehensive to it and how it seemed to have tainted what could have been a good looking device. Now though, that visor has become a signature of the latest Nexus device and at a glance, people can easily differentiate it from its less powerful brother the Nexus 5X. The thing is, while Huawei decided to set that visor apart, letting it dominate in its blackness across the top of the phone, HTC seems to have tried to “hide” their “visor” by painting it the same colour as the rest of the device. Again, apprehensive is the word we could best use to describe those looks. That said, taste varies between the individual so there obviously will be people who completely dig that look. Around the front of the device, HTC seems to have gone “retro” with the inclusion of capacitive buttons along the bottom of the device (where their logo usually is) while the HTC logo has moved to the device’s forehead. There also seems to be, what looks like, a pair of front facing speakers (which we hope are BoomSound speakers) as well as a front facing camera. The HTC One X9 recently  passed through Chinese certification authority TENAA . revealing what looks to be some frankly disappointing specifications. It looks like the device will be running an octa-core 2.2GHz processor (which rules out the Snapdragon 820 and Helios X20 rumoured earlier) mated with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD up to 1TB. The smartphone also looks to sport a 5.5″ full HD IPS display (1920×1080 pixels). In terms of optics, the device will get a 13MP primary camera with an LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. It is also rumoured to run Android 5.0.1 Lollipop (likely with HTC’s Sense UI on top) out of the box. To be fair, we couldn’t really expect this to be a full-fledged flagship device, especially since it doesn’t bear the M badge. One could hope, right? [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"
Alexander Wong,Microsoft Lumia 950/950 XL: Are these really made for productivity?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/16/microsoft-lumia-950-950-xl-malaysia-hands-on/,,,2015-12-16,"When Microsoft  introduced Windows 10 , they had embarked on a One Windows strategy. It aims to converge its latest operating system across a variety of devices, no matter what screen size you’re on. So this means all Windows Phones are simply called a Windows 10 mobile device. It has been a while since we’ve seen a flagship Lumia and the last one was the  Nokia Lumia 930  back in early 2014. After Microsoft took the helm of the mobile business, they are mostly preoccupied with entry to mid-range devices running on Windows Phone 8.1. After almost 2 years of waiting, the  Lumia 950  and  950 XL  have officially landed in Malaysia. Not only this is the first flagship Lumia under the Microsoft banner, but most importantly they are the first Windows 10 smartphones in the market. Like most flagships today, Microsoft is going with a two size approach for its flagship. The Lumia 950 with a compact 5.2″ display is going for RM2,699 while its larger 5.7″ “phablet” model, the Lumia 950 XL is priced at RM2,999. That’s a significant price jump over its predecessors, and you can partly blame our foreign exchange rates for that. The internals has the best specs you would expect from a flagship, which includes Quad HD displays, Snapdragon 808/810 processors, 3GB of RAM and a minimum of 32GB of storage. Both has an expandable microSD slot and dual-SIM slots with 4G LTE support. Being a flagship Lumia, it comes equipped with their renowned PureView camera. It has a 20MP sensor at the rear with triple LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front 5MP camera takes care of selfie duties. Keeping up with the times, it also shoots videos in 4K resolution. There’s fast charge that does 0-50% in 30 minutes, USB Type-C connectivity and Qi wireless charging support. The only difference between the 950 and its XL version is the screen size, processors (950 – Snapdragon 808, 950 XL – Snapdragon 810) and battery capacity (950 – 3,000mAh, 950 XL – 3,340mah). On concerns of overheating, Microsoft says they have implemented liquid cooling to keep things cool as the going gets tough."

Let’s face it, we’ve all wanted to be Jedi knights at some point in our lives but try as we might, there was no moving that cardboard box with our minds. Well,  Google  has the next best thing. Ahead of the official Malaysian premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Google has thrown together an interesting new Chrome web browser experience that lets you wield a lightsaber to fend off First Order Stormtroopers. The Lightsaber Escape game uses a simple mechanism that lets you wield your phone as if it was a lightsaber and slay Stormtroopers on either your laptop or computer in an attempt to escape a space station. Here’s how you play: Simply log on to the Lightsaber Escape  website  with your laptop or computer, then enter the URL displayed on the resulting web page into your phone. Once there, your phone should begin calibrating its accelerometer and upon completion, turn into the lightsaber it was always meant to be. You can then either play it on your computer’s monitor or cast/hook it up to a projector and have some theater level fun like we did. When you’re calibrated and past the tutorial mission, that’s when the real fun begins. The game takes you on an on-rail action adventure through a space station filled with Stormtroopers who happen to be surprisingly accurate. With your trusty lightsaber equipped, you will engage in ranged combat, where you deflect blaster fire back at your attackers,  as well as melee combat. We haven’t made it far enough into the game where we’ve encountered a Sith yet, so do let us know in the comments below if you have. It is a fantastic experience we highly recommend to anyone, Star Wars fan or otherwise especially since it works on both iOS and Android. We did encounter some input lag in our adventures through the game as well as some drops in framerate but that is kind of expected when playing a browser game. The experience in itself more than makes up for it though, so all is forgiven. Maybe by the next installment of the Star Wars franchise we will be able to play this (or something like this) in virtual reality. [ SOURCE ]"

They flooded the online stores on  Lazada  and  Vmall  which resulted in an impressive  1,000 Nexus 6P units sold on launch day  itself. However, purchasing anything online can be rather risky because sometimes, mix ups can happen. Local Ian Oz found this out the hard way. He, like many other Nexus 6P fans, ordered the device off Lazada’s website, however, when the package arrived, instead of unwrapping a brand spanking new smartphone, Ian unwrapped a pair of…earrings? Oh dear. 
 (click to enlarge) It turns out Lazada had somehow screwed up the order and sent Ian six pairs of earrings (worth RM58), which were initially meant for someone named Irene Yeow. The worst part was that based on the receipt, Irene’s earrings were meant to go Johor, which in case you didn’t know, is in another state. As it looks like Lazada had mistakenly stuffed the earrings into the Nexus 6P package, it seems likely that Ian’s smartphone was stuffed into the earrings package. The good news is that there is a contact number included in the shipping invoice. Ian, obviously outraged, took his irritation onto the social media, posting a picture of his receipt on Huawei’s Facebook page. Luckily, Huawei responded fairly quickly and ensured Ian that they had escalated the problem to their core fulfillment team and Lazada. What we don’t understand is how a mistake like this could be made in the first place. On the Pos Laju statement, it clearly states that the package should weigh 0.2kg (Nexus 6P weighs around 178g) which reflects the device’s weight, but it seems unlikely that six pairs of earrings would weigh the same as Google’s latest device. Nevertheless, paying RM58 for a brand new Nexus 6P seems like a phenomenal deal. Where can we sign up for it? In all seriousness though, we wish Ian luck in the retrieval of his device because we know how terrible it must feel to pay over two and a half thousand ringgit only for your shipment to be messed up. If you were thinking about getting the Nexus 6P, perhaps it would be wiser to purchase it from  Vmall.my , which is Huawei’s official online store. [ SOURCE ]"

All he wanted was to buy an iPhone 6, but instead, he was forced to fork out more than double the price by an unscrupulous seller.  Just when you thought nobody will pull the same trick here in Malaysia, think again. A local paper had reported several customers being held against their will until they pay up more than what was agreed upon.  A 28-year-old victim was reported to be buying 4 phones at RM200 each at Kota Raya Shopping Complex. However after making the payment of RM800, he was told to enter a secluded room where he was locked up for hours. He was then told to pay an exorbitant RM10,000 fee for his release. Eventually, the victim was set free, but not after he withdrawn RM5,000 from an ATM. To rub salt to the wound, the 4 phones which he got was different from what was shown earlier.  Obviously, the next thing to do was to report to the relevant authorities. He was said to have complained to several agencies including the Ministry of trade and Consumer Affairs, but no action has been taken. As a last resort, he seeks help from PPIM (Persatuan Pengguna Islam Malaysia) which proceeded to raid the shop.  From the operation, it was found that there are a number of phone shops at Kota Raya that are selling counterfeit products at skyrocketed prices. In total, they had managed to cover as much as RM11,900 on behalf of 7 victims. Apart from locals, these shops tend to target foreigners especially women that would often fall prey to such tactics. As always, it is advisable to shop at reputable retailers and beware of dodgy dealers that offer unbelievable deals. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. This isn’t just limited to expensive phone models as we’ve seen  fake Xiaomi devices  in the market as well. If you’re planning to get a smartphone, it is best to visit an authorised dealer or order directly from the official online store. Hopefully you won’t get a surprise like  this poor chap .

Yet, it’s nice to see Malaysians are all over the place when it comes to wanting to find out about current affairs, both internationally and locally. Cited as the Top Trending Searches for 2015, we’re perplexed as to why the most searched “term” in the country was “HRMIS 2.0″, an internal system used by those in the (extremely large 1.5 million people) public service. Though you’d think that a frequently visited site used for work would deserve a bookmark or at least remembrance of the URL. Moving on, there were searches regarding BR1M 2015, the annual subsistence handout by our government; How-Old.net, an application that tells you how old it thinks you are (duh); and some local shows/movies. No surprise as the “USD to MYR” was searched highly too, followed by “GST” and the “Bersih 4.0″ rally. For the top 10 most searched individuals list, it seemed that Malaysians looked for information regarding notable people who passed away during the year. That includes, the late: Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore; Paul Walker, the famous actor that passed away during a car crash; and Kevin Morais, the murdered deputy prosecutor. Our current Prime Minister was also on the list, while athlete Farah Ann Abdul Hadi made her way on it as well (for obvious, gymnastic attire reasons). People also kept up with international news, as searches for the missing QZ8501 airplane, the Paris Attacks and ISIS, topped the list for trending news searches. The list of searches really show what we’re looking for, be it happenings of the world or an important individual. Given the growth of the Internet and Google being one of the go-to search engines (seriously, who still uses Yahoo or Bing?), we’ll continue to see what sort of information our country is keen to look for, hopefully John Cena won’t make the list again next year.

It makes sense though as smartwatches tend to be rather gargantuan to accommodate more screen real estate, resulting in big and bulky devices that don’t go well with everyone’s wrist. Huawei  has caught on this trend as well, as there are reports coming in that there will be a “for women” version of their new  Huawei Watch . While it is unlikely that there will be any upgrades on the internals of the smartwatch, there will be aesthetic differences because the new watch will apparently be rounder. Yep, rounder than a round watch. Apparently the new Huawei watch will sport a modified “rounder and more elegant” watch case to match the supposedly more feminine-looking bands that will be bundled with it. If they plan on following the generic his/her accessories trend then the device will likely be smaller in both their bands as well as the watch case itself. It should probably also come in gold and maybe pin-uh sorry, Rose gold as well. The existing Huawei Watch is no small device as it has a rather thick case to go along with that premium hefty feel. This definitely won’t go down well with delicate wrists, so a smaller and especially thinner design language will be much appreciated. This “made-for-women” Watch could see a launch during CES next year. Talk has been going around that the Chinese manufacturer’s second-generation smartwatch is already in the works and could see its way into the market by the second half of next year. There are hardly any details on this smartwatch at this point in time, but 9to5Google reports that they could be working on a cellular version of the device. This is unsurprising news though as  Android Wear  now officially supports cellular connectivity. The regular, non-cellular version of the Watch should also see improvements to battery life and performance. Announced during the Mobile World Congress this year, Huawei’s first generation Watch was only recently launched in Malaysia, alongside the  Nexus 6P . We were mighty impressed with its premium feel and we thought it was one of the best-looking smartwatches of the year.

It also gets the same 13MP f/1.9 shooter with OIS as the rest, however the front gets an upgrade to 8MP for higher resolution selfie shots. On-board storage is said to be atleast 32GB with the option to expand further with microSD. The home button also comes with an integrated fingerprint scanner which can be used for Samsung Pay.  The Galaxy A9 is expected to be available in China by end of this month or early January next year with an estimated price tag of 3,000CNY (about RM2,000).  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

A few months ago, they had unveiled the  OnePlus X , a 5″ smartphone with mid-range specs.  Since the OnePlus 2 would be their flagship killer for 2016, it is safe to say they won’t be rushing to replace it anytime soon. Instead, it seems like they are working on a mini flagship smartphone that could go head on with the  Sony Xperia Z5 Compact . According to its listing on  Geekbench , the new OnePlus device has a compact 4.6″ display that pushes full HD (1920×1080) resolution. It also gets the same Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor as the OnePlus 2, as well as 4GB of RAM for all your multitasking needs. On-board the list shows 64GB of storage which is quite huge for a device of this class. The main camera appears to be a 13MP shooter that supports 4K, while the front gets a 5MP unit. No mentions if it has Laser AF assist like its bigger brother. At the moment, the device is running on Android 5.1.1 and you can expect it to run on their own stock-like OxygenOS when it is out. Like the current OnePlus 2, it also lacks NFC. Would you be interested in a compact 4.6″ flagship smartphone? What is your preferred smartphone size? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Did we mention? This will be the first time you’re seeing Continuum: a PC-like experience on your Lumia 950 or 950 XL via Display Dock and Windows 10 on any smartphone. The question is, will it change Microsoft’s success in the local market? Let’s see if Digi enterprise/business customers take advantage of this special deal. The smaller of the two, the Lumia 950 will be absolutely free of charge though it’ll come with a hefty monthly fee of RM 238 on a 2 year (24 months) contract – working out to a huge RM 5,712 total. It isn’t just for the phone, as you’ll be getting 10GBs of mobile data, totally unlimited calls, text and instant messaging (WhatsApp and WeChat). If you’d prefer something bigger and more powerful, the Lumia 950 XL will be available too. You’ll get the same plan as talked about above, at the same monthly price, but you’ll have to fork out an additional RM 330 upfront for the smartphone itself; bringing you to an eventual RM 6,042 total cost. Given that spending RM 238 per month doesn’t sound as practical for someone who doesn’t use all that bundled data, calls/texts and instant messaging, you can bump that price down by choosing other Digi plans that will be announced on the 18th of December; mind you, the two smartphones’ will cost more, but you’ll be paying less monthly. During the same announcement, Digi mentioned that this collaboration will bring about a third (more affordable) device, the Microsoft Lumia 550, that will be free on the Digi SmartPlan 98. It’ll be available slightly later, at the end of December of this year. Head on over to our  announcement post  for a full recap of what these Windows 10 devices have to offer, as well as their full specs."

Well, it’s a good thing it wasn’t “ soon ™ ”  because Google has begun the rollout for Maps offline navigation on iOS. Huzzah! As the initial rollout began on Android, many countries were initially left out, including Malaysia and it wasn’t until the second-half of last month that availability was  extended to our home soil as well . Now, it has finally been made available to iOS users as well with the latest update to the Google Maps app. The downloaded maps will be stored for 30 days with the option to update it either automatically via WiFi or mobile network/WiFi, or manually. By default, the application will update maps over WiFi automatically. To navigate, simply search for the location in the application (as you normally would) and if it falls within your downloaded area, simply hit the little car icon and then hit the little arrow key and the turn-by-turn navigation will launch and start guiding you. Besides offline navigation, the application also supposedly brings the option to view petrol prices and when local businesses are supposed to be busy, but from our testing, it doesn’t appear to work in Malaysia. Then again, the ability to view petrol prices doesn’t really matter here since it is standardised across all stations. In any case, this will surely put a smile on iOS users’ faces (ironic that it would be Google to do so) as they now have another choice for reliable offline navigation in Malaysia. [ SOURCE ]"

Announced during IFA 2015, the Acer Predator 8 has finally arrived in Malaysia.  Sporting a 8″ Full HD (1920×1200) display, this is Acer’s compact tablet with the gamer in mind. It gets a gaming inspired aluminium frame and has not one, not two but four front-facing speakers with Dolby Audio enhancement. For a more immersive gaming experience, the Android tablet has two haptic motors inside that rumbles on both ends.  Powering the device is Intel’s Atom x7-Z8700 2.4GHz Quad-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. Onboard, it gets 32GB of storage which you can expand via a microSD up to 128GB. The Predator 8’s IPS display claims to have 100% NTSC colour gamut that provides a vibrant and accurate colour reproduction. The included MediaMaster settings let you optimise the display and audio for gaming, movie, photo viewing and standard modes.  The main highlight, of course, would be its Predator Quadio (Quad Audio) setup that offers a virtual surround sound. Whether you’re holding it in landscape or portrait mode, it is smart enough to switch orientation automatically.  Despite its chunky utilitarian appearance, it is 8.7mm thin and weighs 350 grams including its 4,420mAh battery. It does feel solid in the hands while the red coloured speaker grills protrude out from each corner to remind you that this is no ordinary tablet. There’s no 3G/4G mobile connectivity, but it has your usual Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and 802.11n WiFi with 2×2 MIMO support.  Should you need to take pictures, it gets a 2MP shooter at the front while the rear gets a 5MP camera. At time of writing, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. The Acer Predator 8 will go on sale in Malaysia starting next week with the retail price tag of RM1,499. To get your game on, they have also pre-installed Asphalt 8 with 320,000 credits worth US$50."

Hold on a minute, the latest Android hasn’t even gone mainstream but they want to talk about the future? Representing Google during an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session, the 6-man team chipped in on a slew of topics, including: the direction of Pixel C and the future of Android. If you’re asking why there’s such a bridging of the two; it’s mainly due to a merger that’s reported to take place come 2017. The report suggests that heads at Google think combining the two makes the most sense, since Android has had an early start as an operating system for quite some time. And we’re already starting to see small changes that point towards a unification in latest Pixel product. Google’s Pixel branding has been have over the place, of late; partly due to the Pixel C choosing Android over Chrome OS. This further points to a crossover of operating systems and that might mean more “desktop”-like capabilities to ease productivity in the following phase of Android. So while mediating all these unanswered questions regarding the switch, the software team thought it would be a great idea to hold an AMA session. Allowing users to ask whatever they needed to. But it was surprising that the developers choose to share two facts about Android N, given that non-Nexus devices have yet to receive Marshmallow. The first of the two is a proper split-screen/multi-window function that we’ve already seen on iOS (iPad Pro only) and some Android OEM skins as well. This pretty much only applies to tablets since it’ll be a tiresome experience navigating multiple windows on your smartphone screen. Another feature that came about was DisplayPort via USB Type-C connector, that a competitor has put to good use – yes, we’re looking at Windows with their Continuum support. A trend that you could see a mile away, with more people dropping PCs for day to day task and opting convertibles that are slowly catching up in the processor department. These replies below were from the team themselves: Faster processors in smaller packages are already here and they’ll only continue to get better. And you can expect us to start using smaller devices on bigger screens real soon. Oh and maybe a Pixel smartphone? Let us know what you make of this announcement and share with us if your technological consumption habits have changed of late, in the comments below. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

The new flagship smartphones are expected to be announced during MWC 2016 and they are likely to retain a duo release of a standard and an “edge” version that comes with a curve screen. We’ve seen a couple of  speculations  for the Galaxy S7 and a new report by WSJ has reaffirmed what we know so far. According to their sources, the Korean maker will be implementing a pressure sensitive display that’s very much like Apple’s iPhone 6s/6s Plus. Based on a  patent  filed by Samsung, the display allows you to alternate between space/tab, upper/lower-case keys according to the pressure of your touch. Also introduced for the first time in their product line is a high-speed charging/transfer port via USB Type C. Probably a much-welcomed feature is the likely return of a  microSD slot . This year Samsung has gotten brickbats from its users for dropping expandable storage for its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5. The expandable slot is said to be available on specific models, and it won’t be included across all flagship models. In terms of cameras, Samsung will be introducing its new  BRITECELL sensors  that boast better low light performance. If you hate camera bumps. the new shooter is said to be flush with minimal protrusion at the back. As an extra party trick, Samsung might just include a Retina Scanner to unlock your device and we’ve seen ZTE implementing such feature on the  Axon . Design wise, Samsung is expected to stick to its winning formula of using metal and glass. Its choice of using premium materials had helped Samsung to move upmarket and it was a huge leap from its former plasticky smartphones of old. Don’t expect a radical change in appearance but perhaps some minor tweaks to differentiate the Galaxy S7 from its existing models. If the Galaxy S7/S7 edge launches in February, we might be able to see them in stores locally as early as end March or early April. [  SOURCE   2  ]"

Competition is always good for us consumers and this could be a wake-up call to existing operators to buck up, or risk losing its customers.  So in total, you’ll have Celcom, Digi, Maxis, U Mobile and TM as the 5 key 4G LTE telcos in the country. Is that enough? Well, it appears a new player is about to jump into the ring. 5 years ago, the Malaysian government had allocated 2,600MHz LTE spectrums to  9 companies . Only 4 of them had officially rolled out commercial services namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. With TM’s  acquisition  of P1, they now have access to the 2600MHz spectrum which they can roll out full LTE based telephony and data services. This is different from  TMgo , a wireless broadband service that operates in a lower 850MHz frequency. If you run a manual network search lately, you probably would notice a new network bearing the number 502 152. This was spotted at several locations including Seremban, Shah Alam and Damansara Heights. At some locations, you could detect 502 153.  For those who are clueless about the numbers, these are Mobile Network codes. According to MCMC, 502 152 belongs to YTL Communications while 502 153 belongs to Packet One Networks. We haven’t heard much from YTL Communications in a while and they could be making a big come back next year with 4G LTE. Their Yes 4G WiMAX service is still alive and running with occasional  device bundle  promotions.  So what’s the big deal if YTL launches its LTE service? Almost 2 years ago, YTL was  reported  to be testing  TD-LTE  on 2.3GHz, which supposedly is more efficient in bandwidth and cost. Utilising Time Division instead of Frequency Division, TD-LTE requires just one channel for download/upload as opposed to having a pair of frequencies for the same purpose.  In Malaysia, our existing telcos are running on FDD-LTE, while TD-LTE is commonly used in China and India. Whether  TD-LTE is better than FDD-LTE  boils down to the telco itself. It is not what you have, but how you manage your network and your customer experience.  Seamless transition from WiMAX, is also a factor why YTL favours TD-LTE. In an interview last year, its CEO Wing K Lee says that their WiMAX network is  future proof  and it won’t cost much for them to roll out LTE. Back then, YTL is claiming 85% population coverage with WiMAX and we can confirm it was definitely wider than P1 in our road test conducted exactly  5 years ago . If they could light up LTE nationwide at a flick of a switch, YTL could be a serious rival to  Digi  and  Maxis . What do you guys think? Thanks  @ZikriMzd  for the tip! [  SOURCE  ]"

These issues cropping up are a follow-up to the shambles that was Microsoft’s style of dealing with its angry OneDrive customers, that showed that their customer service approach has a lot of refining to be done and this time, it seems like deja vu all over again. Josh_F a forum owner took to Microsoft’s Community site to provide an official statement from the team at Redmond and the reply is rather lackluster. The moderator starts off by thanking those who own the two Surface devices mentioned above, proceeding to dish out the monotonous recording playback-like sentence “we’ve heard your complaints, we value them and are working on a fix” – y’know the typical sentiments. Some of these problems were fixed with an update that users received in November but with that said update, devices started to drain battery percentage faster while in sleep mode. A fix to this will only come next year, though Microsoft was already aware of the issue before they shipped the two products – say what? We’ve said this time and time again, never fast-track a product if it’s riddled with bugs; case and point the LG Watch Urbane 2nd gen. This was what another moderator ( Joe ) had to say:  “ The ‘standby’ battery life is an issue we are working on and have been working on.  We can put the processor into a deeper sleep state than it is currently set to.  We couldn’t do it at RTM (release to manufacturing) for a variety of reasons, power management is a very hard computer science problem to solve especially with new silicon.   Currently it is not in the deepest “sleep” that it can be so there are wake events that would not otherwise wake it.  We will have an update for this issue sometime soon in the new year.” These excuses and justifications pose no help to those who’ve already purchased the versatile Surface products. In earnest, we really do hope that the Surface team solves these issues, otherwise our review isn’t going to be rosy. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

As a whole we’re pretty fascinated by it and the experience it provides so when we finally got the update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, we were pretty stoked. Although it really wasn’t a major update, we thought we’d give you guys a brief run-down on what you can expect out of this little update. As the name suggests, this isn’t a very big update but there are several little tweaks that are fairly interesting. The first of which is the addition of new emojis. Now we finally get access to the head bandaged emoji, the updated poop emoji and the ever useful eye-roll emoji. If you want more information on these emojis,  Ars Technica has a pretty comprehensive list . Besides that, this update acts as a catch-up update for older Nexus devices, bringing the Nexus 6P’s double-tap-on-the-power-button-to-wake-the-camera shortcut to the  Nexus 6 ,  Nexus 5  and  Google’s Nexus tablets . Though unrelated to the Nexus 6P, according to  TrustedReviews , 6.0.1 brings more improvements to the Nexus tablet user. Before this update, the back, home and multitask keys were always located in the middle, which made things tricky for tablet users to actually reach the buttons when holding a tab in both hands. Now, the back and home keys have been pushed to the far left corner of the screen while the multitasking key has been shoved to the far right. All of those plus Google’s monthly security update pretty much sums up this new patch. We will be keeping a close eye on any future updates so do stay tuned to SoyaCincau.com for all your Nexus 6P needs."
Rory Lee,To Mate or Note to Mate,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/09/huawei-mate-s-vs-samsung-galaxy-note5/,,,2015-12-09,"Premium. The one description, be it on the spec sheet or in the build quality, most people sought after when going for a smartphone. With technology getting more and more advanced, the premium feel has begun to spill down the price pyramid to the point where even midrange phones can give users that “premium feel”. However, these lower end “premium” smartphones usually come with some corners cut to keep the price low. I love a great bargain, phones like the  OnePlus One  or the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 , have great specs for their price, but you can clearly see what was left out. Today though, it isn’t about the best value for money. Today, it’s about two phones that sit close to the top of the price point hierarchy, an echelon where there can be no compromises because anything lower than the best would be unacceptable. Today is about the  Huawei Mate S  and the  Samsung Galaxy Note5 . As these devices are priced so similarly (RM2,698 for the Mate S and RM2,699 for the Galaxy Note5) the question most people are interested in is “which do I buy?”. Well, we’re pitting these two behemoths against each other in a head-to-head comparison to help you answer that question a little better. Let me be clear upfront, I won’t go over every detail of each device, rather the devices will be judged on how premium or special they make you feel. If I were going to shell out over two and a half thousand ringgit on a device, I want to make sure that the device is absolutely the best device in every single aspect I could ever purchase with that kind of money. That’s a tall order, but I’m sure if you were going to blow your savings on a purchase like this you wouldn’t settle for anything less. With that out of the way, onwards into the field of battle!"

A term, to the layman, that is commonly associated with a certain ugly vehicular abomination that claims to be green and is well loved by Hollywood actors who want to appear environmentally conscious. Cameron Diaz has one y’know. In tech, it is also a term that has been gaining popularity because it usually means you can afford to carry one less device around with you. Yup, we’re talking about hybrid laptops and tablets. Or the laptop cum tablet. Or the tablet cum laptop. Or a “convertible”. Well, that’s what  Google  is calling their latest device, the  Pixel C , and yup you’ve guessed it, the C stands for convertible. It’s not just a tablet, it’s a  tablet AND a keyboard . Wow. 
 
Ribbing aside, the Pixel C does have an impressive spec sheet. At the front, the device sports a 10.2-inch 2560×1800 pixel display that achieves a 308ppi pixel density. On the inside, it is running a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 chip with 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The Pixel C will come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box, abandoning the Chrome OS normally found in other  Chromebooks . This is a strong indication that the  merging of Chrome OS and Android  is probably well on the way. The device also charges its 9,000 mAh battery via USB Type-C. It also sports an 8-megapixel rear camera that supports 1080p recording and a 2-megapixel front camera, but we do advise against being one of those “tablet photographers”. The tablet attaches to its keyboard via magnets, but the thing that we found great was the fact that the keyboard has a solid base which means you can use it on your lap. For more information on the tablet and its keyboard, head on over  here . Marketing it as a tablet with a keyboard means that the Pixel C was not exactly designed to be a hybrid laptop or tablet. And that kind of shows since it is running Android instead of a dedicated laptop/desktop OS. Clearly it  isn’t meant to replace your laptop  but we do hope that ChromeOS-Android hybrid comes soon so that we can see what this tablet is fully capable of. Of course, this isn’t the first tablet to come with its own keyboard. Sony has done it with the Xperia Z4 Tablet, Samsung has Galaxy Tab S, ASUS has the Transformer, and even Google themselves have the Nexus 9 with a keyboard. The Pixel C is currently available in the Google Store with prices starting at USD499 (around RM2,130). The magnetic keyboard is a USD149 (around RM635) optional extra, but it does also come with a folio keyboard, similar to the Nexus 9’s and will also be priced at USD149. Based on these figures, the Pixel C looks like its a pretty good bargain, especially if you compare it with the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet which will set you back RM2,699 for the device and another RM799 for the accompanying keyboard. Unfortunately, the Pixel C isn’t available in Malaysia. As of this moment there doesn’t seem to be any information on availability in our market but we do hope they will bring it over soon so that we can see first hand what Google thinks is the proper way to build a tablet.

While numbers don’t lie, it’s been a strenuous journey for the operating software; coming to life thanks to a team of four visionaries. The Nexus name came shortly after, allowing devs and those passionate about the cleanest, bloat-free system that they could tinker away with, within their coding laboratories. Notable house-hold OEMs have had their hand in the growing appreciation that is, a Vanilla flavoured Android OS; a list that include two Korean manufacturers (LG and Samsung), one Taiwanese (HTC), one American (Motorola) and the rookie to the bunch, the Chinese-based  Huawei  with their  Nexus 6P . What Huawei brings to the Nexus name? Can Huawei add a new spin to the Nexus name after leaving many hoping for more after the Nexus 6?

Those who felt betrayed after the Nexus 5, were left hanging, while those wanting something top-of the line without sacrificing quality materials and build were put in the same position. So now we have the Nexus 6P, a smartphone that many have said to be the best pure Android device to date, but can the device and Marshmallow appeal to the mass market? Will it please the average consumer that prefers to purify their experience? Whatever your opinion, the newest Nexus might just surprise you."
Alexander Wong,"Fancy a metal-clad Redmi Note 3? You can get it now for under RM1,000",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/10/redmi-note-3-malaysia-on-sale-imported/,"Android,DirectD,Dual Sim,Redmi Note 2,Redmi Note 3,Redmi Note 3 Malaysia,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Redmi Note 3","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-12-10,"Just shortly after the  Redmi Note 2  was announced in Malaysia, Xiaomi had introduced a newer yet upmarket successor, the  Redmi Note 3 . Released after their epic Single’s Day sales, the Redmi Note 3 has a more premium unibody metal design, upgraded specs, a fingerprint scanner and also the largest battery for a Xiaomi smartphone.  If you can’t wait for Xiaomi Malaysia to bring it here officially, the folks at DirectD has started offering imported units under RM1,000.  Available in two variants, the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage base model is going for RM859, and they have both Silver and Gold colour in stock. If you need something with more grunt, the higher spec 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage version in Silver only is available at RM999.  The rest of the specs are almost identical with the current Redmi Note 2. The front display is a 5.5incher that does Full HD resolution while processing is handled by MediaTek’s Octa-Core Helio X10 processor. The cameras appear to be unchanged with a 13MP PDAF camera at the rear while the front gets a 5MP shooter. While the battery isn’t removable this time, the Redmi Note 3 gets a huge 4,000mAh capacity battery while still maintaining a slender 8.65mm profile. It also gets 4G LTE support with dual-SIM but sadly there’s no microSD expansion slot with the Redmi Note 3. Also new for Xiaomi is a fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks instantly on a single tap. Out of the box, it runs on MIUI 7 that’s based on Android Lollipop.  As a reference, the Redmi Note 3 in China is going for 899 CNY (about RM596) for the lower spec unit and 1,099 CNY (about RM728) for the high-spec version. If the extra premium of about RM260-270 for an import set is reasonable to you, you now have the option to get one today. Otherwise, you could settle for the Redmi Note 2 which is now available with special bundles during its  Christmas sale . If you’re interested, head over to DirectD’s  Redmi Note 3  page.

Wow, where have we seen that before? In any case, the device does pack some mighty specs as it sports Apple’s monstrous A9X chip with 4GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. All of these “laptop replacement” specifications come at a cost though as the 32GB WiFi base model (without the keyboard and Apple Pencil) will set you back RM3,599, whereas the top-end device with 128GB of internal storage and cellular + WiFi connectivity options will cost RM4,899 with GST. On the other hand, Maxis is offering the high-end 128GB with WiFi and Cellular connectivity for RM3,982 (device only) if you purchase it with a 24-month Maxis SurfMore50 plan. The SurfMore50 plan comes with 2GB of Internet quota and will cost RM50 a month.

There are some of us at SoyaCincau.com who feel the same way and then there are those who simply cannot comprehend how paying so much for a device that comes with, what essentially is the “outline” of the Android OS, could be justified. We don’t like letting those without a voice go unheard, so we had an extensive discussion and compiled a list of reasons why vanilla Android is the only Android you DON’T want to have. Do keep in mind that this list is tailored to the average, inexperienced consumer who wouldn’t root their brand new Nexus device and play around with custom ROMs lest it becomes a two and a half thousand ringgit aluminium brick. We do like a near stock experience, but we also can’t deny that there are many luxuries that come with the Android skin on most devices these days that we almost couldn’t live without. Of course, this list isn’t for everyone, so fanatical purists, turn away! Everyone else, allons-y!"

Supposedly, the render shows that Xiaomi will be ditching the trio of capacitive buttons, taking the middle out of the equation. In place will apparently be Xiaomi’s first physical home button, while it’ll integrate a fingerprint sensor inside. Redmi Note 3 pictured above The Chinese smartphone maker has done some odd things in the past, so we’re not counting out this render just yet. But it’ll be a very different route from what we saw on their first device with a fingerprint sensor – the Redmi Note 3, that places the sensor on the rear. Tying it all together, these images come just after a reputed analyst shared his thoughts on the Mi 5’s fingerprint technology. Pan Jiutang shared that the device won’t have the latest UltraSonic Fingerprint Scanner technology by Qualcomm, as it’s still in the developmental stages. Leaving the impression that it’ll likely be the same scanners you’d see in other manufacturers’ devices. Spotted carrying some heavy hitting internals under the codename Xiaomi gemini, which include a Snapdragon 820 chipset while running Android Marshmallow; it’s likely we’ll see the Mi 5 early next year and its accompanying leaks as the new year unfolds.

Now in its 7th generation, Google has partnered with Huawei with the all new  Nexus 6P . It isn’t just another reference device but an upmarket one that could very well compete with the current crop of flagship smartphones. After its  announcement  in late September, the Nexus 6P is finally here in Malaysia and you can place your orders beginning this Thursday, 10th December. Available in a single 64GB storage variant, the Nexus 6P is priced officially at RM2,698 inclusive of GST. For Malaysia, we are getting two colour options – Aluminium and Graphite. So far there’s no news of its other Gold and Frost White versions. In terms of size, the Nexus 6P despite its “6” moniker has a 5.7″ screen which makes it more compact than last year’s Nexus 6 by Motorola. The AMOLED screen pushes a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 that gives a pixel density of 518 pixels per inch. The exterior is where the Nexus 6P stands out. It gets an all-metal unibody design with a “helmet visor” bump at the back that houses its camera module. Accompanying its high-resolution screen is a pair of stereo speakers which is perfect for gaming and audio playback. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P also gets a fingerprint scanner at the back that’s natively supported by Android Marshmallow. Like most rear-mounted fingerprint scanners, it unlocks instantly in a single touch. Powering the device is a flagship class 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of RAM, which should be more than sufficient to provide a buttery smooth experience. Like all Nexus smartphones (except for the Nexus One by HTC), there’s no expandable microSD slot and it comes with a single nano SIM slot supporting 4G LTE. In terms of cameras, the Nexus 6P focuses on larger pixels rather than the usual pixel count. Despite having a 12.3MP sensor from Sony, it boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size that allows in more light and this apparently is good enough to compensate for the lack of an Optical Image Stabilisation. It gets a dual-tone LED flash, Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus so that you won’t miss a shot. Over at the front, selfies are taken care by its rather large 8MP shooter. Keeping the lights on, the Nexus 6P has a generous 3,450mAh battery and it charges up via a reversible USB Type C port. Out of the box, you get 2 sets of cables – a USB Type-C to Type-C and the standard USB Type-C to full sized USB. The power adapter pushes a higher 3Amp output through a USB Type-C port which should be faster than standard 2Amp chargers in the market. Of course the main reason why anyone would get a Nexus, is for its pure Android experience without the unnecessary fluff that’s often preinstalled by OEMs. The Nexus 6P will be available online this Thursday (10th December) through Huawei’s  vmall.my  and  Lazada  Online store. Those who snap up units quickly, Huawei will be throwing in an introductory offer of a  Chromecast  (the first version) worth RM 199, totally free of charge to the first 600. The Nexus 6P also comes with a 1 year one-to-one swap program through Huawei Service Centres.

This matrimony of the Android operating system and the security plus convenience of BlackBerry’s own operating system comes in a premium body with a curved display that will surely appeal to existing mainstream smartphone users. The PRIV does have a trick up its sleeve though as it features a physical QWERTY keyboard that slides out from under its display. This slide out keyboard also functions as a touchpad for scrolling that makes text selection quicker and more accurate. There is also a text prediction feature that lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. BlackBerry’s PRIV is the largest device the ever manufactured by the Waterloo corporation and comes with a 5.4″ quad-HD panel, that is curved every so slightly, similar to  Samsung’s Galaxy S6 edge  and  Galaxy S6 edge+ . Spec-wise, the device runs an octa-core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of ram and 32GB of internal storage. Storage is expandable via microSD up to 2TB, assuming you ever find cards with that much storage. Powering the device is a relatively large 3,140 mAh battery and it also runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. The bonus feature is that the PRIV comes with a host of BlackBerry productivity apps including a unified Hub. In terms of optics, the device features an 18-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and a dual-LED flash. It is also certified by Schneider-Kreuznach. Unfortunately, the PRIV only receives a 2-megapixel selfie-panorama front facing camera for selfies, which we’re sure may disappoint some. However, cameras aren’t all about optics, so we will have to see how good this 2MP shooter is. Many expect the PRIV to be a game changer as it is supposed to bring the best of both Android and BlackBerry operating systems together in a premium device. Well, it certainly has to be a game changer because BlackBerry CEO has stated that the company is relying heavily on the PRIV to do well for them to stay afloat. If you want to get your hands on this device, you can preorder the PRIV at a discounted price of RM3,388 for the first 60 customers on  11street.my , or head over to any Celcom Blue Cube outlets to preorder for the same price until the 14th of December. Alternatively, you can try your luck with  11street’s shocking bid  from as low as RM1. The device will be available from 15 December onwards and will retail for RM3,559. That’s a hefty price to pay for this device, no matter how premium. Would you shell out that kind of money for this device?

With the current generation of smartphone cameras breaking barriers and capable of some amazing photographs, given the right conditions; what does the flagship Nexus have to offer? Utilising Sony’s lens on the rear and front, the device in question doesn’t boast an amazing pixel count, only at 12.3-megapixel. It also doesn’t have optical image stabilisation, which by today’s standards could be a big no-no Google does however bet on the sensors large pixel size, listed at 1.55 µm to compensate the fact that the lens has no Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). A combination of an aperture of f/2.0 and the larger micrometre would mean that it’ll absorb a lot more light, at least on paper; making shots in low light scenes easier to manage. Also, PDAF and laser autofocus makes a formidable duo, mediating those poorly dialed in images. How about the front? Well, the 6P gets a much appreciated 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor that’ll greet you every time your eyes meet the screen. There are no fancy add-ons on this 1.4 μm pixel lens, it’s just a bare-bones camera but you will be lucky enough to get HDR+ on the front too."

Malaysian  Apple  fans have been clamouring for the Apple Watch ever since it was announced, but here we are eight months later and still no Watch in sight. Well, we actually don’t know if this is good news or just slightly sad news because apparently Apple is already preparing a March 2016 event to unveil the second generation Apple Watch alongside what could be the 4-inch “iPhone 6c”. 9to5Mac reports that the second-generation wearable could possibly start shipping in April, a full year after the first device was launched. They also report that Apple had long developed the technology needed for future Apple Watch generations even before the original Apple Watch started shipping. Components that allow sleep tracking, wireless, health sensor technologies and even a new camera for the wearable have already been developed. When we  last saw the iPhone 6c , it was rumoured to be launched in the first half of 2016 and based on this new report, it looks like it should, at least, get a first half announcement alongside the 2nd gen Apple Watch. Following the success of the iPhone 5c, it doesn’t really come as a surprise that Apple wants to continue the c-badge because there are many Apple fans that simply cannot shell out the dough needed for their flagship devices. What’s even better is that the  iPhone 6c  could be powered by an Apple A8 ( iPhone 6 / 6 Plus )/A9 ( iPhone 6S / 6S Plus ) chip, so performance on iOS should be about as buttery as can be. If it follows in the footsteps of the iPhone 5c then it should come in a plastic body sporting a multitude of funky and bright colours. The smaller size would be a throwback to a time before iPhones became “iPhablets” which we’re sure will be welcomed by those with smaller hands. However, with the current abysmal exchange rate of the Ringgit, if this device is launched, would it be affordable enough to appeal to those below the high-end market? Based on the iPhone 5c’s  launch prices , RM1,999 for the 16GB model and RM2,399 for the 32GB model (keep in mind both of these are without GST), we doubt so. But then again, the iPhone low-to-midrange end isn’t exactly the same as other low-to-midrange brackets. [ SOURCE ]"
Arif Lee,Apple’s first ever battery pack is ugly and expensive,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/09/apple-now-has-a-smart-powerbank-for-the-iphone-6s/,"6s,apple,Apple Malaysia,Apple powerbank,Apple Smart Battery Case,iOS,iPhone,iPhone 6,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Smart Battery Case,iphone malaysia,iPhone Smart Battery Case,Malaysia,Powerbank,Smart Battery Case","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-09,"Form and function. These are synonymous with Apple. People may disagree with a lot of things but many will agree that when it comes to making something as ubiquitous as a smartphone look like a work of art, Apple does it best. But sometimes, even the best get it wrong. This is the Apple Smart Battery Case. It’s the company’s first ever battery pack and it’s decidedly un-Apple. More on that later but first, let’s go into the specs. The Smart Battery Case is a battery pack that fits the  iPhone 6  and  iPhone 6s . It packs a 1,877mAh battery and Apple says it’s good for 18 hours of internet browsing time on LTE or 20 hours of video playback time. The battery case has a soft touch silicone exterior with a microfibre inner lining to protect your iPhone. There are two colours to choose from (white and charcoal gray) currently and it’s the only battery case that comes with a lighting connector. So why is the Smart Battery Case un-Apple? It’s the design. Next to the slim, sleek and slender iPhone 6, the Smart Battery Case, with its unsightly bulge, looks like an afterthought, like the designers at Apple didn’t even bother to make this thing look good. It’s not that great as a battery case either. There’s no separate switch to activate or deactivate the battery case and the lack of an external battery indicator makes it difficult to know how much power you have left without turning on your iPhone. You do however get an integrated battery status built into iOS when the battery case is plugged into your iPhone but that means you will have to turn on your phone every time you want check the power status of the battery case. And for the  RM469  asking price, you’re not getting a lot. A popular battery case alternative like the  Mophie Juice Pack Air  with a 2,750mAh battery pack, a dedicated on/off switch and external LED indicators costs about the same. So if you’re an iPhone 6 or 6S user that’s constantly looking for a power point because your iPhone is out of battery, you might want to stay away from the Apple Battery Pack. It’s ugly, it’s expensive and for something that’s designed for the iPhone by the makers of the iPhone itself, it’s decidedly un-Apple. Maybe Apple took some inspiration from the device below.

Telekom Malaysia  has announced its collaboration with  iflix  to allow all TM UniFi subscribers to stream content from the local streaming service free of charge for a total of 12 months, which is worth RM96. While this is good news for UniFi subscribers, this collaboration seems to directly impede the growth of TM’s own, HyppTV’s video on demand (VOD) offers, though TM markets this iflix free subscription as an add-on to the existing IPTV service. What’s peculiar is that this iflix subscription service doesn’t require a login account. Starting mid-December of this year, UniFi subscribers only need to launch iflix on their preferred device while connected to their UniFi connection and the streaming service will “tag” the device, allowing users access to all its content. iflix will allow you to pair up to 5 devices per connection and will support concurrent streaming on up to 2 devices. If you want to register a sixth device, simply remove a previously registered device in iflix’s settings and register the new one. This is is pretty timely especially since iflix now also supports  offline viewing  on both iOS and Android devices. Before all you Streamyx subscribers start protesting, TM has also announced that they are working to bring these same benefits to their 4Mbps and 8Mbps Streamyx subscribers at a later date. Unfortunately, this service is not available for UniFi BIZ Advance Plan subscribers. This collaboration between TM and iflix is the first of its kind in the ASEAN region and is supposed to be part of fulfilling TM’s motto “Life Made Easier”."

After a false alarm over its  purported price , it looks like we’ve finally gotten a final answer thanks to Lazada Malaysia.  Available in either Graphite and Aluminium options, the Nexus 6P is listed with a RM2,689 price tag, and it comes equipped with 64GB of on-board storage. On top of that, Lazada is making the Nexus 6P deal sweeter by including a  Google Chromecast  worth RM170 for free. In case you didn’t know, the Google Chromecast is a  nifty little gadget  that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port. You can use it to push your mobile content to a bigger screen, and that includes videos and TV shows from  iflix .  To recap, the Nexus 6P is a more upmarket Nexus device with 5.7″ Quad HD screen wrapped under a full metal unibody chassis. Powering the pure Android experience device is a 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and it gets 64GB of storage which isn’t expandable. You get a 12.3MP f/2.0 main camera with Laser AutoFocus while the front gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter. For the first time on a Nexus, the Nexus 6P gets a fingerprint sensor which unlocks on a single touch and it uses the new USB Type-C standard that’s reversible. Keeping this flagship device running for long is a generous 3,450mAh capacity battery which is charged with a 3Amp Fast Charger.  At RM2,689, it is very closely priced with other Android flagship contenders including the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 Dual and Huawei Mate S. Of course, getting the Nexus 6P isn’t just about the hardware. It runs on the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow in its purest form, the way Android is intended to be experienced. Another plus point is that it will always be among the first devices to receive the latest Android updates.  The Nexus 6P will be launched next Tuesday, 8th December. Sales on Lazada hasn’t started yet and it is likely to be available for purchase after the event. Keep it locked on to SoyaCincau.com for the latest Nexus 6P stories. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The Lumia 950 that comes with a 5.2″ display is priced at RM2,700, which is close to what  we’ve seen earlier . The  pre-order page  mentions that it will be fulfilled by a Microsoft Authorised Seller, which is the same party that handled the  Microsoft Surface Pro 4  pre-order. Stock availability wise, Lazada is listing 18th December as its estimated time of arrival.  If you’re looking for something bigger, the phablet sized Lumia 950 XL has  appeared  as well with a retail price of RM3,000.

Both Lumia 950 and 950 XL are running on the latest Windows 10 for Mobile. To complete the full experience, the Microsoft Display Dock allows you to turn your smartphone into a desktop-like PC.

Well, we thought so too. This magical ad triggers a pop up in search results and allows users to stream the application (for now it’s only for games) for up to 60 seconds. The purpose is to allow users to try out the application before deciding whether or not they want to download it. According to Google, one in four applications downloaded is never even used because of the shortening mobile attention span of the average user. Trial Run Ads attempts to curb that by letting users really get a feel of an application before downloading them, thus benefiting both the user and the app developer. This application is only in its beta stage though, but Google has unveiled this to app developers so the ball is in their court now and it is up to them to decide how to best utilise this feature. With proper and effective implementation, this looks like it could be a very interesting feature. Besides this nifty app Harry Potter-y, Google is also starting the beta for Interactive Interstitial ads that utilises HTML5 to create interactive mobile advertisements. It will let advertisers completely customise the advertisement to their liking and give them the freedom they need to use HTML5 instead of standard templates and pull data dynamically. It is truly customisable and can allow advertisers to include the app’s value proposition and functionalities to suit advertisers who are looking for higher user engagement. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

Announced just in time for the mega Single’s Day sale in China, the  Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro  is bringing its audio experience up a notch while maintaining a low price tag.  The V3 Piston priced at RM69 were much improved over its former V2.1 Pistons with an ergonomically designed earpiece for greater comfort. The new Pro version carries this over and it boasts better sound with its hybrid driver set up consisting of a dynamic unit and a two-way balanced armature driver. On the exterior, it gets a polished metal back and it uses a durable Kevlar fiber cable that’s wrapped in a braided sleeve.  For smartphone use, there’s a 3-button controller with a built-in mic attached to the right side cable. Despite its more upmarket audio credentials, the packaging for the Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro is rather basic compared to its former Piston V2.1/V3.0 series. There’s no nice hard plastic case or a rubber cable organiser. For RM79, we can’t really complain and it has a stronger bass than the previous Pistons.  If you want something better than your stock bundled headphones, this pair is definitely worth paying for.

Alexander Wong,Guess which brand is number 1 for wearables?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/05/idc-smart-wearables-smart-watch-q3-2015-report/,,,2015-12-05,"The  Apple Watch  has definitely shaken the smart watch scene this year. While it isn’t the  game changer  we’re looking for, the expensive price tag didn’t seem to stop it from becoming a hot seller.   According to the latest IDC report, Apple has already sold 7.5 million Watches between April and October. You can’t deny that’s pretty impressive considering Samsung only sold  over a million Gear smart watches  for the whole of 2014. Even Android Wear has managed to ship  720,000 units , with Moto 360 leading the pack. Despite the impressive figures for Apple, they are still not number 1 when it comes to wearable devices.    Holding on to its  #1 spot  is  Fitbit  with its line of dedicated fitness trackers. In the face of heighten competition from its affordable Chinese rivals, they are continuing to grow from 3.9 million units shipped in Q1 this year to 4.7 million shipped in the last quarter. Driving the sales is their popular Charge and Surge, as they continue to increase its presence worldwide. According to IDC, the increase for Fitbit was also attributed to the rise of corporate wellness programs with large corporations providing Fitbit trackers for their staff.  With the entry of Apple Watch, the Cupertino company has managed to catapult itself to 2nd place, putting a dent to the market share of current wearable brands. In Q3, Apple has shipped 3.9 Watches, an increase of 300,000 over Q2 as it increased its availability to more market. Strangely Malaysians are still not getting the Watch, while it is already on sale officially in Singapore, Thailand and most recently  Indonesia  starting yesterday. At number 3 for Q3 2015 is Xiaomi with its super affordable Mi Band. So far they have shipped out 9.6 million units for 2015 and they are expected to close the year higher after its recent Single’s Day sale. To revive its popularity, the Chinese company had also announced an upgraded  Mi Band 1S  that comes with a heart rate sensor while maintaining a low 99 CNY (about RM68) price tag.  Meanwhile, Garmin is still persistent in 4th place with 900,000 wearables shipped, but the real shocker is Samsung as it gets knocked off the Top 5 list for the first time this year. The new entry is a  YTC Y01  children watch by BBK with 700,000 sold last quarter. The Chinese based company had sold 100,000 more than Samsung, thus pushing them down to 6th place. With the introduction of its  Gear S2 , Samsung might just bounce back especially with the current year-end shopping season. In terms of looks, we’d say Samsung has finally nailed it with  the Gear S2 , but they had cut down the number of features compared to its earlier Gear models.    [  SOURCE   2  ]"

What are we talking about? Well, the folks at  OnePlus  have decided it was a good idea to poke the metaphorical bear that is Apple, with their latest advert for an  iPhone 6 / 6s  Sandstone back case. Mmm, we love the smell of napalm in the morning. In their cheeky video – which looks like a parody of what we like to call the “swelling-music-advert” – OnePlus have painted themselves (or their users at least) as  that guy  who has got it “covered”, always ready and willing to help out their friends in need. In this case (ha ha), it would be OnePlus’ new friends over at Cupertino. As fun as this is, we certainly do hope OnePlus doesn’t think ALL its users dress like the guy in the video (that hat, really?). Just yesterday, OnePlus also posted a teaser on their Facebook page about their latest product, which I’m sure must’ve irked many an iPhone user now that the cat’s out of the bag. There is yet more evidence of this “friendly ribbing” on their product page as they strive to give iPhone 6/6s users the “Never Settle” feel, adding that its “sturdy, polycarbonate construction” adds both “grippiness and protection”. Apparently it’s one of those things “you won’t understand until you try it”. To sweeten the deal, OnePlus is throwing in a physical  OnePlus X  invite with every purchase of this back case. That’s not all, the invites aren’t only invitations to buy the regular phone, but there is also a chance that you could get an invite to purchase the OnePlus X Ceramic or better yet, a free device. Now that sounds dandy and all but when we tried to purchase the case from their online store, a pop-up informed us that the case was currently out of stock, despite it being listed as in stock on the page itself. Maybe this is some kind of elaborate April fools prank in December. December Dummies perhaps? Of course, this isn’t the first time OnePlus has done something most people deem ridiculous to generate buzz, just a few months back their  co-founder applied to be an intern at Samsung . If you’re interested in the case, head on over to their  product page  or  website  to check it out for yourselves. See? We’ve got you covered too. [ SOURCE ]"

This is the BlackBerry’s first flagship to run on Android and it comes with its BlackBerry Torch-like slider keyboard. Available in retail stores and telcos from 12th December, the PRIV is priced at S$1,098 which converts to RM3,296. That’s slightly more than the Galaxy Note5 which was launched in the island state at S$1,088. Catching up since the BlackBerry Passport, the PRIV aims to stay relevant with updated hardware and a fresh user experience. It gets a 5.4″ AMOLED Quad HD screen with double curved edges and it runs on a more current Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage it has 32GB on-board which is expandable with microSD.  Running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the possibility of being upgraded to Marshmallow early next year, the PRIV eliminates the concern of having limited apps with full access to the Google Play Store. With virtually all Android players adopting a full touch screen display, BlackBerry hopes to fulfill the needs of consumers that desire the tactile feel of a physical keyboard.  Given its retail price, the PRIV will face a tough challenge from likes of the Galaxy Note5, Xperia Z5 and even the Nexus 6P. After all, existing Android users will be their key focus group  according  to their Senior Director for Asia Pacific Product Management. The main deciding factor of course the slider keyboard. With the advancements of virtual keyboards such as SwiftKey and Swype, do you really need a physical keyboard in this day and age?  Given a choice between a BlackBerry PRIV and a Galaxy Note5, which smartphone would you get? The PRIV has passed our local  SIRIM certification  a while back and it shouldn’t take too long for BlackBerry to launch it in Malaysia.  [  SOURCE   2  ]"

By making his own smartphone. An engineer by occupation, Andy Rubin has been around; he’s graced Car Zeiss, Apple, MSN, Google and of course, Android Inc. Interestingly, a report from The Information has the long lost granddaddy of all things Android calling for a recruitment drive for individuals to join his revisited escapade. A year plus after taking his leave from  Google , it’s apparent that his brainchild Playground Global will finally start giving back to his own causes. The aforementioned start-up by Rubin serves as a tech hatchery of sorts; enabling those wanting to start their own thing but don’t have the resources, mentorship and funding to make it happen. The Fund itself, managed to raise roughly US$ 300 million from investments by Google (no duh), Hewlett-Packard aka HP, Seagate and others. Leveraging on his venture capital experiences with Redpoint Ventures (where he is a partner), as for now, his cash flow has been streaming to artificial intelligence and smart home segments. Though the aforementioned report states that Rubin still sees the opportunity to enter the Android smartphone market. Folks at the Verge seems to think that the dynamics of the low to midrange market is too volatile to enter, with manufactures popping up every now and then. Thus, maybe his best bet is to make a premium device that’ll hope to take a slice away from the Apple pie. The inhibitors of Mountain View might have something to say about that, since Google themselves have been reported to be working on their own hardware; all the pieces seem to be lining up quite well for the former head of Android Inc. And a possible return to the smartphone scene might amount to a foreseeable re-entry at Google. Jumping at any opportunity to make something great, Rubin has touched the lives of many, even if we fail to realise it. As the master of surprises and all things Android, should we expect anything less from him? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Alexander Wong,Microsoft is throwing a Lumia 950 launch party and here’s how you can get an invite,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/microsoft-lumia-950-950-xl-malaysia-launch-party/,"Lumia,Microsoft Lumia 950,Microsoft Lumia 950 Malaysia,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL Malaysia,Windows 10,Windows 10 Mobile,windows phone","Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2015-12-02,"Offering the best of Windows 10 in a mobile form factor, the flagship  Lumia 950  and  Lumia 950 XL  are finally making an appearance in Malaysia. The folks at Microsoft Malaysia are throwing a launch party on the 15th of December and you can stand a chance to win passes to the event.  There are 20 pairs of passes up for grabs and all you’ll need to do is to tell them why you love the Lumia 950 by completing the following sentence: “I love the Lumia 950 and 950 XL as much as…”. You can try your luck over at their  Facebook post  and as usual, don’t forget to read the  T&Cs . To refresh your memory, the new Lumia 950/950 XL are Microsoft’s newest high-end smart phones since the launch of the  Nokia Lumia 930 . Announced back in  October , these two smart phones are designed to deliver an integrated experince with its Windows 10 family of products. Apart from having the latest OS, both the Lumia 950 and 950 XL offers a high resolution Quad HD display in 5.2″ and 5.7″ screen sizes respectively. Under the hood, the larger Lumia 950 XL runs on a 2GHz Snapdragon 810 processor while the compact Lumia 950 gets a respectable 1.8GHz Snapdragon 808 unit. Both models come equipped with 3GB of RAM and has 32GB of storage as standard. If that’s not enough, you can easily pop-in a microSD card up to 2TB.  Photography should be one of its killer features with a 20MP f/1.9 PureView camera that’s assisted with triple-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. It shoots videos in 4K with audio being captured by a 4 microphone set up. For selfies, both models get a 5MP f/2.4 wide angle camera upfront that supports Full HD video recording. Keeping up with times, Microsoft is putting a USB Type-C port on both models and it supports Qi Wireless Charging and Fast Charge. The Lumia 950 gets a 3,000mAh battery while the bigger sibling gets a larger 3,340mAh capacity unit. In the connectivity department, it ticks all the essential boxes including 4G LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac WiFi. While it may not have a fingerprint scanner like its high-end rivals, the new flagship Lumias support Windows Hello biometric authentication feature, which unlocks at a glance. The biggest feature to look forward to is Windows Continuum. With an optional  Display Dock , the Lumia 950/950 XL can be turned into a full PC experience. Just hook up a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and you can check emails and work on MS Office documents like you do on a desktop.  We don’t have local pricing details yet but the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL are priced in the US at US$549 (RM2,319) and US$649 (RM2,742) respectively. From what we’ve seen from  SIRIM , we should be getting dual-SIM variants for both models.   [  SOURCE  ]"

This do or die device will be the brand’s pivotal move to see if it can still play the mobile game or close down for good. The QWERTY physical keyboard returns, this time on the brand that has (tried) kept it alive. This symbiotic relationship is close to becoming an old script, with users preferring the regularly used touch-based screens. They’re final market place would be business users that deal with highly classified information: trade secrets, medical related and anything else that falls under the same sun. At one point, even the Secret Service’s most important asset aka President Barack Obama, once used a BlackBerry smartphone. So what’s so appealing about their soon to be released device? Well for one it’ll boast a 5.4-inch AMOLED display that is capable of QHD (2144 x 1980) resolution. The glass on the device features a tapering dual edged screen, that doubles as a battery level indicator when plugged in (on one side). Multitasking shouldn’t be a hitch on the smartphone that carries 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage. Camera-wise, there are two lenses, as expected: an Schneider-Kreuznach 18-megapixel rear shutter with OIS and dual LEDs, while the front gets a lowly 2-megapixel lens. Other than the usual suspects, the PRIV will also have a slew of connectivity options as listed below: Packing a punch, the PRIV hides a 3,410 mAh battery underneath its lower half, as Android 5.1.1 Lollipop will work as its brains. Uniquely to the PRIV, their manufacturer has outed some of its apps on the Google Play Store, adding a little signature touch to the whole experience. Those thinking of picking up the PRIV should take a  look  at how it handles durability, since it has the security aspect on lock down. Users will have to wait for the device to launch first before knowing the pricing but look for it to be roughly RM 2,966 (converted from US pricing) and our neighbours in Singapore have to fork out S$ 1,098 which converts to RM 3,296.

Alexander Wong,BlackBerry PRIV: Can an Android smartphone with a physical keyboard save the day?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/03/blackberry-priv-first-impressions-malaysia/,"Android,blackberry,BlackBerry Android Smart Phone,BlackBerry PRIV,Blackberry PRIV First impressions,Blackberry PRIV Hands-on,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia,BlackBerry PRIV Malaysia Launch,first impressions","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-03,"A BlackBerry running Android? Several years ago, the idea would be laughable, but today an Android smartphone could actually make or break this once dominate mobile brand. As BlackBerry continues to lose ground in smartphone  market , they are pinning  their  hopes on the  BlackBerry PRIV . Their first Android device that comes with a slider keyboard.  The PRIV will be launched in Malaysia  next week  and we’re lucky enough to get a brief hands-on with this new slider device.  At 5.4 inches, the PRIV is the largest smartphone BlackBerry has ever produced and the display features a double curve screen that’s very much like the S6 edge. Though the phone is not wrapped in metal, it does look premium enough for the business-centric user. The back has a grippy texture to it which gives it an assuring feel in the hands, but it took a little while to get used to. When held in the hands, it does have a nice heft to it and despite having a larger screen plus a sliding keyboard mechanism, it is lighter by a couple of grams than the  BlackBerry Passport .  The sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main highlight of the PRIV, and the mechanism and the design are much improved from the old BlackBerry Torch. When sliding out, the PRIV feels slightly top heavy but it didn’t really bother us while typing. Having used a BlackBerry Bold previously, I found the keyboard to be enjoyable to use. Yes, you do type faster with on-screen keyboards with advance prediction technology but it doesn’t give the same tactile satisfaction as the real deal. Another advantage of using a slider keyboard is that you’ll have an unobstructed display to view your stuff since there’s no on-screen keyboard occupying half of the screen. Like the BlackBerry Passport, the keyboard has a couple of neat tricks. It also functions as a touchpad for scrolling and it makes text selection quicker and accurate.  There’s also a text prediction feature that was introduced on BlackBerry 10 and it lets you flick predicted words upwards without having to move your thumbs away from the keyboard. In terms of single-handed use, the width of the device is just right and you won’t struggle as much as the BlackBerry Passport that’s super wide.  If you’re not using a physical keyboard, the stock BlackBerry keyboard works just fine and you probably could install 3rd party ones like Swype or SwiftKey. I can imagine myself using the virtual keyboard more frequently for quick social updates, replies or while hooked up to a holder while driving.  In terms of performance, the PRIV that runs on Android 5.1.1 felt quite smooth and I didn’t experience any noticeable lags in the short time using it. The UI is very stock like and they do integrated a couple of native BlackBerry Apps including the unified BlackBerry Hub. If you’re using an Android device currently, you should feel quite at home but BB10 users might take a while to get used to it as  demonstrated  by their CEO John Chen. So is the BlackBerry PRIV the device to get? Probably the one and the only reason to consider is its physical keyboard. I love the feel of it, I really do and it is something that I find myself using regularly for writing stories or replying emails. But for other things when you just need to shoot a quick reply, the on-screen keyboard does the job just fine.  Knowing BlackBerry will definitely  price this  at a premium, we struggle to justify why anyone should get it over the Galaxy Note5. In terms of hardware, the Quad HD display, Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is pretty much mainstream. You could get that on the LG G4 that’s currently going for about RM2,299.  Of course, specs is just one factor to consider and the PRIV is also focused on privacy, which they are claiming to be the most if not one of the most secure Android smartphones in the market. Admittedly, I didn’t manage to explore other features such as the 18MP OIS-equipped camera and the DTEK security monitoring tool. Hopefully, we get to do so during the official local launch that’s happening on 8th December. Unless you’re getting this as a company phone, it is quite hard to justify paying more just the keyboard alone. Is there a genuine need for a physical QWERTY keyboard? Several Android brands have tried with the  HTC Desire Z ,  HTC ChaCha  and the  Motorola Milestone , but most of them have ceased to exist. The recent attempt is by Samsung with its  Keyboard Cover accessory  for the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+, but with a less ideal implementation.  Could BlackBerry stay relevant in the Android world with the PRIV? Let us know in the comments below."

We love them because they do what we don’t ever, ever, ever, ever want to do ourselves. We also love them because it’s fun to watch an extremely premium device get smashed to bits in the most ridiculous fashion ever. If you share our sentiment then good news! UnboxTherapy just dropped a new video where he uses the Samsung Galaxy S6 active (which we know is one tough device) as a hockey puck. If you can’t tell, our noses are wrinkled with excitement now. In case you don’t already know, the  Samsung Galaxy S6 active  sports a 5.1″ quad-HD Super AMOLED display (1440×2560 pixels). On the inside, the device is powered by an Exynos 7420 octa-core processor with four cores clocked at 2.1GHz and four at 1.5GHz paired with a 3GB of RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The camera unit is a 16-megapixel/5-megapixel front/rear combo and the entire device is wrapped up in a super-rugged shell. Designed to be a super rugged version of the Galaxy S6, the device is IP68 dust and water-resistant up to 1.5 metres and 30 minutes. It’s also MIL-STD-810G certified salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport, and thermal shock resistant. Yup, that means it has a military certification for being able to take a beating. All credit to the device, it really  can  take a beating. Unfortunately, the Galaxy S6 active isn’t available in Malaysia in case you were thinking of getting one to have a go at it on Sunway’s ice rink. That said, we would really like it if Samsung Malaysia brings one over for us to have a spot if sepak takraw with. Pretty please? [ SOURCE ]"
Rory Lee,"Samsung Galaxy A line unveiled, premium for the masses v2.0",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/03/samsung-galaxy-a-line-unveiled-premium-for-the-masses-v2-0/,"Android,budget smartphone,Samsung,samsung budget smartphone,Samsung Galaxy A,Samsung Galaxy A revealed,Samsung Galaxy A3,Samsung Galaxy A3 revealed,Samsung Galaxy A5,Samsung Galaxy A5 revealed,Samsung Galaxy A7,Samsung Galaxy A7 revealed,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-12-03,"After numerous  rumours  and  leaks , the  Samsung Galaxy A  series has finally been revealed. If they keep the pricing in the same bracket as the previous Galaxy A series, we could have a serious contender in the low-to-midrange end of the smartphone market. The Galaxy A series consists of three phones, the  Galaxy A3 ,  Galaxy A5 , and  Galaxy A7  all bearing their new “6” badge that is supposed to represent 2016. We don’t know about you, but this peculiar badging just seems like another way to unnecessarily confuse prospective buyers. At first glance, all three devices share  Samsung ’s  Galaxy S6  flagship’s looks with a metal body sandwiched between two panels of glass. They also feature the rounded edges of the Galaxy S6 and pretty much the same layout we’ve grown to get used to for Samsung devices. All three devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. One thing that we were quite impressed with was the camera. All devices across the announced Galaxy A range feature a 13-megapixel f/1.9 aperture rear shooter and a 5-megapixel f/1.9 selfie camera. What separates them is that on the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 both come bundled with optical image stabilisation (OIS) for their primary imaging unit. That’s pretty impressive for what looks to be mid-range devices. The best part? They all come in Pink Gold, so if you’ve ever wanted that colour but not the price tag it usually comes with, this could be your chance. That aside, the Galaxy A series begins with what looks like the entry-level Galaxy A3 sporting a 4.7-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) Super AMOLED display. The device would be powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor mated with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 128GB via microSD. This smartphone will also come with a 2,300 mAh battery. The Galaxy A3 will also have dual-SIM support, but it doesn’t appear to be a hybrid-SIM set up which means that you can have two SIMs and a microSD card. Other goodies include Cat.4 LTE connectivity support and 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It also comes with Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, but no support for Samsung Pay. Moving up the pecking order comes the mid-range Galaxy A5. As the name implies, the Galaxy A5 is a step up from the Galaxy A3 and features a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (also expandable via microSD up to 128GB). It is also bigger, with a 5.2” full-HD (1920×1080 pixels) Super AMOLED display. Powering it all will be a 2,900 mAh battery with fast charging. Connectivity options include Cat.6 LTE support, 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 2.0 and NFC, this time with support for Samsung Pay. Perhaps one of the key features of this device is the fingerprint scanner, which is quite rare beyond the top end of the smartphone spectrum. Much like the Galaxy A3, the Galaxy A5 also has dual-SIM support. Sitting at the top of the range is the Galaxy A7, which is the largest device, featuring a 5.5-inch full-HD Super AMOLED panel. Under the hood, the smartphone will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB. It also has dual-SIM capabilities. Connectivity options are the same as the Galaxy A5, but the Galaxy A7 gets a bigger 3,300 mAh battery also with fast charging. Like its smaller brother the Galaxy A5, the Galaxy A7 also comes with a fingerprint scanner and support for Samsung Pay. Though the specific type of processor was not revealed, we have a hunch that it is Samsung’s Exynos processor. The first range of the Galaxy A smartphones were launched towards the end of 2014 and it was Samsung’s first attempt at truly bringing premium build quality to the masses. Before the Galaxy A series was launched, Samsung’s low end devices were all very plasticky and felt cheaply made, which felt like a rude reminder to all those who bought them to work harder. Now, with the rise of Chinese OEMs and their seemingly impossible smartphone value-for-money, especially in the lower end of the spectrum, the Korean electronics giant can’t afford to be complacent in their budget smartphones and risk giving up this lucrative section in the market. If the refreshed 2016 versions of the Galaxy A lineup are to be priced similarly to the previous Galaxy A lineup, we think that it could definitely be very competitive in that market. However, if Samsung prices these devices higher than their previous lineup, you’d be better off with a discounted Galaxy S6 instead. As a reference, when the original Galaxy A lineup was launched, the Galaxy A3 was priced at RM899, while the Galaxy A5 was priced at RM1,199, and the Galaxy A7 would set you back RM1,499. Bear in mind, these prices were before the implementation of GST and the falling ringgit. Of course, there are other good smartphones at this price bracket as well, such as the  OnePlus X , the  Sony Xperia M5 Dual  and the  honor 7 . So the question is, do you buy into Samsung’s idea of a premium mid-range device? We’re pretty keen on these devices, what do you guys think? Let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

Well, they certainly weren’t kidding when they said it was designed specifically for the 4G LTE user. Hotlink FAST’s starter pack is priced at RM15 and it comes with RM5 preloaded airtime, 300MB preloaded high-speed Internet and offers users a choice of three internet passes. The first plan gives users a 2GB quota for 30 days, then the second plan doubles that up to 4GB and finally the third plan is sort of a “lite” version where it gives users 500MB for 7 days. Call rates are the same across all plans at 6sen/30sec to your ACTIV10 (10 Hotlink/Maxis numbers) and 12sen/30sec to all local networks. SMS is rated at 1sen/SMS to your ACTIV10 contacts and 12sen/SMS to all local networks. Users can also apply for an add-on of either 1GB (RM12), 500MB (RM8), or 300MB (RM5) that will last the duration of your quota cycle. On the website, it states that there will be “No credit drain” and that the “Internet will stop its service once the FAST Internet pass expires.” However, Hotlink informs us that one the quota has been finished, you can still surf the Internet, but at a throttled speed of 64kbps. They explained that although the quota was split between 4G LTE and non-4G LTE speeds, once a user depletes their designated 4G quota, they can continue surfing at 4G speeds but this time it will draw from their “All Networks” quota instead. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true. This means that if you were in a location without 4G LTE coverage, you can only use the “All Networks” quota, which is half of what you are actually paying for. Now we understand that to create a “competitive” plan, compromises have to be made, but surely this doesn’t make any sense. Why would Hotlink want to segregate quota by network type? This just seems like a major inconvenience to the consumer. Perhaps this is a testament to  how confident Maxis is in their 4G LTE coverage , but even that seems like a stretch to try and justify their actions. In any case the plans themselves, if you ignore the split quota, is quite reasonable. So, if you have faith in Maxis’ network coverage and would like to sign up for this plan, existing Hotlink users can do so via the Hotlink RED app by going to ‘My Account’ and selecting ‘Change’ next to ‘Rateplan’. Alternatively they can dial *100*6*1# from their mobile devices. Non-Hotlink members can simply proceed to the nearest Hotlink Dealer or Maxis Centre. For more information, head on over to their  website ."

Captivating tech folks since coming into existence, the USB Type-C port is almost an all-in-one cable/head solution – beam pixels your display, transfer your data and charge up your power-hungry devices. So how does Thunderbolt 3 come into play? Well, utilisation of USB Type-C protocols and Thunderbolt 3 technology will in theory allow data transfers up to 40Gbps (giga bits per second), doubling what we’ve seen on Thunderbolt 2 ports, and quadrupling speeds on USB 3.1. That roughly translates to an uncompressed RAW 4K video (1 hour long) sizing in at 158.2GB transferring around 30 seconds – working out to 5GBps. Talking about driving pixels on screen, it’ll also be capable of displaying two 4K-resolution screens up to a 60Hz refresh rate at the same time and quicken charging for notebooks up to 100 watts. Setting a platform for other types of protocols like DisplayPort, Super Speed USB and PCIExpress, Intel will bank on Thunderbolt to gain traction, as it hasn’t really caught on for most users; except those tech-centric folks out there needing more from their ports. Already realised on smartphones like the OnePlus Two (but don’t use their cables, read about that here), Xiaomi’s Mi 4c, Lumia 950 series, latest Nexuses, PCs and tablets, we hope that USB Type-C catches on quickly.

DirectD is a household name in our country and despite setting abhorrent prices on some of their inventory. Xiaomi ’s second iteration of a tablet, the  Mi Pad 2 , meets the list and now has an all metal body – easily comparable to the iPad Mini 4. The model that’s available on DirectD’s website is the 16GB version, and they’ve priced it RM 899 (w/ GST). The colours on offer are Champagne gold and Dark grey. Jogging your memory on this tablet, it has a 7.9-inch screen plastered onto its metal build, the screen itself has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (326 ppi). Lighter, thinner and overall smaller than its predecessor, it maintains the same screen size but shrinks down the bezels all around the screen. The Mi Pad 2, ditches the plastic yet weighs in at 322grams, when the model it replaces tips in at 360grams. The upgrades continue with an Intel chipset now at the helm, a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 to be precise. Its 16GB internal storage might set off some alarms with the omission of a microSD slot, especially those inclined to have most of their media with them on the go. For photography (if you’re seriously going to consider that with a tablet), it’ll get an 8-megapixel f/2.0 aperture lens on the rear, that will get you up to FHD video recording. As the front has a 5-megapixel lens, in case of those video calling moments or selfies (again, if you’re seriously considering doing that with a tablet). Two speaker grills will be found on the bottom rear and underneath its backing, there’s a 6190 mAh battery, smaller than before. Xiaomi however, promises it’ll get you 100 hours of music listening and almost 12 and a half hours of video watching. Charging the aforementioned battery will be the USB Type-C port and connector, while other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; sadly, no 4G LTE support makes its way on this device. In terms of software, you’ll find MIUI 7 OS skin, as per usual. Xiaomi has plans on releasing a Windows 10 model soon, but we have no idea when it’ll be announced. Comparing prices abroad in the brand’s domestic market (China), the 16GB sells for roughly RM 662, that’s a RM 200+ premium, that you’re paying for. At the same time, the higher 64GB model retails for about RM 861, so think about that for a second. You pay for what you get it seems and DirectD has the ball in their court, whether or not it’ll be received well, that depends on you guys. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  IMAGE SOURCE  ]"

Rory Lee,The 3x optical zoom ASUS ZenFone Zoom is now on sale in Taiwan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/02/the-3x-optical-zoom-asus-zenfone-zoom-on-sale-in-taiwan/,"Android,Asus,ASUS Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone,ASUS ZenFone Zoom,asus zenfone zoom launch,camera,lumia 1020,Optical Zoom,smart phone,smart phone camera,smartphone,smartphone camera,smartphone with optical zoom,ZenFone Zoom,zenfone zoom launch,zenfone zoom launch taiwan,zoom lens","Android,Asus,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-12-02,"According to a report published in 2013, over  90% of people who have ever taken a photo in their life  have only done so on a phone, not a traditional or standalone camera. That is a staggering number of people if you think about it, especially taking into consideration the keyword in that phrase is ‘ever’. Which means that, even two years ago, when smartphone cameras were arguably worse than they are now, people still defaulted to them for that snapshotting needs. This is completely understandable simply because a smartphone is more portable, usually cheaper and are just generally more convenient. Well,  ASUS  hopes to add to that statistic with their latest  ZenFone Zoom , which officially goes on sale in Taiwan today. One of the biggest problems was that most smartphones relied on a digital zoom, which is more like a fancy way to crop your photos if you think about it. The one you want to go for when zooming is the optical zoom, which adjusts the glass positioned in a camera/lens unit to reposition the light hitting the sensor, which brings the image closer but maintains its quality. Most smartphones shy away from using this because having multiple pieces of glass in the camera unit means having more space which in turn translates to a bigger camera hump. The supposedly brilliant thing about the ZenFone Zoom though is that it is the “world’s thinnest 3x-optical zoom smartphone”. How thin is thin? Well ASUS states that the ZenFone Zoom only has a 5mm edge. Bear in mind, this is the edge, and as the ZenFone line of devices have usually been curved at the back, this looks to be no exception. From the looks of it, the device’s camera unit does take up an enormous amount of space on the back panel ala- Lumia 1020 , but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the Lumia. In a device that is designed to take photographs, most of the actual photography will be taken by the primary 13-megapixel rear shooter while selfies and video chats will be handled by the device’s 5MP front facing unit. Other primary camera goodies include a dual-LED flash, laser autofocus, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and ASUS’ PixelMaster 2.0 camera technology that is designed to greatly improve low light photography, granting up to a 400% increase in brightness. For those curious about the PixelMaster 2.0 technology, we’ve already put it through its paces in our  Zenfone 2 Laser review . The ZenFone Zoom will also feature a dedicated shutter button, record button as well as a zoom rocker. Then again, we already expected most of this as the device was announced almost a year ago. What we do know now for sure now is that the device will come in 64GB and 128GB variants. Internal specs include an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz for the 64GB variant while the 128GB variant will be powered by a 2.5GHz Intel Atom Z3590 quad-core processor. Based on the website, it appears that the device will also come with 4GB of RAM and be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery with ASUS’ BoostMaster quick charging technology. The devices will also come running Android Lollipop out of the box. Display wise, the smartphone will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display with a pixel density of 403 ppi tucked away under the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The body will also be of an aluminium unibody construction with what looks like a faux leather back to help with grip and texture as well as a ridge at the bottom of the phone to help with one handed photography. But we all know what a unibody means: no removable battery. It does have what looks like a lanyard port and appears to come bundled with a camera strap. The 64GB device retails in Taiwan for TWD13,990 (around RM1,806) while the 128GB will go for TWD15,990 (around RM2,065). While ASUS did not announce when this device will be available in other markets,  ASUS Malaysia  has hinted at an  end-of-2015 release , which means it could be any time now. The odd thing is that this device was announced a long time ago, and between its announcement and today ASUS has launched several devices already. This begs the question, what took them so long? Was there a massive kink in the device that delayed its launch this long? Let’s hope they’ve worked out whatever problems they had with it (if they had any problems) lest we have a repeat of  LG’s little disaster . We suspect this device will appeal to some camera enthusiasts who were interested in the Lumia 1020 but not the Windows Mobile platform. While it does seem that this device is a worthy Android equivalent, its sensor is but a measly 13-megapixels versus the Lumia 1020’s 41-megapixel monstrosity. Then again, megapixel isn’t the be-all and end-all of camera quality, so we will just have to wait and see. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ]"
Arif Lee,Vivo releases metal duos with huge RAM: The X6 and X6 Plus,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/01/vivo-releases-metal-duos-with-huge-ram-the-x6-and-x6-plus/,"4G LTE,4GB RAM,AMOLED,Android,Announcement,China,Dual Sim,Funtouch,Funtouch OS,launch,Price,release,reveal,Vivo,vivo X6,vivo X6 Plus,X6,X6 Plus","Android,Industry in General,LTE,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,vivo",2015-12-01,"Chinese manufacturers have been busy of late, creating phones that easily rival known brands. Making inlays into the higher-end market by imploring classier materials like metal, as seen by Huawei and Xiaomi, Vivo hasn’t been left in the dust, releasing the X6 and X6 Plus in light of the current trend. Specs are king though the new duo might have something to say about that, taking a look under their hoods. Let’s start with the smaller X6, that carries a 5.2-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display. Under that screen, sits a 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6752 Octa-core processor, mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. It is made from anodised aluminium and going through 57 steps before getting laser engraved and well deserved polish. Other stock internals include the 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, while sitting under it, is a square cut out, where you’ll find the fingerprint scanner. The rear lenses on both devices will be equip with Phase Detection auto-focus, HDR and a f/2.2 aperture sensor. As a quick flip to the front will reveal the 8-megapixel shutter on the top of the screen. It’ll also natively support a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot, that allows you to swap up the second SIM for a microSD card. The two devices are quite similar, only altering by screen size, internal storage and battery size. That said, the larger X6 Plus has a 5.7-inch screen of the same resolution, while its internal memory gets bumped up to 64GBs. The smaller of the two will carry a 2,400 mAh battery and the vivo X6 Plus will don a 3,000 mAh battery. Vivo’s X6 has a footprint of 147.9 x 73.8 x 6.6mm, as its larger sibling doesn’t pay heed to its dimensions on vivo’s website. Both devices will fun Funtouch OS on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop and retail for the following prices: 2,600 RMB (RM 1,721) – vivo X6 and 3,200 RMB – vivo X6 Plus (RM 2,118). We’re not entirely convinced that people will pick up the device, considering other household names that sell their mid-range devices for roughly the same price. For now this Apple look-alike will only be exclusively sold in China beginning the 7 th  of December. Then again, all smartphones pretty much have some form of resemblances with one another – or maybe that’s just our opinion. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

According to the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), this update was not initiated by the app maker and has been infecting Android devices in Singapore over the past few months. After the “update” has been downloaded, the malware will prompt the user to enter confidential information, such as credit card details. Then the malware would take over the affected device and intercepts the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS to the phone for committing fraudulent transactions. “Criminals have been targeting computer users, but now criminals have turned to targeting Android phone users as banks are pushing out more banking apps for user convenience,” said ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. It turns out convenience really is becoming the downfall of humanity as we continuously rely on our devices to carry out daily activities. According to Channel NewsAsia, this vulnerability extends beyond just WhatsApp as they claim the malware is disguising itself as an operating system update as well. They reported that about 50 smartphone users have been hit by malware targeting mobile banking customers in the last three months. Besides disguising itself as a WhatsApp update, it also reportedly masquerades as an operating system update for the battery management module. Channel NewsAsia also reports that ABS estimates the average amounts lost by the victims who are customers of major retail banks in Singapore were “a couple of hundred of dollars”, although some victims could have lost several thousand dollars through multiple transactions. The source of these fraudulent transactions appear to originate from Eastern Europe and includes purchases of budget airline tickets. “Jailbroken iPhones or rooted Android [devices] are vulnerable…and in particular Android, because that phone system involves easier download of third-party apps,” said Ong-Ang. The silver lining is that ABS states that banks may refund victims on a case-by-case basis depending on whether or not the victim took the necessary precautions to protect themselves from such attacks. Singapore is awfully close to our home soil of Malaysia, so please be warned and double check your updates before installing them. At the time that this article was written, there has been no official announcement on this matter posted on WhatsApp’s Facebook page, Twitter or Blog. So the moral of the story here is, please make sure that your application updates come directly from the Google Play Store. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"
Rory Lee,"ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser Review: Good scope, bad shot",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/12/01/asus-zenfone-2-laser-review-good-scope-bad-shot/,,,2015-12-01,"In the world of television, spin-offs are a common sight as many networks try their hardest to keep that rare gem of a tv show alive. I completely understand this desire to milk every last drop out of your prized cow simply because money is hard to make in this world where piracy is rampant. Generally, many of these spin-offs tend to fall flat and the way I see it, there are two big reasons why this happens. The first is that the show doesn’t live up to the hype. It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of something as big as, say,  Friends  for example (we’re looking at you  Joey ). Secondly, it doesn’t eventually break off from the original and find and identity of its own, or that special niche that makes a show special. In the world of smartphones, it seems, that there exists this same desire to spin off into various other versions of an OEM’s flagship or popular device. Some spin-offs are designed to make their flagship devices more accessible with lower price points by omitting one or two key features but keeping the feel the same. Others try to incorporate one new key feature that’s absent from the main device. The latter is where  ASUS ’s  Zenfone 2 Laser  comes in. In case you haven’t realised it yet, the keyword here is “laser”, which means that this spin-off device’s camera comes with a laser autofocus. And as with spin-offs, the question remains, does it float or does it fall?"

As a gesture of appreciation to its subscribers, they are giving out  1GB of free data  for the month of December. So how fast is the fastest? Speedtest has finally revealed the numbers along with the rank of our current fixed and mobile operators in the country. Full details after the break.  Starting with mobile networks that are running on 4G LTE, U Mobile is ranked #1 with an average download speed of 22.58Mbps with uploads of 10.34Mbps. Following in 2nd place is Celcom with 19.46Mbps downloads and Maxis holding on to third place at 18.20Mbps. Meanwhile, Digi takes the last place at 17.49Mbps.   For fixed broadband, TM takes up the Top 3 which is a mixture of various identifiers that lead back to Telekom Malaysia. Looking at the speeds, it is safe to assume that all 3 listings are predominantly Unifi subscribers on the highest 20Mbps Unifi plan. This is then followed by Maxis and YTL Communications, that operates Yes 4G WiMAX. Surprisingly Time Broadband didn’t make the list and we feel they could be among the Top 5 if it wasn’t for TM’s duplicated entries.  To recap on the  methodology , Speedtest measures the average performance of each telco based on the fastest technology possible which is 4G LTE. So in theory, this wouldn’t take into account of speedtests conducted on 3G and on older non-LTE enabled devices. For fixed broadband ISP, the performance is calculated based on the top 10% of each network’s speedtest results. This according to Speedtest is to accurate represent customers that subscribe to the highest tier/package offered by the ISP.  While 4G telcos are  self proclaiming  the widest, fastest and best network, Speedtest is probably the best independent indicator for now. Another glaring difference between Malaysia versus other countries is that our mobile telcos are delivering faster speeds than our fixed broadband providers. In most cases, the fixed broadband providers in US, Canada, UK and Australia are clocking around 100Mbps or at least 2-3X faster than their fastest 4G operators. So what do you guys think of the verdict?  [  SOURCE  ]"

You won’t even need to lift a finger, permitted that you meet U Mobile’s requirements (nothing tough to begin with). Brimming on the fastest 4G LTE award given by Ookla and wanting to show appreciation to their customers, U Mobile will be handing out the aforementioned data free of charge to its customers only for the month of December. Though the only catch is you’d have to be on an existing U Mobile data plan. Extending across all its data services and customers; no matter if you’re on prepaid, postpaid or their broadband plans. As per minimum, for prepaid any UMI or iPlan will make you eligible for this special offer. Postpaid customers, just ensure you’re on the U28, P50 or P70, iPlans or UD plans. Lastly, broadband users on the MB Plan will be allocated the same free 1GB of data. The data will be bundled with your existing package, so there’s no nonsense about using this quota before getting the additional 1GB, not that it matters in the first place. Bear in mind that this is only a year end promo, so your extra 1GB of free data will only last you until New Year’s Eve aka 31st of December, 2015 only. To check up if you’ve actually received the data, you can refer to your UMB, SMS and U Mobile app. It’s no question that the orange telco learnt a thing or two from Digi’s offer that required customers to “activate” their free data, after their network outage – so kudos U Mobile for making it easier for your customers.

It’s going to take a lot more than product placement in a Bond film to revive the Japanese giant, or at least their mobile division, if they want to continue the Xperia brand. Adopting a two-time refresh every trading year, Sony dares to do something other smartphone makers would never even suggest in boardrooms, though have they kept up a timely trend? Or have these attempts been sloppy? What changed, other than the name? The changes are not for show, not on the outside anyway, so don’t expect to have friends ask you about your upgrade from the Xperia M4 Aqua, you won’t be getting that. It will however, get you a speedier and more fluid experience, since internally it gets upped in all aspects.

Now invitations have gone out setting the date for the Google x Huawei collaborative device and by the looks of it, some gift boxes might include them just in time for Christmas. Early adopters might already have the device in their hands, since  DirectD  began importing the units last week. They’ve been milking eager fans by a pretty margin but all is fair when it comes to grey importers, we suppose.   The aforementioned page that went up on vmall.my listed the device will be on sale for RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the 64GB model; which is equally stacked against another Huawei device, the  Mate S  (64GB). Easily pointing to the manufacturer not wanting to bite themselves in the butt by selling the Nexus at a lower price, to keep some emphasis on their other smartphones. Playing down the state of our currency, it’s likely the heighten pricing is to leave some leeway for the Ringgit to continue to fluctuate. Taking into consideration that the 32GB Nexus 6P sells for US$ 499 (RM 2,128) and the 64GB model goes for US$ 549 (RM 2,341) in the US. The collaborative effort will bring about the latest version of Android, with Marshmallow finally coming into the horizon. Sizing in at 5.7-inches, you’ll get a QHD display (2560 x 1440), with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 under the hood. Internal memory options were listed above, while it’ll carry 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM for multitasking and app switching. In terms of photography, there will be a 12.3-megapixel sensor on the rear that’s equip with 1.55 micron pixels and an aperture of f/2.0 for those low light situations. Accompanying the camera module will be a dual-tone LED and laser auto focus as well. Taking a look at the front, an 8-megapixel f2.4 shutter will greet you near the top; this sensor will carry a 1.4-micron pixel size. For audio, it’ll boast dual front facing stereo speakers on the top and bottom, while Huawei also deploys USB Type-C for data and charging utilisation. The port itself, will help charge up the 3,450mAh battery that’s inside, while  quick charge 2.0  the future-proof port will help bring it up to speed, just a little quicker – only on particular  chargers  though; nope those Quick Charge 2.0 charging heads won’t be of any use. The last bell and whistle would be the Nexus Imprint finger print sensor, that sits below the rear camera lens. A feature that pretty much lined up with Google’s vision to make native fingerprint scanning a thing on Android M. The announcement couldn’t come any sooner, since they’ve been consumers who are itching to get their own units after DirectD started offering the smartphone. Local warranty and a cheaper price seems like a no-brainer but we hope you waited."

We’d still think that driving an automobile is an experience best felt by being fully in control but they’re obviously perks to being able to have the ability to control your vehicle autonomously or through a remote. 
Pushing the boundaries of driving autonomously, the multi-talented UK based research team from Land Rover have been prototyping technology that allows you to move around your huge SUV or off-road beast, through fiddling with on-screen controls on your smartphone. 
Usher your Multi-point turn enabled Range Rover in a relatively controlled environment at a max speed of 4mph and manoeuvre your way through tight situations. Handing you controls for steering, breaks and accelerator, you’ll be able to be outside your car as you carefully move it around challenging terrain or hard to see parking situations – taking bad viewing angles out of the equation. 
Land Rover researchers also programmed the Multi-point turn technology to give those manning the virtual wheels the controls to adjust high and low range, angling the car in just the right manner to get around. It doesn’t stop there, as these in-built sensors on the car will apparently work in all weather conditions and environments, always enabling you to get yourself out of a tight spot, if need be. There are some limitations, such as range, when considering that you’ll only be able to “command” the car from a distance of 10 metres, all while your smartphone and smart keys are in close proximity. 
The team of researchers have also developed technology that allows you to turn your car a full 180-degrees in a tight spot; basically conducting a three-point turn. A much dreaded manoeuvre for anyone’s that has been in the driver seat of a large vehicle. Although other carmakers have already started implementing some of these options, it’ll be interesting to see how the idea of controlling your car from your smartphone’s will run along. It won’t please any motorheads but given the notion, it might be pretty cool. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Spending all your hard earned money on a fake device has to be one of the most heartbreaking things ever, so  OPPO  Malaysia teamed up with the Ministry of Domestic Trade Co-operatives and Consumerism (KPDNKK) to crack down on these counterfeit bandits. On the 20th of November at 11am, the operation began and both OPPO Malaysia and KPDNKK raided two locations, Plaza Alam Sentral in Shah Alam as well as Terminal 1 in Seremban. KPDNKK’s Intellectual Property Enforcement Division head Othman Nawang said that based on the information and intelligence gathered during the KPDNKK’s investigation, they had conclusive evidence to carry out the raid on these two locations suspected of selling counterfeit OPPO products. Sure enough the raid was a success as the joint task force uncovered 8 counterfeit devices worth over RM4,200. This may only seem like a fraction of the earlier reported 644 counterfeit devices, but at least these are devices that people haven’t spent their hard earned money on, so at it’s a start if nothing else. Among the phones confiscated, were fake versions of the OPPO Find 7 and OPPO N3. Othman said that the ministry had sent out recon teams to investigate the two locations and they found that these counterfeit devices were being sold between RM400 and RM700, which is a stark contrast to their original price range of RM1,000 to RM2,098. According to OPPO Overseas Customer Service manager Boyce Lee, this was the first raid to crack down on counterfeit phones conducted by KPDNKK. “Ever since we received reports in early January, we have been in close contact with the Ministry to further strike down these counterfeiting activities,” he said. “We have brought this to the Ministry’s attention that the circulation of counterfeit products are getting worse with each passing day and we seek legal actions to be taken by the authority.” Boyce added that to the layman, the counterfeit products’ design were almost indistinguishable from original OPPO products, but the devices’ poor design quality and unstable features tainted the OPPO name. He added that there was a possibility that the cheap parts used could have direct harmful or toxic effects on the user. If you have any qualms about whether or not your OPPO device is authentic, OPPO has a program that allows you to  check the device’s IMEI number  to determine authenticity. OPPO also encourages users who have any information regarding the sale or misconduct of counterfeit goods to contact KPDNKK on their hotline at 1800-886-800."

From skin makers like dbrand and Slickwraps, to pimped out editions with diamonds and just overall expensive devices from brands like Vertu; seems a powerful smartphone isn’t enough anymore for the rich. Those with a large net-worth need a little more from their smartphones and Priv owners can now join the upper class – as if adding gold to your smartphone elevates your status. While production quality of the video posted by Karalux seems to be subpar, they showcase the Priv with other devices that they’ve pimped out before. Basically the 24K gold replaces any metal accents that you’d find on the BlackBerry’s first Android device – which isn’t a lot to begin with, mainly on the back of the slide out, the rear camera and the top and bottom of the smartphone. As talked about earlier, existing Priv owners in Vietnam, will get to deck their units out for a cool US$ 350 (RM 1,491), though if you’re in the country and want the gold-plated Priv, it’ll cost you US$ 1,100 (RM 4,687). International buyers, it’ll cost you US$ 1,300 (RM 5,540), if you want the same thing shipped to you. Malaysians haven’t been too lucky, for no official information has come up on when the BlackBerry Priv will hit our shores. A spotting on  SIRIM  however, point towards an eventual release but still that’s pretty bare bones, as often these certifications don’t necessarily equate to being sold in our markets.

These three devices were announced during IFA in September and today they have finally arrived on our shores. Acer Liquid Z330 The entry-level Acer Liquid Z330 has a 4.5-inch FWVGA (854×480 pixels) screen, with a quad-core 1.1GHz Snapdragon 210 processor with 1GB of RAM running on the inside. The Liquid Z330 will come with 8GB of internal storage that is expandable via microSD. In terms of optics, the device will have a 5MP rear unit with an LED flash and 5MP fixed focus front camera. It will also come with a 2,000 mAh replaceable battery that Acer rates at up to 11 hours of talk time and up to 430 hours of standby time. Acer Liquid Z530 The second device launched is the slightly more powerful Acer Liquid Z530 which is powered by a quad-core MediaTek MT6735 clocked at 1.3GHz paired with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, also expandable via microSD. It will also come with a 5-inch HD IPS panel pushing 1280×720 pixels.  In the camera department the Liquid Z530 has a slight upgrade of it’s little brother as it comes with an 8-megapixel f/2.0 main camera with an LED flash to help it out in low lighting. The front-facing camera has also been upgraded to an 8-megapixel 84-degree wide angle lens to help with those we-fies. Powering these hardware components will be a 2,420 mAh battery rated at 12 hours of talktime and 630 hours of standby time. Acer Liquid Z630 At the top of the Liquid Z food chain sits the Liquid Z630 which comes with a huge 4,000 mAh replaceable battery. That massive battery will be powering a 5.5″ HD IPS display (1280×720 pixels) which brings it to a pixel density of 267 ppi. Under the hood, the top-of-the-range device will feature the same processor, RAM and internal storage as the Liquid Z530. The camera will also be an 8-megapixel front and rear camera that supports 1080p video recording. The front camera will also have a wide-angle lens. All three devices will support dual-SIM 4G LTE connectivity and comes running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box with Acer’s Liquid UI running over it. Both the Liquid Z530 and Liquid Z630 will support USB OTG, while the Liquid Z630 will also allow OTG charging from that massive battery, similar to  Lenovo ‘s  VIBE P1  and  VIBE P1m , something that is all the rage now it seems. The entry-level Liquid Z330 will cost RM439 while the higher spec Liquid 530 will set you back RM559. The top-of-the-range Liquid Z630 will be priced at RM659. These three phones are available right now at all authorised Acer dealers. Acer Liquid X2 As a little surprise, Acer also announced the Liquid X2, which will sport a 5.5″ HD IPS screen, powered by a 64bit octa-core processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The device supports triple-SIM 4G LTE, which is one of the first devices to have such support in Malaysia. Optics are also a big upgrade over the Liquid Z series as it sports a 13MP f/1.8 front and rear camera with an LED flash.  This Liquid X2 will draw power from a 4000 mAh battery. Acer announces that the device will come in two colours, black and gold, and is set to be available January 2016.

Alexander Wong,Guess which is the fastest mobile network in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/28/guess-which-is-the-fastest-mobile-network-in-malaysia/,"4G LTE,malaysia's fastest mobile network,Ookla,Speedtest,speedtest fastest network,Speedtest.net,U Mobile,u mobile 3g,U Mobile 4G","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-11-28,"Malaysian telcos (well, at least  two of them ) are obsessed with claiming the widest coverage for 4G LTE. When it comes to actual usage, speed is probably more important in our current connected age.  So who is the fastest? A popular internet speed testing tool has just named Malaysia’s fastest mobile network and the winner might surprise you. 
 U Mobile, Malaysia’s youngest mobile telco was just awarded the Fastest Mobile Network in the country by Ookla’s Speedtest. An impressive feat considering U Mobile is the last among the 4 telcos  to roll out 4G LTE . Despite not having extensive 4G coverage, U Mobile is capable of delivering high-speeds up to 42Mbps with its  3G HSPA+  network.  We’ve mentioned  several times  that the current 4G coverage race is getting rather silly. Any telco can throw numbers but ultimately what does it mean to the average consumer? For example, when Digi reclaimed the widest 4G LTE title, they  mentioned  that customers can expect 5Mbps speeds on 4G and more than 15Mbps on 4G LTE-A. Those numbers are low for 4G standards and they are already achievable with current 3G technologies. After all, it is not what you have, but what you do with it.  At the moment, Ookla has yet to publish the full Malaysian report on their  Speedtest Award  page but we assume that they used the same methodology here as other countries. The results are derived from the average performance recorded on the fastest technology possible which is 4G. Each test are aggregated by averaging each user’s test result at several locations each day. This prevents manipulation of repeated speedtests by a handful of users from affecting the overall result. You can read up how Ookla determine who’s the fastest over  here . So U Mobile subscribers, do you agree with this verdict? [  SOURCE  ]"

Its recently introduced  Piston V3 in-ear headphones  is pretty decent for a mere RM69 and if you’re looking for on-ear headphones, the more premium  Mi Headphone  is currently going for RM369. Now a newer Mi In-Ear headphones Pro version is coming and you can stand a chance to own one in Malaysia this coming weekend.   The new In-Ear Headphones Pro claims to be a hybrid unit with a dynamic driver accompanied by a two-way balanced-armature (BA) driver. This apparently is one of the smallest three-way headphones in the market that offers true reference quality audio. For a better audio experience, they have gotten help of Sound Engineer and Grammy/Latin Grammy Awards winner Luca Bignardi to tune the latest headphones.  In terms of build, it gets a diamond cut metal body with fine textures like its former Piston series. Designed for smart phone use, there’s also a built-in microphone with 3 dedicated buttons for volume and audio playback controls. For better durability, the Mi In-ear Headphones Pro uses kevlar for its cables for better durability in the long run.  In terms of specs, the new Pro headphones has a speaker impedance of 32Ω, similar to the V3 Pistons, but it is more sensitive at 101dB (V3 Pistons: 98dB). It weighs 14grams, which is the same as the current V3 but slightly heavier than the former V2.1 Pistons (12g). In China, the pair is going for 99 CNY (about RM66) but do expect a slight markup to buffer for potential currency fluctuation.  This coming Sunday (6th December), Xiaomi is organising an experiential event with 1 More’s Director of Product Marketing as their key speaker.

Rory Lee,Waze and Google Maps could expose Malaysia to “external threats” says UMNO MP,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/waze-and-google-maps-could-expose-malaysia-to-external-threats-says-umno-mp/,"external threats,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,navigation,parliament,Raime Unggi,TPP,trans-pacific partnership,umno,Waze","Industry in General,Mobile Apps",2015-11-26,"When we announced that  Google Maps ‘ offline navigation had finally rolled out in Malaysia, many rejoiced, but apparently not everyone is happy with being able to rely on navigation applications just a little more. UMNO lawmaker Datuk Raime Unggi said in Parliament today that Malaysian dependency on navigation apps to find their way around the maze-like labyrinth of Kuala Lumpur’s bustling city centre, was possibly exposing our country to “external threats” from foreign countries. The Tenom MP proceeded to elaborate that this was because when users use these applications for location searching, it indirectly provides information about Malaysia to external quarters such as the United States and Israel. The reason he cited these two countries, we assume, is because Google is headquartered in the US while Google owned Waze was developed in Israel. Kuala Selangor MP Datuk Irmohizam Ibrahim said that our nation cannot compromise when it comes to national security. He also brings up the issue about the extent to which our laws could protect such information leaks. “How far do we have laws that prevent information leaks in the usage of Google Map(s) and Waze?” he asks the Parliament. “Are there laws to make sure national security protected in the usage of such apps?” Communications and Multimedia Deputy Minister Datuk Jailani Johari reassured the concerned MPs that it was up to the users to decide how much personal information they wished to share and that they could choose to stop using the apps if they disagreed with the privacy policies. Jailani adds that the apps function based on privacy policies that are agreed upon by the individual and the application provider, be it Waze or Google Maps. If the user decides that they do not want to continue using the service, they can terminate the agreement and the provider will no longer hold on to their data. “We have yet to receive any report on any apps used for spying purposes. ‘The real issue is that our users are fond of over-sharing private information on the Internet. This results in the information being misused. As a smart internet user, we should have our own controls,” said Jailani, who is also the MP for Hulu Terengganu. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed also downplayed the danger claimed to be posed by the navigation applications, saying that these applications have helped citizens navigate more than it helps terrorists. He did however say that he acknowledges the security concerns, but he feels that the pros outweigh the cons. Kuala Krai MP Dr Mohd Hatta Ramli raised another concern that if the government decides to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) it could give foreign countries access to Malaysian personal data collected by the aforementioned navigation applications. “Our personal data used to be kept within the borders of the country,” he said. “Now with TPP, we must not allow it to be taken out of the county. We have a lot personal data that we would not like to share with other people.”. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-nation free trade agreement backed by the United States which is set to be debated in Malaysia in January next year. Opposition MP for Kelana Jaya Wong Chen said that the free trade treaty required Malaysia to allow transfer of electronic information to foreign countries. “TPP prohibition on data localisation laws (Article 14.13) essentially means personal info that is hosted abroad would be subject to different laws on privacy,” he said. Wong further explained that under this, your personal data could be subjected to US surveillance laws such as the US Patriot Act, instead of our own privacy laws. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ]"

Many owe this bad performance to the OEM’s disappointing 2015 flagship the  One M9  and how HTC didn’t go back to the drawing board when developing it. Perhaps it was because they were stubborn, or perhaps it was because of a lack of communication between the company and their customers that put them in this predicament. Well, HTC must’ve figured it was the latter because the smartphone manufacturer just announced that they are opening up the HTC Preview Program to all in the hope that it would help them better understand what exactly their customers want. In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on social, news and entertainment aggregation website Reddit, HTC’s USA Preview Team announced their intention to find a new way to connect back to the Android community, as well as answer any questions the community might have about this program. In a nutshell, this program will allow HTC fans to get their hands on the company’s latest software and hardware before it is released, in exchange for daily use and feedback. Yes, hardware too. In the  FAQ  hosted on the Preview website, it is stated that while those selected to participate in this program will occasionally require participants to use their own devices, depending on the specific HTC Preview projects, the OEM may also provide loaner devices too. It seems like a good opportunity to get your hands on some unreleased HTC hardware. Of course, as the primary purpose of this program is to identify daily user habits, user information and feedback has to be collected by the company. However, HTC has clarified that while there will be logs running in the background to collect data on network/signal strength, battery information, usage times and apps used, they will not collect any sensitive personal data or tell what you are looking at on your screen unless you explicitly take a screenshot to share with them. They also clarified that one of the reasons they have opened up the HTC Preview program is to have actual hard facts and feedback on what their users want. This is so that they have actual data backing them when they tell executives what their customers want, which in turn makes it easier to have an impact on change within the company. HTC also reassured the community that they will take the feedback from this program very seriously and will tweak their upcoming devices to improve based on that information. They also added that if feedback for a device is overwhelmingly negative, they would even use that information to evaluate a product’s release. This is a very bold move by HTC, bringing what looks like, on the surface at least, more transparency to their product development. It should also ignite a warm fire in the hearts of HTC fans who have been clamouring for their voices to be heard and who are passionate about helping the company grow past these hard times. However, as this has only just been launched, the actual effectiveness of this program remains to be seen. They could just be all talk and have no action. For whatever it’s worth, let’s hope this does help them get back on its feet because it would be such a shame if the company, which had brought us one of the most beautiful metal unibody designs, fell out of the race. For those of you who are interested, you can also participate in the HTC Preview program, just head on over to  their website  and follow the instructions there. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

Set to be the latest horse to enter the race, TM is setting its sights on a 2016 entry into the mobile telco industry in Malaysia. This will complicate things, to say the least, for the existing four players –  Maxis ,  Celcom ,  Digi  and  U Mobile . With the acquisition of Packet One Networks (P1)  in October of 2014, TM set out to develop them into their mobile arm and mobility centre, eyeing an end of 2015 launch of their mobile services. However, clearly pushing into the mobile sector proved difficult even for the telco giant, so TM have instead decided to take baby steps and only start user trials and network readiness tests come December. However, according to TM group chief executive officer Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, development of Telekom Malaysia’s overall LTE network rollout is on track, with the core LTE network being managed and planned for future growth by  P1 . “We are now building on that core to roll out nationwide, starting with urban areas and adjacent to existing base stations,” said Zamzamzairani. This isn’t TM’s first foray into the LTE technology as they had launched their very own LTE-based 4G broadband service,  TMgo  back in August of last year. TMgo was launched while the TM-P1 partnership was still pending approval, so it ran at a lower 850MHz frequency instead of the usual 1800MHz/2600MHz bands used by mainstream 4G operators. Now, with the full support of P1 at their backs, TM can really flex its muscles and push their way into the four-horse race. As with any industry, having more competition will only be beneficial for the consumer. With more competition, telcos have to tread carefully to keep their services relevant and avoid being run over by competition. With a major telecommunications player like TM entering the mobile services scene, you can expect the existing players who are currently locked in a four-way-free-for-all for LTE supremacy, to scramble and make sure the upstart new challenger doesn’t take their crown away from them. In any case, if TM successfully makes their way into the mobile sector, it can only mean good things for us consumers. We can realistically expect more competitive pricing,  more improvements in terms of coverage  and probably a whole lot more drama. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

The Mate 8 will be another aluminium unibody device that has come from the Chinese manufacturer but it’ll carry the newly released processor from their subsidiary Kirin, promised to blow away any of the current SoCs out there. Taking a close-up look at the 950 processor, it’s an Octa-core chipset that runs 4 cores at 2.3GHz and 4 other cores clocked to 1.8GHz. The manufacturer says that through the new “i5” coprocessor, the device will have a better power management system and allow speech recognition as well. Underneath along with the processor, are a combination of either 3GB RAM/32 GB internal storage, 4GB/64GB or 4GB/128GB, depending which model that you fancy. The 6-inch screen will run a native 1920 x 1080 resolution, and feature 2.5D curved glass from edge to edge all around the display. You won’t find much else on the front, aside from the 8-megapixel camera near the top. Moving onto the rear, there will be a fingerprint sensor located a step below the Sony IMX298 16-megapixel rear lens module. Huawei is finally migrating to Android’s new OS, Marshmallow, in the form of a EMUI 4.0 skin and feature a huge 4,000 mAh battery. Once it hits it’ll be available in 4 colours; Champagne Gold, Moonlight Silver, Space Grey and Mocha Brown. Retail price is set to 3,199 RMB (RM 2,118), 3,699 RMB (RM 2,449) and 4,399 RMB (RM 2,912)  – based on the memory configurations we’ve listed out earlier. You’ll have to wait till Q1 of next year before it arrives in stores for the international market, while it is readily available in China already. The prices seem daunting for something that would come from the smartphone manufacturer but it seems that they want to step up their quality and prices have to reflect that – compared to last year’s Ascend Mate 7, it gets a RM 1k price jump but will consumer bite? We’re not too sure, as of now. Huawei says we should expect the Mate 8 to be announced for the international market during CES this coming January, so stay tuned once the New Year arrives.

Next is now. By the turn of the new year, gift-giving season is ripe as day and everyone is out and about getting their loved ones something special. If you’re in the market for a large screened smartphone, you’d probably have the  Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+  on your wish-list, so why bother searching any further? With its great dual-edged glass display that tapers off at the sides, it’ll definitely be worthy as that special gift for someone special. Once 2016 hits, you’re going to be out and about again, taking all life gives you. Jostling between your work and play is already tough to begin with but with a premium pocket companion like the Galaxy S6 edge+, it’ll get easier. Designed with high-end aluminium and glass, the combo makes the 5.7-inch device a pleasure to hold in your hands. Captivate friends and family with its QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED screen, as you browse through shopping lists, and let them notice the nimbleness of the package. You’ll notice the dual-edged display immediately and it offers some great functionality too, making sure your loved ones are just a tap away. Measuring at 154 x 75.8 x 6.9mm, it has a small footprint for a device with such a large screen, while only weighing 153grams. Light but still sturdy in its make, with materials that are now more durable than its predecessor. 
Multi-tasking won’t be a hitch either, with its class-leading Exynos 7420 64-bit Octa-core processor and 4GB RAM that goes along with. Aimed at giving you a stutter free experience as you switch between all your online shopping applications, browsers and entertainment options. With those specs, you’d expect the Galaxy S6 edge’s camera to flaunt the same resume, and it does. Testing the same sensor found on the Korean company’s other flagship, the Galaxy Note5; our readers voted for it to be the best of the flagships – across all the other major players. Pleasing you with the 16-megapixel main camera, it won’t show any compromises while your capturing and sharing photos during the holiday season. Feel free to take images of the things you’d purchase and ask for opinions on gift ideas, the camera won’t disappoint. The front sensor will hold its ground too with selfies abundant during the festive period, though some might not be as lucky; having to spend this season apart, due to unforeseen circumstances – fret not, the 5-megapixel lens allows 4K video recording, so no pixelated videos during sharing. All that moving around while recording or taking photos during parties won’t hamper the main camera either, since it comes with optical image stabilisation (OIS); there’s also HDR (high dynamic range) on board the two cameras, so the objects and backgrounds of your pictures will have just the right mix of exposure, giving you the best photo. Share all the splendour with its wide array of connectivity options; you’ll find 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 and the works on board, never leaving you in a spot with cellular reception (unless it’s your telco coverage). The device will charge up quickly too, with Samsung’s own fast charge technology on the 3000 mAh battery. You can ditch cables too, if you have the supported Qi Wireless charging dock. TouchWiz is also less cluttered and more refined, since Samsung streamlining their signature skin based on Android’s operating system. There’s much to love about the Galaxy S6 edge+, a bigger screen, the same great flagship specs, and at a fair price of RM 3,099 (w/ GST), your loved ones would probably love it too."

And with the tide phenomenon that is expected to occur in the Straits of Tebrau from the 24th to 30th of November is likely to mean more trouble for affected locals. Malaysia has had its fair share of flood woes in the past and since it’s the rainy season again, the folks at Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) have decided to take a more proactive role to ensure effective communication during these potentially trying times remains strong. CFM have sent us a long list of tips that are designed to help the public better manage as well as communicate more effectively during times of emergency. We at SoyaCincau.com value your time and as a result have condensed their tips for your convenience. Here are the 6 communication tips during floods:   CFM strongly urges the public to be patient when communicating. If your call or msg is unable to get through to the other person, wait awhile before trying again. The communication infrastructure is put under a lot of stress during times of emergency and can get congested due to the high volume of messages. So, if everyone incessantly tries to communicate, it becomes less likely that any messages will get through at all. It’s sort of like traffic congestion, really. If everyone leaves their office at 6pm, then nobody would be getting anywhere anytime soon.   We know some of you have completely abandoned the SMS service, because frankly who needs it when you have free messaging applications like Whatsapp? But, CFM advises users to use this ‘retro’ form of communication during emergencies because they take up less bandwidth and will put a lighter load on the communication system. If we were to build on our traffic jam analogy, a call would be that large BMW 750Li, while a text message would only be a little Vespa zipping along between traffic.   Needless to say, without power, that flagship smartphone you paid thousands of ringgit for is about as useful as a brick. Probably less useful since its so light and thin, so CFM encourages its consumers to charge up your devices and power banks when there is power. That way, if and when the power goes down, you will still have enough juice to keep your phones running. Of course, saving power also means using your devices less often. Save them for emergencies and only use them when you absolutely have to, not to post a selfie on Instagram. If your device has power saving mode, it is recommended to enable it to extend its battery life.    Speaking of Instagram, CFM implores everyone to limit their online activity to avoid coverage congestion. Actions like uploading photos, videos or sharing voice clips on social media consumes a lot of bandwidth and by now we’re sure you all know what that means. Yep, you guessed it, congestion. 10 points to Gryffindor!   We’ve all seen disaster movies. We’ve all seen the scene where the protagonists are trapped in a danger zone and are waiting by the radio with bated breath for information that could very well save them. Well, it turns out there is some truth in those scenes as CFM says that it becomes an important source of news during an emergency. However, they have stated that consumers should ensure that they have an adequate battery supply before doing so. You can also get the latest updates from local emergency response services or RELA members so it’s a good idea to keep their contact handy.   Well, keep calm. There really is no use in panicking during an emergency.   CFM informs us that they aren’t sitting on their hands at their end either. The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) are working with all Telecommunications Service Providers (SPs) to provide temporary base communication station towers at several affected areas as a support to enhance the coverage during floods or natural disasters. However, they did add that priority will be given to places that are in need of it the most. They also ask for your understanding that natural disasters can cause unavoidable damage to infrastructure in affected areas which would result in less than stellar coverage. Teamwork is key in these situations so do be considerate and work together to overcome times of emergency.   [ IMAGE SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,Samsung says the Galaxy View is neither a TV nor a tablet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/samsung-says-the-galaxy-view-is-neither-a-tv-nor-a-tablet/,"Android,Galaxy View,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy View,Samsung Galaxy View Ad,Samsung Galaxy View Design,Samsung Galaxy View Specs,Smart TV,Tablet,TV","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-11-27,"Samsung has a knack for making devices of various screen sizes. The  Galaxy View  is their biggest yet with a gigantic 18.4″ screen and it runs on Android. In their latest ad, Samsung isn’t calling it a TV or a Tablet, but simply “entertainment reimagined”. Since both TV and tablets are generally media consumption devices, Samsung attempts to blur the line between the two, offering a larger screen experience in a somewhat “portable” form factor. Weighing at about 2.65kg, it is heavier than your average mobile device. With a handle at the back of the kickstand, Samsung wants it to be as easy to carry as a shopping bag. According to Samsung, the Galaxy View is designed to be used from an arm’s reach, hence they have created a new UI with larger icons and text for a more intuitive experience. Furthermore, the way people watch TV is much different now, with more opting to look for content when they want it, rather than to follow broadcast programs.  For gaming, the Galaxy View has an S Console game app, where you can project your mobile games onto a bigger screen. It turns your smart phone into a controller for a console gaming-like experience. While the hardware could potentially replace a TV, it is a pity that Samsung hasn’t included the essential TV ports such as HDMI. This could have opened up the Galaxy View as a portable TV for console gaming or to connect to other AV equipment.  In the US, it is currently priced at US$499 which is about RM2,110. It gets a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and there’s a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. With an on-board 5,700mAh battery, the Galaxy View can be used unplugged up to 8 hours. If it ever comes here, would you be interested to get one? [  SOURCE   2  ]"
Rory Lee,OnePlus offering refunds for their problematic USB Type-C cables,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/27/oneplus-offering-refunds-for-their-problematic-usb-type-c-cables/,,,2015-11-27,"Awhile back,  OnePlus  came under fire from critics and the tech community in general when it was discovered that their  USB Type-C cables were not spec compliant . This could possibly lead to damage if used with any device other than the  OnePlus 2 . Leading the charge was Google employee Benson Leung who had embarked on a crusade to purge the world of non-compliant USB Type-C cables. His method involved ordering cables off Amazon then testing them to see if they met the USB standards. When he arrived at the OnePlus cable, he found that even a cable manufactured by a proper smartphone manufacturer did not meet proper USB Type-C standards. Needless to say, the Caped Cable Crusader rained sweet justice down on the Chinese manufacturer, bringing them to their knees (metaphorically speaking, of course). Yesterday, OnePlus finally caved and admitted that their cables were indeed non-compliant, but it seems the USB Vigilante still isn’t entirely satisfied. OnePlus graciously accepted Benson and the community’s criticism, openly admitting on their official forum that their USB Type-C cables and adapters were using a 10kΩ resistor instead of the 56kΩ resistor detailed in version 1.1 of the USB Type-C port standard. This message came straight from the top, no less. According to the post, the issue with resistors was that the cables and adapter were only designed for a maximum of 2 amps of power, which is how much the OnePlus 2’s charger supports. However, when used on other devices that allow fast-charging, the resistor will let the devices try to draw more power than a power source may allow. Ultimately, this could result in damage to said power source (such as 3rd-party cables, USB ports, etc.) if they do not have an internal mechanism to self-regulate the amount of power flowing to or from them. OnePlus added that typically, if a charger has the CE, UL, or CCC markings, it should be certified and safe to use. The OEM also compiled their findings into a simple and easy-to-understand table detailed below: Unfortunately for OnePlus though, it appears that they didn’t get everything right. (ps. Click the read more button in the widget for the full post) Ah Benson, do keep up the good work! In any case, OnePlus is offering a refund on the affected products purchased through the OnePlus website. Do note though that the cables that came bundled in the box with your OnePlus 2 will not be eligible for a refund. This is simply because OnePlus remains firm in saying that the cables and adaptors are entirely safe to use with the OnePlus 2 and that the problem was compatibility with other devices. Based on the post, the refund appears to only be available for customers in North America, Europe, India and China, and will only be offered by OnePlus until the end of December this year. For those of you thinking of cashing in to get some cables at discounted Black Friday prices and then getting a full priced refund for them, tough luck, because it appears that both the cable and the adapter are out-of-stock on the OnePlus website.

Let’s face it. The internet is full of vulnerabilities and even our smart phones isn’t spared from exploits. Having your data stolen is not funny but you can take action now with Zipit Chat. Using a globally recognised encryption system, it gives you a peace of mind when communicating with your peers. So how does Zipit Chat work? Read on to find out. Zipit Chat is currently available for Android devices and you can download it directly from the  Google Play Store . For new users, activation is as easy as entering your mobile number and enter the verification code that’s sent to you. You’ll receive a unique Zipit ChatID that looks like a BlackBerry PIN and you can set your password between 6-16 digits.  Once that’s out of the way, you can start inviting your family and friends from your contact list. There are plenty of instant messaging apps out there but nobody does security better than Zipit Chat. Encrypted with AES 256 technology, your messages are impossible for anyone to intercept which gives you a true end to end encryption.  When transmitting sensitive information such as password, pins or confidential information, you can set a Self-Destruct Timer from 30 seconds up to 10 minutes. For an extra layer of security, Zipit Chat even disables your phone screenshot function, so that nobody could snap a copy of it.  Emails are still relevant these days and for business users, there are messages that are highly P&C. We’ve heard stories of email accounts being hacked and if it does happen to you, Zipit Chat can keep your email threads secured with the same military grade encryption. The content will be scrambled including its attachments and only the intended sender and recipient can view it fully via Zipit Chat.  If you’re unconvinced, Celcom had earlier issued a challenge for anyone to decrypt 3 messages that are encrypted by Zipit Chat and nobody has managed to crack it so far. So even if some snooping agency or hackers have gain access to your inbox, it would take probably years to figure it out by brute force.  Most people would have different logins and passwords for various accounts including online banking. If you find it hard to keep track of all of them, you jot them down safely under Zipit Chat’s Secure Notes. Similar to its email feature, it scrambles your note into a bunch of unreadable text, thus ensuring only you are able to read it.  While it is not recommended to store passwords on your phone, at least you know there’s a safer way to keep from prying eyes.  Having your phone stolen is bad enough and the last thing you want is to have your personal data stolen. With Zipit Chat, your messages, notes and emails are always password protected at all times. When left inactive, it will constantly require your pin number to launch the app. For another layer of secrecy, there’s a rather clever Stealth Mode which removes the Zipit Chat icon completely from your smart phone. To access the app again, just dial #*# followed by your pin number and then hit the call button.    Are you still putting your communication at risk? Just head over the  PlayStore  to download Zipit Chat. It costs RM10/month to subscribe but you can give it a try for free."
Rory Lee,Q Founder: Fossil’s first foray into Android Wear,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/q-founder-fossils-first-foray-into-android-wear/,"Android,Android Wear,Connected,fossil,Fossil Q Founder,Q Founder,Smart Watch,SmartWatch,TAG Heuer,TAG Heuer Connected","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch",2015-11-26,"When the idea of a smartwatch started gaining traction, many suspected that the watchmaking industry would eventually try to take it over. It seemed like a logical thing to do to keep up with the times. Fossil  thought so too and while initial models of their Q line hardly looked high-tech, their latest smartwatch, the Q Founder, does. The Q Founder is Fossil’s first ever smartwatch to be powered by Android Wear and it’s the watchmaker’s attempt at mating “modern functionality and classic good looks”. With this watch, Fossil hoped to give smartwatches the “high-end-yet-mass-appeal design Fossil’s known for”. Previous devices in the Q line, namely the Q Reveler and Q Dreamer bracelets, and the Q Grant watch were made to be jewelry first, technology second and it showed. To the untrained eye, it is nearly impossible to know that they were high tech smart wearables. Post Fossil’s new Q Founder though, is entirely different. This device sports a full touch screen interface on its round watch face similar to that of the  Moto 360 . Unfortunately, it also has the Moto 360’s flat tire design, instead of a fully round display. If classic watch looks were what Fossil was going for then the Q Founder does pull that off quite well. It certainly doesn’t look like it was  designed by a student in their first trimester  or one that could be  easily passed off as a generic Swatch watch . It is rather large though, coming in with a 46mm-diameter face and a 13mm-thick case which is the same as the expensive TAG Heuer Connected. Feature-wise, the smartwatch has a built in activity tracker that will help you track your steps, count calories and all the other good stuff. It’s also IP67 water and dust resistant so it’ll at least give you some peace of mind. Fossil estimates that the device will last one day on a single charge of the device’s 400 mAh battery. In terms of what actually powers the device, no information is available aside from the fact that it is likely an Intel processor due to their partnership. The device will also have 4GB of internal storage, an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Traditional watchmakers often  downplay the current smartwatches developed by tech companies  as more of a plaything that wouldn’t stand the test of time. However, with  TAG Heuer’s Connected  and Fossil’s Q line, it appears that takeover has begun. Fossil’s Q Founder is officially on sale at their website for USD295 (around RM1,243) but unfortunately, they don’t ship to Malaysia. Shipping to Singapore, however, is listed as an option on the website, albeit at a higher price of SGD665.50 (around RM1,991). When we tried to place an order though, there was an alert from the product page informing us that shipping to Singapore was currently unavailable. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

After images of the device leaked awhile back, official TENAA images have surfaced and it looks like the design holds true. The second-generation Galaxy A7 will closely resemble this year’s flagship Galaxy S6 with a metal band sandwiched between what looks like two planes of glass. Key internal specifications have also been revealed. The device, bearing the model number SM-A7100, will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.7GHz paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal memory. This is slightly different from our  earlier leak  which suggested that the device would be powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 610 processor. The Galaxy A7 will also feature a 5.5-inch OLED display pushing 1920×1080 pixels, and will come running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box, which are in line with earlier leaks. Imaging appears to be identical to the leaked specifications as well with the Galaxy A7 sporting a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing one for selfies. On paper it appears that the second-gen Galaxy A7 isn’t that much of an upgrade to it’s predecessor as the only notable difference is the extra 1GB of RAM. With specs like these, it begs the question, why bother upgrading? [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

Featuring twin batteries of the same capacity – 3,010 mAh, it also supports reverse through charging, so if your friend or family member is in a fix, just use the Marathon M5 to give their devices a quick charge up. The manufacturer claims that with the total 6,020 mAh of battery capacity, the device will get you up to 4 days of regular usage – roughly translating to a claimed 62 hours of talk time and 682 hours of standby time. And if that isn’t enough for you power hungry users, its extreme mode will give you another 62 hours of standby time at 5% battery; typically stripping you of everything except the bare essentials for the smartphone to receive calls and texts, probably. Other internals include a lowly 1.5GHz Quad-core MediaTek MT6735 processor, a HD (1280 x 720) AMOLED screen and 3GB of RAM with 32GB of internal memory to go along with it. You’ll also find Gionee’s Amigo 3.1 skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop on this device, that’s capable of 4G LTE through its dual-SIM slots. An IR blaster also makes an appearance on this 5.5-inch device. Talking about its camera, there will be a 13-megapixel rear shutter, followed by a 5-megapixel front camera and it’ll measure in these dimensions 152 x 76 x 8.55mm; it’s quite amazing to think that a 6,020 mAh battery can fit within an 8.55mm thick smartphone that weighs 215 grams. Those in India can pick it up for Rs. 17,999 (RM 1,137) on Flipkart in these colours; white, black and gold. We’re unsure how far Gionee will continue to reach out in the market space, maybe it might make an appearance in Malaysian markets soon. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

If you’ve tried out fitness trackers before you’d know that fiddling with the controls when all you want to do is start working out, can be a huge annoyance.

There’s a caveat though, SmartTrack only works when it senses activities with continuous movement.

To make matters worse,  LG  had only offered a vague explanation as to why the device was taken off the shelves late last week. This week, LG have finally decided to open up a little more and reveals that the device was pulled because of an issue with its display. When LG initially axed the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, the company  told Android Police  that there was a problem with the smartwatch’s hardware and it affected “day-to-day functionality of the device”. Because of the “complicated nature of the issue” LG told Android Police that they would be cancelling the rollout of the device indefinitely. They added that future device availability would be decided at a later time as their top priority was quality assurance. Now, an LG representative told English daily The Telegraph that there was an issue with “a new advanced component” that had “never been used in an LG wearable device before”. Not wanting to point fingers or burn bridges with suppliers, LG simply said that after hours of stress testing, the “advanced component” failed to meet their quality standards and would have affected the smartwatch’s image quality. With that out in the open, critics can safely guess that the “advanced component” is the watch’s P-OLED display. The device was the first smartwatch to achieve a 480×480 pixel resolution, rating the device’s 1.3” screen at a stunning 490 ppi. For more information on the device, head on over  here . OLED displays, though widely shipped in smartphones, is notorious for the amount of problems they come with such as image burn in and rotting pixels, something manufacturers have to work to mitigate. Since LG stated that the problem would only occur over the life of the device, Ars Technica suspects that it is due to significant image burn in or subpixel death. When pixels rot and die, the blue pixels are usually the first to go, resulting in a loss of brightness and inacurate colours, something we doubt any Watch Urbane 2 users would want. Besides its hyped screen, the LG’s follow up to the  Watch Urbane  was also set to be the first  Android Wear  device to have a built-in LTE modem. Being forced to drop such a high profile device after only six days due to an oversight in quality assurance must be incredibly painful for the electronics giant, something we doubt they will ever want to repeat. Large manufacturers often have large departments whose primary task is to ensure that their products meet the company’s quality standards, so it does seem a little odd that such a fundamental error was made by LG.

Alexander Wong,Samsung Gear S2: Unboxing and First Impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/25/samsung-gear-s2-unboxing-and-first-impressions/,,,2015-11-25,"Samsung has come a long way since its first smart watch, the  Galaxy Gear . Dropping its tech gadget looks for a more stylish appearance, the Gear S2 is their first model that comes with a round face. In the past, Gear smart watches seemed to be a technological showcase of what Samsung can do on a tiny form factor. They’ve experimented many things from cameras, infrared blaster, heart rate sensor and even the ability to make phone calls over 3G. More recently they had flaunted their flexible curved screen capabilities on the  Gear Fit  and  Gear S . Focusing on style, the Gear S2 and its Classic variant are designed to look like a normal wrist watch, while keeping its smart “internals” out of sight. Most people wouldn’t notice it is a smart watch until the screen lights up. The key differences between the Gear S2 and the Gear S2 Classic is the appearance and the choice of straps. The Gear S2 has a simple and modern look while the Gear S2 Classic features a ridged bezel, mimicking the looks of an timeless watch piece. To personalise the look, the Gear S2 uses its own proprietary straps which is easily replaced without tools. However you’re limited to what Samsung has to offer in each respective market. Meanwhile, the Gear S2 Classic has the added advantage with a standard 20mm leather band that can be replaced with any similar-sized strap. The rest of its hardware and features are identical underneath."

On-board there’s a non-removable 2,525mAh capacity battery and the side also features a 3-step alert slider that was first introduced on the OnePlus 2. For charging and data transfer, it settles for a more traditional microUSB port. Out of the box, it runs on OxygenOS that’s based on Android 5.1.1.

Rory Lee,Google Maps offline navigation finally available in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/24/google-maps-offline-navigation-finally-available-in-malaysia/,"Android,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,google maps offline navigation,Google maps offline navigation malaysia,HERE maps,offline navigation,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2015-11-24,"Earlier, we  reported that Google was finally offering offline navigation  for the  Google Maps  app on  Android  devices. This was to eliminate what Google called “screenshot jujitsu” and help the app better compete with other navigation applications like Here Maps as well as standalone navigation systems. Although the roll-out had officially begun, offline support for many parts of the world, including Malaysia, was still missing. Finally, after much anticipation, the application supports offline navigation within our home soil. With this feature, users can expect an improved navigation experience using the Maps app especially in areas where connectivity is bad, or when you want to save those precious few bytes of your quota. Google employs two different uses for their new offline navigation feature. The first is to bolster online navigation with the app, when connectivity is spotty at best, allowing Maps to freely switch between offline and online mode ensuring that you don’t lose crucial navigation information just because you entered an area with bad coverage. The second method is where users can opt to switch off connectivity completely and rely on the app to navigate with the pre-downloaded offline areas. To download an area, simply key in the location (or tap and hold a point on the map) and swipe up on the card that appears at the bottom. Then, select ‘download’ on the resulting screen, specify your desired region and tap the download button once more. Downloaded maps are stored on your device, so remember to free up some space before you decide to give this feature a spin. As an estimate, the amount of space required to download the greater area of Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur is about 300MB, whereas if you want offline navigation for Peninsular Malaysia, you will need to free up at least 1.5GB of space. Offline maps can be kept on your device for a total of 30 days. By default, stored locations will be updated via WiFi but that can be changed in the offline areas settings to allow for updates to be downloaded over a mobile network or to not be updated at all. This is definitely a bold move by Google, stepping into the world of offline navigation, but whether this move will pay off remains to be seen. Do give this feature a try the next time you need to navigate in unfamiliar territory, then let us know what you think of it in the comment section below. Does it stack up to already established offline navigation applications like Here Maps? Many thanks to  NightFelix  for the tip."
Arif Lee,TM wants to help you get a limited edition Star Wars Battlefront PlayStation 4 bundle,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/26/tm-wants-to-help-you-get-a-limited-edition-star-wars-battlefront-playstation-4-bundle/,"Battlefront,game,gaming,Playstation 4,PlayStation 4 Malaysia,promotion,PS4,star wars,Star Wars Battlefront PlayStation 4 Malaysia,Star Wars Battlefront PS4 Malaysia,Star Wars Malaysia,Star Wars PlayStation 4,Star Wars PlayStation 4 Malaysia,Star Wars: Battlefront,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM Playstation 4,TM Star Wars PS4,TM Unifi,TM UniFi advanced plan,TM UniFi PlayStation 4,Unifi,Unifi Advanced,UniFi PlayStation 4,UniFi PlayStation 4 Star Wars,Unifi promo,UniFi PS4","Cool stuff,Players on the Field,Promotions,Sony,TM,UniFi",2015-11-26,"The Force has been relatively strong of late, with trailers, memorabilia, and even gaming consoles all paying homage to the world of Star Wars. Fittingly, our dear landline and internet provider,  Telekom Malaysia  now has a  pre-order page  for the Star Wars Battlefront PS4 bundle only for their customers. That said, if you weren’t one of the lucky few that picked up your unit on Sony Malaysia’s online store, since units are now  sold out , here’s another chance. Fans of the Battlefront series will finally have their hand at playing the reboot to the original from 2004. Rated an 8/10 from IGN, the game itself is considered to be a first-person/third-person shooter and you’ll be engulfed in the battle of the Rebel Alliance against the Imperial Fleet. Dart across the worlds of Endor, Hoth, Tatooine and Sullust with characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Leia Organa and Darth Vader. Then again, you could easily pick up the game by itself and go on playing on your regular PS4 but that wouldn’t be as fun. Adding some great visuals on the 500GB console unit itself, with Vader himself being illustrated onto the front of the unit and one special DUALSHOCK 4 coloured in black, red and white to match the character. Other than the regular cables, AC power head and a one-year warranty, Sony also throws in four Star Wards Classics Voucher Cards that’ll give you access to exclusive games from yesteryears: Oh and they also add a 12-month subscription for PlayStation Plus in the bundle as well. Looks like there will be a lot of gaming happening towards the end of the year, what more with the holiday season coming around; this could definitely make a great gift for someone who loves the Star Wars series and gaming in general. Do note that this pre-order is only open to new or existing UniFi Advance Plan customers and the pre-order system will only begin at 3 pm on the 1st of December. No pricing has been mentioned by TM but as a reference point, Sony Malaysia lists it at RM 1,849 (w/ GST).

You would’ve heard it all before,  how their larger flagships starting showing up way before their 2015 Unpacked event in New York. To no surprise, we’re expecting the  Samsung   Galaxy S7  line to face the same fortunate (for us) fate. Addressing the potential processors inside the device before, today, new reports are alleging that Samsung might re-equip their flagships with one feature that when left out, have scorned their existing customer base; more so when Malaysia and other regions only received the 32GB for purchase option – yes, we mean reinstating a microSD slot on the smartphone(s) A plethora of options open up with 2016 on the horizon, with new processors and new camera technology, the possibilities are endless. The year will mark the latest generation of mobile processors as it’ll bring about launches of the Exynos 8890, Kirin 950, and the Qualcomm 820 – no matter how unnecessary these high-end chipsets might be, the thirst for more power and futureproofing devices aren’t slowing down one bit. It’s likely that the Galaxy S7 series will see two SoC options, one Exynos and one Qualcomm; both models listed above, though they might be region specific. Other specs purported by rumours would be the latest reversible USB Type-C port and a display that reacts differently when more pressure is applied. If that sounds familiar, it’ll be some sort of 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display you’ve seen on the current-gen iPhones and Huawei devices. The announcement of BRITECELL, Samsung’s new camera technology then brings better potential for low-light photography. Enhancing photos and light sensitivity in badly lit conditions and boasts 1.0µm. You can read more about that  here . It’s been said that the Galaxy S7 edge will not be dual edged on the sides but instead have the same tapering glass on the top and bottom. Given the circumstances, this would be possible, since the manufacturer did patent a top-to-bottom curved display of late. Leaving leaks and rumours as they are, it’ll be interesting to see how redesigned the next flagship devices from Samsung will look like; since we can already expect them to go all the way when it comes to internal components. Would you spare Samsung another look, if they toyed with the idea of putting a microSD card back inside? Was that one of the reasons that made you leave the Galaxy series?

This isn’t that new though, since the feature has been living on your apps since the 8 th  of November for Android users and the 19 th  of November for iOS devices.

Stream your content to bigger screens through iflix integration with Google’s Chromecast, enabling you to keep it on your phone but take it to another level onto TVs if needed. The application and service has now reached 3 countries – Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, with their reach promised to grow throughout other SEA countries in the near future. Amassing 850,000 users in just half a year, the company envisions that this new product feature will “address the demands and challenges faced by consumers in emerging market, including inconsistent infrastructure, expensive and limited mobile data allowances. The launch of Download and Watch Offline is a testament to our commitment to provide the best service and experience possible to our subscribers.” – to quote Mark Britt, Group CEO.

Details after the break. Huawei is expected the launch the  Nexus 6P  in  Malaysia  sometime next month. If you can’t stomach the  imported Nexus 6P price  of RM2,899, it is recommended to wait for the official units that come with local Malaysian warranty. Now it looks like we finally get a glimpse of its pricing through a slip up made on  vmall.my . The folks at  Amanz  had spotted a Nexus 6P page which shouldn’t be live at this point of time. It lists the 5.7″ Nexus phablet at RM2,698 including GST and the spec sheet has indicated 64GB of on-board storage that comes in either Aluminium and Graphite colour options. At RM2,698, it is priced the same as their current premium  Huawei Mate S  that also comes with 64GB of storage. The page is no longer accessible but it is still viewable through  Google Cache . At the moment, we can’t really confirm if this is the actual price but it looks quite legit considering the Nexus 6P is priced at $499 (about RM2,127) for 32GB and $549 (about RM2,340) for 64GB in the US. To recap, the Nexus 6P has a 5.7″ Quad HD display and it runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM. It also gets a 12.3MP /f.20 main + 8MP f/2.4 front cameras, front stereo speakers, a fingerprint scanner and a 3,450mAh capacity battery that supports QuickCharge via USB Type C. Out of the box, it runs on the very latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, making this the device to get for the Android purist. UPDATE (24/11/2015)

Rory Lee,UE BOOM review: The singing soda can,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/24/logitech-ue-boom-review-the-singing-soda-can/,,,2015-11-24,"I never understood the need for a portable wireless speaker. Don’t get me wrong, I love my unnecessary gadgets. In fact I have an entire argument laid out about how I absolutely need a tablet/laptop hybrid even though I already have a laptop. desktop and phablet. That said, I just never saw the point of the Bluetooth speaker. I’ll admit, I’m no audiophile. Nor was I born in the time frame where “Say Anything…” was a thing. So the notion of carrying around an extra, rather heavy and rather expensive device just to play my music out loud – something I personally detest – seemed incredibly perplexing. Now that we’ve established my comic-book-esque origin story, we arrive at  Ultimate Ears BOOM  (UE BOOM). Bought over by Logitech in 2008, Ultimate Ears have been making audio equipment since 1995. Their latest device, the UE BOOM, is an RM799 Bluetooth speaker the size of a can of ping pong balls, designed to be rugged as a rock and perfect for when you need to play your music out loud for everyone to hear. I think you can see where this is going. I thought so too when I started this review, but now, now I’m not so sure."

As they often say, better late than never. This late arrival isn’t unprecedented since the same smartwatch had issues launching in China but that was mainly due to Android Wear compatibility and Google services restrictions in the country. Going for the rather traditional approach, the watch itself is a circular watch face that sports a sapphire crystal screen. Taking a second look at the device for those who aren’t too familiar with its specs; it carries a 1.4 inch AMOLED screen with a 400 x 400 resolution. While running the show underneath its stainless steel body is a Snapdragon 400 SoC mated to 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. Syncing and connectivity will go through Bluetooth 4.1 and you’ll find the typical fitness centric sensors inside, allowing you to track your heart rate, steps and calories too. The Huawei Watch has a 42mm footprint and on the top right you’ll notice a 18mm lug to go along with it. Powering everything will be a 300 mAh battery and at the same time it’s compatible with Android and iOS devices that run at least 4.3 or iOS 8.2, respectively.

However, in terms of raw air cleaning power, the new model appears to fall short of the previous version, but not by a lot. Probably due to its size, the second-gen purifier outputs clean air in two modes, measuring a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of 330 m3/h of clean air in standard mode and 388 m3/h of clean air in active mode, both of which are lower than the original Mi Air Purifier’s 406 m3/h. Cleaning range is also lower at up to 46.6 m2 of cleaning range, compared to the first-gen’s 48 m2 of effective coverage. It can also be attributed to the device’s single-motor, dual-fan setup versus its predecessor’s dual-motor, 4-air-duct engine. Despite that though, it boasts the ability to remove 99.7% of PM2.5 particles in just one hour, thanks to its triple filter setup. This isn’t to say that this new kid on the block is worse than its predecessor, because in every other aspect the sequel is an improvement. First off it is much smaller and lighter, measuring 240x240x520 mm versus the old air purifier’s 260x260x735 mm. It is also 58% more energy efficient and 11% quieter, weighing in at only 30db in Night mode. With the price of the Mi Air Purifier 2 set at RMB699 (around RM463), it is also much cheaper than the RMB899 (around RM596) Mi Air Purifer. Is the reduction in clean air output and coverage a trade-off you’re willing to make for a lighter, smaller, cheaper, quieter and more energy efficient air purifier? I know we are. [ SOURCE ]"

Offering the same compact 7.9″ size, the new tablet gets an all metal body which is a huge leap over the plasticky predecessor. Compared to the previous version, the new Mi Pad 2 is 18% thinner at 6.95mm (Mi Pad: 8.5mm) and it is 11% lighter at 322g (Mi Pad: 360g). The Mi Pad 2 is also narrower and shorter as well, thanks to its reduced bezel design.  The front 7.9″ display is pretty much retained with a 2048×1536 resolution that pushes a pixel density of 326 ppi. This is the same resolution as the current  iPad mini 4 . Some of the new improvements include a Reading Mode which cuts down on harmful blue light and a button lock feature which deactivates the capacitive home, menu and back buttons when the tablet is held in landscape.  While the old Mi Pad runs on Nvidia’s Tegra K1 chipset, the Mi Pad 2 is Xiaomi’s first Intel-powered device with a 14nm 64-bit Atom X5-8500 processor with 2GB of RAM.  Storage wise it receives the same options of either 16GB or 64GB of storage. This time round, it appears that it lacks a microSD expansion slot, which isn’t good news for those wanting to store loads of TV shows on their tablet.  The cameras combination appears unchanged with a 8MP f/2.0 camera capable of shooting full HD videos at the rear while the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter. The twin speaker grilles are still placed at the back, which could have been better placed at the front or at least on the sides. Powering the tablet is a smaller 6,190mAh battery that claims to push 100 hours of music playback or 12.5 hours of video streaming. It uses the new USB Type C connector to charge and it supports a typical 5V/2A fast charging standard. In terms of connectivity, it supports Bluetooth 4.1 and high speed 802.11ac WiFi. Like the predecessor, there’s no cellular 4G LTE version available.  Out of the box, the Mi Pad 2 runs on MIUI 7 OS that’s based on Android. The 16GB Mi Pad 2 goes for 999 CNY (about RM662) while the 64GB version is priced at 1,299 CNY (about RM861), which is pretty decently priced for the hardware and build quality it offers.  If you’re looking for something different, Xiaomi is also releasing a Windows 10 64GB edition as well for the same price of 1,299 CNY. It offers a full Windows experience, supporting your popular Microsoft office apps for greater productivity in a compact form factor. For more info, head over to the  Xiaomi Mi Pad 2  product page."

Especially when consumers in China are so spoiled for choice when it comes to mobile electronics.  Xiaomi  lead the pack during the momentous day, raking in a cool RM 856 million but was that enough reason for them to release the  Redmi Note 3  so early? Well they did it anyway, and for the first time it features an all-metal design, biometric security and a huge battery. 
 The Chinese manufacturer places high hopes on their most “premium” (if that word is fair) Redmi Note to date. Let’s talk about how it has changed, taking over the Redmi Note 2 in the most casual way possible; the biggest change would be the utilisation of a smooth metal finish – made by sandblasting the metallic layer. Surrounding the smartphone with the element and curving at the edges. Apparently, these curves will make the device more ergonomic when held, it’ll also just weigh 164grams, 4g heavier than the smartphone it replaces. Even with its massive 4000 mAh battery, the Redmi Note 3 will only be 8.65mm thick. They’ve managed to do this by using a 690Wh/L high density battery, that saves space underneath frame. Something really different this time around, the Redmi Note 3 will include a rear fingerprint sensor – a feature that has never been seen on older Xiaomi devices. They promise that you’ll be able to get into your device in less than 0.3seconds with the touch of your fingerprint. As far as recognition goes, the Redmi Note 3 will store up to 5 fingerprints, if you’d want to give other prying individuals the ability to unlock your pocket companion. It’ll also give you access to make secure payments through the aforementioned sensor. Otherwise it says relatively the same – which wasn’t awful to begin with. Here’s a recap on those specs: A MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. It’ll have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear. Moving your way up front, you’ll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor. A power-packed package with near flagship like specs, since they’ve added a 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal memory option. Oh and did we mention; it’ll sell from RMB 899 (RM 596) and be available in 3 colours – Silver, Dark Grey and Gold. The higher end 3GB RAM + 32GB ROM will go for RMB 1,099 ( RM 728) Going full mental (oops metal), Xiaomi has a lot going for it with its new smartphone and we expected the device to sell for at least RM 800 in Malaysia, but we’ll only know for sure when/if it arrives here.

Rory Lee,Hands-on with the Lenovo Vibe P1 and Vibe P1m,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/21/hands-on-with-the-lenovo-vibe-p1-and-vibe-p1m/,"5000 mAh battery,Android,big battery phone,lenovo launch malaysia,Lenovo Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1,Lenovo Vibe P1 Malaysia,Lenovo Vibe P1m,Lenovo Vibe P1m Malaysia,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-21,"Launched recently, the  Lenovo Vibe P1  and  Vibe P1m  are designed to last as long as you can with its enormous battery capacities of 5,000 mAh and 4,000 mAh respectively. These smartphones from  Lenovo  can also, in a pinch, double as powerbanks and charge your other devices via USB OTG (On-The-Go). As you can tell by the battery capacities, the Vibe P1 is designed to be the flag bearer of the “Power Player” line, while the Vibe P1m comes in as the runner-up. On paper that is very much the case as the Vibe P1 sports a 5.5″ full-HD IPS display and a brushed aluminium frame. The device’s unibody construction gives it a premium feel with a gentle curve at the back allowing the phone to fit nicely in the hand. In front you will find the front camera at the top and two capacitive buttons at the bottom, flanking the rectangular physical home button. Underneath the clicky, well-built button lies the Vibe P1’s fingerprint scanner which is a first for Lenovo. Around the back, the smartphone looks a lot like the flagships from  HTC’s One  series. The main camera can be found at the top of the phone with the dual-LED flash right below it. The power button and volume keys are placed on the right side of the phone while the Vibe P1’s dedicated power saver toggle is located on the left. To differentiate the buttons, the power saver toggle has rough texture versus the smooth power and volume buttons. Either way, all the keys have a satisfying click without much wobble. The speaker grille and micro-USB port is located at the bottom opposite the phone’s headphone jack at the top. The top comes off revealing a tray that holds two nano-SIM cards and a microSD slot. As a whole, the device feels good in the hand. Even with that massive battery, the weight isn’t unbearable although it is rather thick and that adds to the bulk. The brushed aluminium helps the phone stay in the hand while staving off fingerprints. Much of the Vibe P1’s physical features are identical on its little brother, with the exception of the micro-USB port being on the top and the absence of a physical home button and fingerprint scanner on the Vibe P1m. Around the back, the primary camera is in the same place as the Vibe P1 but there is a brushed metal finish around the lens LED flash. The front is occupied by the Vibe P1m’s 5-inch 720p display, three capacitive buttons and the 5-megapixel camera at the top. The device is coated with a splash-proof nano coating. While the P1m does not have a brushed aluminium back, the textured removable rear cover feels very nice and sturdy, giving the phone even more grip. The smaller size also fits better in the hand, making up for its rather thick profile. Within the Vibe P1 beats the heart of an octa-core Snapdragon 615 clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and, 32GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB via microSD). On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m is powered by a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 16GB but it is also expandable via microSD up to 32GB. Performance is good as both devices run smoothly on Android 5.1 Lollipop with almost no stuttering or noticeable lag when launching, exiting or switching between applications. It looks like Lenovo spent some time making sure that the software and hardware for both devices were well optimised. Then again, the Vibe P1m’s smooth performance can also be credited to the fact that it has less pixels to push on that smaller 720p display. Primary imaging on the Vibe P1 is taken care of by its 13-megapixel PDAF rear shooter while selfies can be delegated to the 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera. Our limited time with the Vibe P1’s camera reveals that it is snappy to launch and take pictures, but the venue’s poor lighting made it difficult to give a solid verdict on the camera’s performance. The same can also be said for the Vibe P1m’s 8-megapixel rear/5-megapixel front camera combo. Sitting under the back plate, powering all those hardware bits, lies the devices’ defining feature: their massive batteries. The Vibe P1 sports a 5,000 mAh battery that Lenovo claims gives the device 30 days of standby time and 45 hours of talk time. The phone also comes with Quick Charge 2.0 for when it eventually runs out of juice. Lenovo said that it would take 2 hours to charge up the P1 from empty using the device’s bundled charger. The Vibe P1m features a smaller, but still massive by conventional standards, 4,000 mAh battery. Besides the massive batteries, Lenovo took power saving to the next level with their included power saver toggle, available on both devices. With the power saver toggle flicked on, the phone enters power saver mode where the usual home screen is replaced by a simple black and white interface, showing you the clock, the battery level, a choice of six apps and how much time you have left before the phone runs out of juice. Very Jack Bauer. The six apps can be set by the user but by default three of the app slots are taken up by phone, contacts, and messaging. The Lenovo Vibe P1 which retails for RM1,199, will come in Platinum and Graphite Grey colour options. This device will be available in authorised retail stores and  online at Lazada  starting 19 November. On the other hand, the Vibe P1m, costing RM649, will  sold exclusively at Lazada  from 19 November onwards, only hitting the shelves at authorised local retail outlets in December. As a bonus though, if you do choose to purchase the Vibe P1m from Lazada, they’re currently offering an RM50 discount and are throwing in a Lenovo Limited Edition Jersey and an 8GB SanDisk microSD card for free.

Microsoft has sent out invitations to Indian Windows Insiders for the launch event of the two devices, set for 30 November in Mumbai and New Delhi, which hints at a possible Malaysian launch soon. The event in Mumbai and New Delhi is set to begin at 6PM IST and attendees can get a chance to try out both devices as well as the Microsoft Display Dock. They would also get to experience a live demo of Continuum for Phones. This invitation came shorty after invitations to the 2nd November launch event in the UK were sent out. Windows Insiders who are going will also be able to purchase a Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL at the event through a sales package that includes a Microsoft Display Dock. Before you turn green with envy, this launch in India, coupled with the fact that both devices have already received certification from SIRIM, is a very good sign that you will be able to have these devices in your hands very, very soon. As a recap, the Lumia 950 will come with a 5.2” Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display, pushing 2560×1440 pixels. The device will be running on a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 chip clocked at 1.8GHz paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Though lacking the power of some of the other flagships launched this year, Windows devices are commonly known to be incredibly optimised, thus requiring less raw power. It will also come with a microSD card slot allowing for storage expansion of up to 200GB. On the other hand, the bigger Lumia 950 XL will feature a larger 5.7-inch (2560×1440 pixels) QHD AMOLED ClearBlack display but with Gorilla Glass 4 on top instead of its younger brother’s Gorilla Glass 3. Internals see the Lumia 950 XL powered by a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board memory. Like the Lumia 950, the Lumia 950 XL will also have an expandable microSD slot that will support up to 200GB of extra storage. The Lumia duos party piece lies at the back of the phone in the form of a 20-megapixel  PureView  camera with a large f/1.9 aperture lens, OIS and a triple-LED flash.

If you’re into a non-Android Wear or Apple equivalent wearable, you might just be in luck, as ASUS will start taking pre-orders for their no frills activity tracker, the VivoWatch from tomorrow onwards. Brought to you by ALL IT Hypermarket, the pre-order will only last for two days, the 21 st  and the 22 nd  of November. Announced on ASUS’ Facebook page, the device will be available for you make your orders at these ALL IT Hypermarket outlets: Setting itself in a different category, that sees watchmakers and mobile companies making true smart watches reliant on Android Wear, WatchOS and Tizen; ASUS wants to have the same game plan as FitBit, Pebble and the likes. So that means you’re buying into a device that only displays black and white on its 1.28-inch screen. It does have perks, being a low powered system, the VivoWatch will get you up to 10 days of claimed battery life – if true, that lasts a whole lot longer than the supposed 7 days by the two other companies mentioned. While running a KoodOS, its outer looks could closely resemble the ZenWatch, from a far. The 128 x 128 resolution black and white Gorilla Glass 3 screen won’t take your breath away but it gets the job done. Edged out with stainless steel, pairing will be done through Bluetooth on devices running Android 4.3 (and up) as well as Apple devices running at least iOS 8.1.

Rory Lee,"From soft drinks to smartphones, the Pepsi Phone P1 is now official",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/20/from-soft-drinks-to-smartphones-the-pepsi-phone-p1-is-now-official/,"Android,Pepsi,Pepsi P1,Pepsi Phone P1,Pepsi smartphone,Phone P1,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-20,"It’s official. Soft drink mega-corporation Pepsi has taken its first step into the mobile industry by launching its own crowdfunding campaign on JD Finance to  fund its very first smartphone , the Pepsi Phone P1. Back in October,  a source in Pepsi leaked the news  that the soft-drink manufacturer would be releasing their own line of mobile accessories and even their own smartphone based in China. While preliminary specs were leaked, the information train stopped there and interest in the device screeched to a halt. Now that the world’s 29th most valuable brand has pulled back the covers of its pet project, we finally get to see some cold, hard specs. The device will come sporting a 5.5” 1080p display housed under 2.5D glass, with an octa-core 1.7GHz MediaTek MT6792 processor and 2GB of RAM at its heart. It only has 16GB of internal storage but that’s expandable via a hybrid dual-SIM tray up to 64GB. Out of the box, the device is said to run on Android 5.1 Lollipop with dido OS 6.1 plastered on top. For imaging, the device runs a 13-megapixel (f/2.0, 1/3.06 CMOS sensor) back snapper and 5-megapixel front camera combo. Interestingly, the Phone P1 also mounts a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device, right below the camera. To bring all of these parts to life, the phone will draw power from a 3,000 mAh battery. Since it’s a crowdfunding project, the device will be available through several layers of perks and support. The early bird option allowed interested parties to get the phone for CNY499 (around RM335), but that was only limited to the first 1,000 supporters. You can still opt for the limited CNY699 (around RM468) option which is still a good deal. Backers can also opt to get the phone at its full price of CNY1,299 (around RM870) instead. With only two weeks remaining, the Pepsi Phone P1 is still a long, long way from being funded so there is a chance that this whole thing could just fizzle out. If it does succeed though, it would be interesting to see if Pepsi’s nemesis Coca-Cola would take a gander at a mobile device. Specs wise, the phone looks like a fairly ordinary midrange device, but with its metal body we suspect that people will buy this purely as a novelty item rather than to use as a daily driver. All we’d like to see is for the device come in a phone sized Pepsi can instead of a boring old smartphone box. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"
Rory Lee,Samsung’s latest W2016 smartphone is a clamshell with flagship specs,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/22/samsungs-latest-w2016-smartphone-is-a-clamshell-with-flagship-specs/,"AMOLED,Android,clamshell,Flip phone,Samsung,samsung clamshell,samsung flip phone,Samsung Galaxy Golden,Samsung Galaxy Golden 2,Samsung Galaxy Golden 3,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung W2016,smart phone,smartphone,W2016","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-11-22,"Mistaken as the  Galaxy Golden 3 in earlier leaks , Korean electronics giant  Samsung  have quietly revealed their latest handset, the W2016. If you’re familiar with Samsung’s line of clamshell smartphones running Android, then it should come as no surprise that many thought this latest flip phone was going to be the successor to the Galaxy Golden 2. This new flip phone is no underpowered feature phone though. Sporting two 3.9” AMOLED displays pushing 1280×768 pixels, an  Exynos 7420  chip, 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage, this flip phone is essentially a  Galaxy S6  in a forgotten form factor. The primary camera is no slouch either as it likely the same high end 16-megapixel rear snapper as that in Samsung’s early 2015 flagship, with a 5-megapixel front camera to boot. Samsung’s W2016 will run  Android  5.1.1 Lollipop with TouchWiz out of the box and the Korean manufacturer has also included modern elements like fast wired and wireless charging. Powering the device is a 2,000 mAh battery, which should be more than enough for the relatively small 3.9” screens to stay lit for a respectable amount of time. To many, the clamshell form factor is a thing of the past and it seems weird that Samsung would put so much into reviving it. But to some niche markets in Asia and nostalgic fans of this once glorious design, this is a welcomed move and we can see why. Aesthetically, the W2016 looks exquisite. The body is a sculpted aluminium frame that kind of emulates the Galaxy S6’s design, with a curved metal back and metallic accents. The screen sits flush into the front panel and the gentle slope towards the bottom of the phone gives it a much sleeker look. It looks like the kind of sophisticated device meant for the 0.01%, and not some playboy’s new gadget. Availability of the device at this point seems to be limited to China, without any news on whether or not it will make it to the rest of the world. While we do not have information on the pricing of the device, we wouldn’t be too surprised if it will eventually be sold elsewhere. On paper, the W2016 looks like a great way to bring the clamshell into today’s standards. For those of us who have used flip phones in the past, there is no doubt that we will remember this form factor fondly. Let’s face it, there aren’t many more satisfying ways to end a conversation than with the solid click of a clamshell snapping shut. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

Word had gotten out of TENAA that a smartphone had passed its certification; after which details of the  Mi Pad 2  were spotted on Geekbench. Then on it got a whole lot for confusing, as  invitations  of the event went out and Xiaomi’s President  leaked photos  of the two devices. We’re going to try and make it easier for everyone to understand, at the same time giving out two cents on the whole situation. Metal isn’t one of the materials you’d usually find on a Xiaomi product, except for their higher-end range flagships – though the Mi Note and Mi 4 only explore using the element in minimal amounts, seen around the edges. The brand however, hasn’t started even considering finger print sensors on their flagships, hence the peculiarity of placing the aforementioned feature on the Redmi Note 2 Pro. It’ll be a totally new take, for the Redmi name if they decide to pursue the two features. Otherwise, it’ll have the same internals as its predecessor underneath. Moving to the other device that’s slated to launch, the Mi Pad 2; a device that didn’t confuse us as much as the former. Details on Geekbench made this short and sweet, stating what processor it’ll carry; an Intel Atom processor clocked to 2.24GHz and other accompanying specs. Speculators being speculators, word went about that Xiaomi might release their anticipated Mi 5, but so far, nothing seems to corroborate this. Shared by company President, Lin Bin, an invitation for tomorrow’s event went out with the headline “The Best is Yet to Come”; making this all the more confusing . Xiaomi’s President didn’t stop there either, shortly after a few days, he decided to release photos of the smartphone and tablet. Leading us to finally cave in and actually believe that the company will release a follow up to the Redmi Note 2 before the same fiscal quarter comes to a close. Since then, more images go to contradict the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro, mentioning that it’ll instead be dubbed the Redmi Note 3. So far we know that it’ll be thin, light, have a fingerprint sensor and metal body. It isn’t farfetched to assume that Xiaomi wants to appeal to the higher-end market but adding two features on a non-flagship could either be a weird strategy or an opening of doors to more premium products in the future from the Chinese tech giant; yes, the Mi 5 too. Interestingly, new (rumoured) details have highlighted that the Redmi Note 3 will have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’ll also supposedly be available with a 4000 mAh battery, making a huge jump from the existing device that only has a 3060 mAh battery. Maybe this long-shot might work for Xiaomi but we’re sure Redmi Note 2 customers won’t be too happy with this new information. We’ll wait for tomorrow to see what actually happens, who knows they might pull a “by the way” move and surprise everyone with more than two devices. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"

Awhile back we reported on an issue where users discovered that the glass panel on the back of the Nexus 6P was spontaneously cracking, probably due to the phone’s metal body as metal is a substance that is very reactive to heat. Now, it seems that  Google ’s premium Nexus phone has encountered a new problem: spotty voice quality. Several threads on the Google Product Forum and XDA-Developers have spawned with users complaining that people on the other end of their phone conversations couldn’t hear them very well. The problem appears to extend to the speakerphone as well. Based on unofficial experimentation by Nexus 6P users, it appears to be a problem with the phone’s noise cancellation setup. Some users say that covering the rear microphone solves this issue while others discovered that this actually causes the problem. For those who are unaware, most new smartphones use multiple microphones to supplement the main microphone to filter out surrounding noise, like wind, to improve the vocal clarity of phone calls. The root of the problem does seem to be related to this setup on the Nexus 6P as one of the users who posted on the Google forum indicated that a root-level build.prop modification solved the issue for him. On the plus side, Google representatives have responded to the posts on the official forum, letting users know that they are looking into it though as of this moment there is no official statement on the cause of these problems. Let’s hope that Google can fix this issue with a software update and not have to resort to recalling users’ shiny new Nexus 6P devices. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

BRITECELL was not the rumoured Galaxy S7 1/2-inch sensor with large pixels though as it actually has smaller one micron pixels. Samsung says that these smaller pixels will help reduce the module height by 17% while maintaining low-light sensitivity at 1.12µm. The sensor also utilises Samsung’s Smart WDR technology which will help provide a more detailed image by using multi-exposure for better spatial resolution and Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF) for faster, more accurate photos. Although the electronics giant did not confirm whether this BRITECELL technology would be used in their smartphones, if they do, the Galaxy S7 could very well be the first one to receive it. With the BRITECELL’s focus on improving low-light performance, the next-generation Samsung phones could be significantly better than its predecessors. To get a gauge of what one of Samsung’s current phone’s camera can do, have a look at the smartphone  camera comparison we did back in October . [ SOURCE ]"

Arif Lee,Official teaser by Xiaomi’s President confirms the existence of the Redmi Note 2 Pro and the Mi Pad 2,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/20/official-teaser-by-xiaomis-ceo-confirms-the-existence-of-the-redmi-note-2-pro-and-the-mi-pad-2/,"Announcement,ceo,launch,leak,Lin Bin,Mi Pad 2,MIUI 7,official,Pro,Redmi Note 2,Redmi Note 2 Pro,rumour,tenaa,Xiaomi,Xiaomi announcement,Xiaomi Mi Pad 2,Xiaomi Redmi Note 2,xiaomi redmi note 2 pro","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Xiaomi",2015-11-20,"Earlier on, we discussed the potential of  Xiaomi  releasing  a device  that we thought couldn’t be the higher-end version of the Redmi Note 2. Highlighted in our older articles, it didn’t seem to make sense to deploy something totally new to the brand, on a smartphone that could easily be mistaken to be a mid-range device – guess we were wrong, since Lin Bin, the President of the Chinese manufacturer teased two of their upcoming releases, that include the  Redmi Note 2 Pro  and the  Mi Pad 2  on his Weibo social media account. Making rounds earlier on, being shown passing  TENAA’s certification  process, the Redmi Note 2 Pro is a really an odd device. We say so because it seems to include a finger-print sensor and metal-backed built – never seen before on any Xiaomi device. Plastering the aforementioned circular sensor on the back, underneath the LED module for the rear camera, they seem to have adopted the stylings of other Chinese smartphone makers. Since it’s the Pro version of the Redmi Note 2, it won’t have any other distinctive qualities, aside from mentioned above. Having said, it’ll carry a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution screen and underneath its glass panel you’ll likely find an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 clocked to 2GHz. Chances are you’ll find 2GB of RAM inside but rumours have discussed the possibilities of a 3GB RAM option as well; while it’ll have 16GB of native memory on board too. As far as camera optics goes, the same 13-megapixel rear shooter and 5-megapixel front sensor combo will apparently return. Powering the Redmi Note 2 Pro will be a 3060 mAh battery and it’ll run a backdated version of Android, likely 5.0.2 under its  MIUI 7  skin. The bigger device revealed by Lin Bin was the Mi Pad 2 and by the looks of it, it’ll be really thin and have an uncanny resemblance to Apple’s iPads. Without giving away too much, the tablet looks to be fashioned entirely out of metal and feature a very sleek silhouette. It’s thought to carry a quad-core Intel chipset clocked to 2.24GHz. Interestingly, you won’t have to wait much longer since these two devices are slated to make an appearance during a Xiaomi event in China on the 24 th  of November. Still rolling on the excitement of getting our hands on the Redmi Note 2 domestically, we’re hoping that the smartphone maker will release the much-anticipated Mi 5 as well.

Now in its 4th generation, the productivity tablet with Windows 10 has finally arrived in Malaysia with a starting price of RM3,999. Maintaining its sleek tablet form factor with a kickstand, the Surface Pro has a larger 12.3″ display (Surface Pro 3: 12.0″) that pushes a higher 2736×1824 pixels resolution. It still maintains the same footprint of 292.1mm x 201.42mm and Microsoft has managed to make it lighter at 766g and it is thinner too at 8.45mm. Powering the device is Intel’s newest 6th gen Core processors with a variety of processor, RAM and storage options. The base model is no longer a Core i3 but a Core M3 processor that comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For those who demand the ultimate hardware, the Surface Pro 4 also comes with a Core i7 variant with 16GB RAM and 512GB of storage. There’s a pair of stereo speakers and a 5MP camera upfront and the rear gets a 8MP shooter with auto focus. You still get a full sized USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort, all encased in its Magnesium body that comes in Silver. The optional but highly necessary Surface Pro 4 Type Cover keyboard has been massively redesigned for better typing. It gets a chiclet design that claims to be quiet and comfortable to type on. The trackpad is 40% larger and it gets a glass surface that supports 5 point multi touch. 
Meanwhile the new Surface Pen gets a much needed upgrade with 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity and there’s even a eraser at the back. For a better feel and shading, there are also interchangeable pen tips. The Pen is uses a single AAAA battery that’s rated to last a whole year.

Doubling up on functionality as a regular watch and now enabling you to use it as a clock will be much appreciated for those who purchased the smartwatch that starts from SG$ 518 (RM 1,590). Resembling a hockey puck, just a little flatter and tapered at the edges, techcrunch assumes that the dock is fashioned out of plastic, while the usual circular magnetic unit sits inside. Charging can be done in two orientations, the Nightstand mode, which allows the wearable to sit upright and the flat mode, setting your  Apple Watch  onto the coaster. While other after-market options still utilise the charging puck that comes with Apple Watch, the Magnetic Charging Dock has its very own puck built-in. So at least for the price, the dock, only needs a lightning cable plugged into the back to power up. Apple hasn’t trailed away from their own proprietary cables and ports, but  Microsoft  has jumped on the same bandwagon, so the blame should be equally shared. Ridding consumers the convenience of universal plugs and ports, it’ll be harder to find a supported cable while at home or work (other than the one you already have). If you have an Apple Watch, or are thinking of purchasing one, you’ll have to get it in Singapore, the nearest option for Malaysians. Permitted that you’re willing to make the trip, you can purchase it  here . While the magnetic dock that goes for SG$ 118 (RM 360), can also be  found  on the neighbouring country’s online Apple store. [  SOURCE  ]"

These devices are designed for the busy user who needs a phone that won’t run out of juice before they do. The Vibe P1 is the higher end of the duo and will come with a 5.5-inch full-HD IPS display, powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor and 2GB of RAM. Internal storage is rated at 32GB but that’s expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card. The phone also has dual-SIM capabilities and supports 4G LTE. Beneath the Vibe P1’s aluminium body lies its party piece, the enormous 5,000 mAh battery with quick charge support. Security is also beefed up with a fingerprint scanner located underneath the physical home button. Camera wise, the Vibe P1 sports a 13-megapixel rear shooter with PDAF and a dual-LED flash alongside a 5-megapixel fixed focus front camera that is enhanced with a host of beauty features. On the other hand, the lower end Vibe P1m will instead be packaged with a 5-inch 720p HD display with a 1.0GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage running under the hood. The P1m also supports expandable memory in the form of a microSD card up to 32GB. As a little cherry on top, the Vibe P1m will also get a splash-proof nano coating that will protect itself from accidental spills. In the optics department, the Vibe P1m gets a watered down 8-megapixel back + 5-megapixel front camera combo. Like its bigger brother, the Vibe P1m will also support dual-SIM and 4G LTE connectivity. Compared to the massive 5,000 mAh battery in the Vibe P1, this lower end device will ‘only’ have a 4,000 mAh battery, but since it is bundled with a lower 720p display, the smartphone should have no problems lasting you a day. When you do eventually need to charge it, you can have it up and running again in a jiffy with the phone’s Quick Charge 2.0 support. Lenovo states that a full charge for the Vibe P1 from empty would take 2 hours on its own charger. Both devices will come running Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Both smartphones also have the ability to charge other USB powered devices through a USB OTG (On-The-Go) cable. The Vibe devices also have a dedicated power saver switch to extend its battery life should it go low. When toggled on however, the phone brings up a new home screen where you can assign six apps to use during power saver mode. The Vibe P1 will set you back RM1,199 and comes in Platinum and Graphite Grey options, whereas the Vibe P1m will retail for RM649 and have Pearl White and Onyx Black as colour options. If you want to get your hands on these devices, the Vibe P1 will be available in authorised retail stores and  online at Lazada  starting 19 November. The Vibe P1m, on the other hand, will be available exclusively via  online retailer Lazada  from 19 November onwards and will only hit the shelves of authorised local retailers in December. Lazada is offering an RM50 discount and two free gifts with every purchase of the Vibe P1m."

Arif Lee,Maxis talks about what makes its 4G network great,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/19/maxis-talks-about-what-makes-its-4g-network-great/,,,2015-11-19,"Population coverage for 4G LTE has been a  hotly debated topic  of recent times; at least for two telcos –  Digi  and  Maxis . This overdrawn rally between the two has managed to do one thing, get both their customers rattled up. We’re seeing more negative comments from our readers of late, regarding their own experiences on the two networks. When push comes to shove, what we need are clear outlines on how each cellular provider measures themselves, and this is essentially what Maxis talked about earlier today. The parameters set by our telcos determine if they’ve set the bar(s) (figuratively) for their network, high enough to be considered acceptable by consumers. Quoting Maxis reps, 4G LTE is currently growing at an alarming rate and to keep up with that upward trend is a tough task but the green telco believes that the standards it has set is more than adequate enough to live up to their claims. Mentioning briefly that their 4G LTE population coverage is at 62%, placed in 144 locations including state capitals and secondary towns. If you kept track of the current developments, that betters Digi’s numbers by 2%; though there have different levels of signal strength, one being more stringent in their definitions of measurement. Backed by a desire to provide the most consistent experience across 2G, 3G, 4G and beyond, they’ve established standards that maintain their reputation and position as the best telco to provide a high performing internet experience. If you’re new to the whole debate and the jargon that goes along with it, feel free to read the following: How do telcos do about measuring this reading? Well they head to the very edges and see what they can maintain within an area before dropping to a lower speed aka 4G LTE to 3G. So now that we’ve got that out of the way, Maxis has issued (earlier on) that they measure their signal strength at  -98dBm , which on scale, is better than Digi’s  -110dBm  base of measurement. The former goes on to add that if they followed Digi’s standards, it would easily hit 70% of population coverage."

The Mate 8 apparently carries the  Kirin 950  SoC, which could pose a threat to Samsung and Qualcomm’s top performing chips. Embracing the need for higher processing needs, the 950 Kirin processor will boast some highly clocked ARM Cortex cores; the four A72’s will run at 2.3GHz, while the more efficient A53 cores are listed at 1.8GHz. This is based on the big.LITTLE system, that allows an optimised Octa-Core set up, balancing between raw power and power consumption. Along with the aforementioned CPU, it’ll have a Mali-T880MP4 GPU to help out the graphics department. Rumours state that we should expect two models of the smartphone, taking note of two screen resolutions – 1920 x 1080 (FHD) and 2560 x 1440 (QHD) on the same 6-inch screen. Other sources speculate there will be differing internals on differing models. As such, one will supposedly offer 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage – you’d be expected to purchase this device for roughly US$ 517 (RM 2,266). The other model that touts 4GB of RAM and a massive 128GB of internal memory will go for US$ 611 (RM 2,678). Encased under the metal body, there’s a 4,100 mAh battery and it’s bound to have Android 6.0 underneath Huawei’s EMUI 4.0 skin. The invitations have already been detailed here, stating that it’ll be officially announced on the 26 th  of November. Looks like there’s gonna be a whole lot more metal from Huawei from now on.

We  spotted what we thought was the Vibe X3  earlier this year receiving approval from Malaysian and Chinese certification associations earlier this year, but were unable to say for certain. Based on this revealed spec sheet however, it looks like our hunch was right…though not entirely. Lenovo  launched two Vibe X3s, the first is a high spec variant bearing the Vibe X3 badge whereas the second is a watered down version dubbed the Vibe X3 Youth. The high spec Vibe X3 will come with a 5.5-inch 1080×1920 pixel display tucked behind the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It sports a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 processor clocked at 1.5GHz coupled with 3GB of RAM and a choice of either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage. The Vibe X3 also features a big 3,600 mAh battery, which is bigger than the 3,500 mAh that we originally thought. Camera wise, the Vibe X3 features a 21-megapixel Sony rear shooter paired with an 8-megapixel selfie cam. The Vibe X3 Youth, while maintaining the 5.5-inch screen, has considerably watered down specs in a bid to lower cost, featuring an octa-core 1.3GHz MediaTek processor, 2GB of RAM and only 16GB of internal storage. The camera optics have also taken a hit as the Vibe X3 Youth only has a 13-megapixel rear shooter and a 5-megapixel front camera. It also has a smaller battery, rated at 3,400 mAh. Both phones however do share Lenovo’s much  teased  audio system, which features not only two front-facing stereo speakers, but also Hi-fi 3.0 with a total of three Texas Instruments OPA1612 amplifiers, a Cirrus Logic WM8281 codec for noise and echo cancellation to handle the input from the three mics, and a high-end Sabre 9018C2M DAC. Other similarities include a hybrid dual-SIM slot, where users can opt to run two SIM cards or a single SIM card with a microSD card. Both phones also have a fingerprint scanner on rear panel just below the camera, and will support 4G LTE connectivity. Prices start at CNY 1,899 (around RM1,303) for the Vibe X3 Youth, CNY 2,499 (around RM1,714) and CNY 2,999 (around RM2,057) for the 32GB and 64GB variants respectively. Both phones are now available for pre-orders in China, but there is no news on availability outside of China, or what Android version the devices are running. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ,  3 ]"

Those lucky enough to be living near or willing to travel to the China National Convention Centre can get their hands on tickets for the launch – yes, tickets.  Xiaomi  will be selling off 500 of them for just US$ 31, as they usually do for domestic launches; this is due to offsetting cost of the door gift that every ticket holder will receive.

C’mon, the movies have told us at least that much. True enough,  Apple  came up with their “revolutionary”  3D Touch  technology that they claimed required countless hours of research to produce, but ended up being not much more than a gimmick, at least for now with the low amount of apps that actually make use of it. Well, if you want something more revolutionary, the boffins at Qeexo might just have what you need. Carnegie Mellon spin-off Qeexo have come up with a new algorithm that allows smartphones to recognise the angular position of a finger, and are hoping to change the way we interact with our devices. Dubbed the FingerAngle, this algorithm attempts to improve movements and interactions with a touch screen – like pinching or rotating – which require an extra finger to carry out properly. While on most modern smartphones, requiring an extra finger may not seem like that much of an inconvenience as screen real estate is ample. But when you need to perform those same actions on smaller screened devices like wearables, it becomes a little more tricky. FingerAngle though, changes this as it allows those devices to determine if you are rotating your finger, if your finger is tilted upwards, downwards or even swiveled side to side. This software estimates a finger’s 3D angle relative to a screen’s surface by measuring the finger’s pitch and yaw. This then opens up a whole new avenue of possibility for interacting with your device beyond just making it easier for wearables. One prominent possibility is in mobile gaming controls, where currently we have to use on-screen controls or rely on a device’s accelerometer. With FingerAngle, the control possibilities have now completely opened up. FingerAngle’s promotional video clearly shows that there are some kinks to work out, the latency for example, but as this isn’t the final product yet, things are certainly looking good. Of course, this technology is still new and there is no definite timeline to when this software will go live. But as this is purely software, who knows, a manufacturer might pick it up and it could come sooner than you think. [ SOURCE ]"
Alexander Wong,Huawei G8 now available from Maxis with Zerolution program,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/18/huawei-g8-now-available-from-maxis-with-zerolution-program/,"Android,Huawei G8,Huawei G8 Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis Zerolution,MaxisONE Plan","Android,huawei,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field",2015-11-18,"The  Huawei G8  which was launched  alongside  its premium Mate S is now available from Maxis. Retailing at RM1,499 (inclusive of GST), the premium unibody mid-ranger smart phone is offered with its Zerolution program from as low as RM48/month over 24 months period. To recap, Zerolution is an easy device ownership program that lets you upgrade to a new phone after 12 months hassle free. However in terms of the actual postpaid plans, you would need to sign up with their MaxisONE Plan that starts from RM98/month. If you wish to keep the device, all you’ll need to pay is RM48 monthly for 24 months for the device, on top of your monthly subscription. To have the freedom to swap phones after 12 months, you can go for the Zerolution upgrade option at RM44/month extra, which is surprisingly higher than the usual RM30/month upgrade fee quoted for its  previous offering . To upgrade without any further cost, the older device must be returned in pristine order and it is recommended to take up their device protection offering at RM15/month. This covers various damages including screen cracks, water damage and theft.  The Huawei G8 is a 5.5″ Android device with a Full HD screen and it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board it has 32GB of storage which is expandable via microSD. Similar to its high-end models, the G8 gets a fingerprint scanner at the back and for taking pictures, it gets a 13MP main and 5MP front cameras.

That obviously didn’t happen, but now new rumours have surfaced claiming that it will come mid-2016. The 4-inch iPhone, supposedly called the iPhone 6c, was initially rumoured to be powered by an  Apple  A9 CPU, found on the iPhone 6s and  6s Plus , but recent rumours point it towards last year’s A8 chip (found in  iPhone 6  and  6 Plus ) instead. It is also said to feature an improved FaceTimeHD camera, Bluetooth 4.1, and Wi-Fi 802.11ac. This new information was gleaned from Japanese blog Mac Otakara, which has a good track record when it comes to all things Apple. The blog alleges that the new iPhone is apparently already in production and is set to launch in the first half of 2016, which contradicts earlier rumours placing it in the second half, so take it with a grain of salt. This phone looks to be a significant upgrade to the previous iPhone bearing the ‘c’ badge, the  iPhone 5c . No information on the iPhone 6c’s build was found, but if it will continue the trend set by the iPhone 5c, then the body will likely be made out of plastic with an array of colourful options. Earlier, alleged photos of the iPhone 5c were leaked, showing a plastic build and an oval camera LED flash that’s likely a dual-tone colour unit. It wouldn’t be too surprising if Apple decides to continue the ‘c’ badge as sales for the iPhone 5c were actually higher than expected. In Malaysia though, we’re not so sure. How many iPhone 5cs have you seen in Malaysia? Do let us know down below. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  3 ,  IMAGE SOURCE ]"

Now, with the newly announced One M9s, there is another One on the market designed to make purchases for the everyman smartphone buyer all the more difficult. HTC ’s latest One is a variant of its  One M9  flagship device that retains the same 5-inch full-HD display of the phone it’s based off, unlike the bigger  One M9+ . The exterior continues the One M9’s beautiful premium all-metal unibody and design scheme. The One M9s also keeps HTC’s excellent BoomSound front facing speakers, something that will certainly delight those who like to consume media on their smartphones. The phone measures 144.6 x 69.7 x 9.6mm and weighs a touch more than the original One M9 at 158g versus the base model’s 157g. On the inside, HTC swapped out the problematic Snapdragon 810, for an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 chip, but RAM and internal storage were bumped down to 2GB of RAM and only a tiny 16GB of internal storage. Fortunately, the One M9s will have the option to expand its storage up to 2TB via a microSD card. The device is reported to come running Android 5.0 Lollipop with HTC’s Sense on top. The rear camera has been downgraded in terms of megapixels though, dropping from a 20-megapixel affair to a 13-megapixel one. On the bright side, the One M9s’ f/2.0 primary camera will come with optical image stabilisation (OIS), something only available in the  One M9+ Supreme Camera edition . HTC’s UltraPixel camera returns at the front, featuring the same 4-megapixel resolution and an f/2.0 aperture. HTC bundles the  HTC Eye experience  with the One M9s’ cameras, allowing users to use voice controls to take a photo, as well as split screen front and back camera recording. Connectivity options are aplenty, including quad-band 2G/3G and LTE over a multitude of bands. Bluetooth v4.1, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, NFC and GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS and Beidou have also been included. As of this moment, the device can be pre-ordered now in Taiwan for TWD12,900 (around RM1,727). Unfortunately, no word on worldwide availability has been given. Although the HTC One M9 was not officially launched in Malaysia, you can get an imported one from DirectD for RM2,699. As a whole, the One M9s seems to be a light version of its older One M9 brother, with less RAM and internal storage, but, on paper at least, the camera should be better than the One M9 despite the drop in megapixels, because it comes with OIS. Is that a trade-off you are willing to make? Let us know in the comments below. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

Or more specifically,  Cyanogen OS  will be updating the One as OnePlus would not be rolling out  OxygenOS  Marshmallow updates for their first phone because it “isn’t what the product officially ships with”. However, they did mention that they would update the community build of OxygenOS for the One “when time allows”. The OnePlus 2  will also receive its Marshmallow update in Q1 of 2016 and will include the new standard Marshmallow API for the fingerprint sensor. OnePlus have decided against creating their own API despite feedback from its users as they were planning to switch over to the standard Android M implementation soon. No estimated time frame was given on when the Marshmallow updates would reach the  OnePlus X  though, but the Chinese smartphone manufacturer said that they would provide an update on a time frame at a later date.

Giving the Snapdragon 810 a pass recently to avoid any overheating issues, Samsung usually takes advantage of two processor suppliers to meet global demands of their flagships. We’ve addressed the prospect of the two chipset option returning before  here , so this further improves the chances of happening. Seen in a leaked list provided, these were the models along with their corresponding cellular carriers (US telcos): Notably, you’ll be able to spot that the Qualcomm processor is destined for only CDMA networks and carriers, while the Exynos 8890 will make an appearance for GSM and internationally unlocked models (Malaysia included, probably). A reminder to all, given the unofficial mannerism of these leaks, don’t take everything as face value. If Samsung follows their numbering system seen on older models, and this list tallies, well then it could hold water.

Rory Lee,OnePlus 2 USB Type-C cable may damage other devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/16/oneplus-2-usb-type-c-cable-may-damage-other-devices/,,,2015-11-16,"OnePlus  has received some criticism lately, especially when it concerns their “2016 Flagship Killer” the  OnePlus 2 , which many said was killed by this year’s flagships. To add to their woes, their  USB Type-C  cables are now coming under fire for not being spec compliant. Who, you might ask, is attacking OnePlus? Well, some call him the Caped Cable Crusader, others call him the USB Vigilante, but his almost 7,000 followers on Google+ should know him better as Benson Leung. Google employee by day, Amazon cable critic by night, Benson cautioned users who purchased the OnePlus USB Type-C cable against using it with their Chromebook Pixel or the new  Nexus  devices. This was because Benson found that OnePlus’ cable used a 3A identifier resistor instead of the “Default USB Power” resistor, and as a result could cause damage to those devices. He also found that OnePlus’ USB Type-C adapter was also using the wrong identifier resistor, raising concern regarding the actual quality of OnePlus’ accessories. Benson wasn’t deliberately picking on OnePlus though as he had already launched a campaign to test USB Type-C cables off Amazon to see if they met the minimum standards or if they were merely rip-offs. His process consisted of ordering USB Type-C cables from various manufacturers on the site and then testing them, subsequently  posting reviews  on their respective product pages on Amazon. While some did not follow the Release 1.1 USB Type-C specifications, the more common problem it seemed was that many of the cables were using incorrect resistors. While many of the problematic cables were from third party manufacturers, OnePlus’ failure was certainly not expected since their motto was to “Never Settle”. Perhaps they were trying to create cables that only rewarded the faithful. In any case, OnePlus owners don’t have to worry as long as they don’t stick their cables into a device that doesn’t bear the OnePlus logo. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

Now, we get to see the life-saving test as Frenchman Sylvestre’s life is saved when a piece of shrapnel from from a blast that happened only metres away was blocked by his  Samsung Galaxy S6 edge . Caught in one of the two separate explosions that occurred near the Stade de France national stadium during a match between France and Germany, Sylvestre had just hung up the phone when he heard the explosion. Shrapnel, which would have hit his head and probably killed him just moments later, instead left a hole in the back of his Galaxy S6 edge and a shattered screen. The attack on the Stade de France stadium was part of six coordinated acts of terror that struck Paris only a few days ago, leaving  at least 128 dead along with 180 injured . According to a New York Times report, responsibility for the tragic attacks was claimed by the Islamic State and is alleged to be “the first of the storm”. Although miraculous, this is not the first time a smartphone has saved someone’s life as back in 2013 an  HTC EVO 3D  stopped  a bullet aimed at the chest of a petrol station attendant  during an attempted robbery in a petrol station in Orange County, Florida. The bullet went through the man’s pocket but stopped short thanks to his smartphone. HTC , moved by the incident, sent him a “ Glad You’re OK ” care package which included a brand new  HTC One M7  and several accessories including an on-the-go charging device, the device’s official car dock, a HTC laptop bag, and a mug featuring HTC’s “Hipster Troll Carwash” character. Whether  Samsung  will follow in HTC’s footsteps remains to be seen, but it is a little reassuring to know that our smartphones can occasionally save our lives in more ways than one, as long as the phone is in the right place at the right time.

So imagine the public outcry on November 2 when local daily Berita Harian published an exposé on how  Telekom Malaysia Berhad  (TM) was going to incur a surcharge of RM5 to each customer who chooses to receive their monthly bills through the post instead of through TM’s e-billing, come January 2016. The first stage of complaints were about how this was incredibly unfair to those who were subscribed to TM’s telephone services but not their broadband services. Concerns were also raised about those in rural areas who had little or no access to the Internet being forced to pay an extra RM5 just to receive their bill. The elderly who were not tech-savvy enough were also painted as victims in this apparent scheme by TM. The second stage addressed the actual charge incurred by TM as well as the lack of communication of this plan from TM to their customers. RM5 for a piece of paper to be sent by post seems a little too much even if you take everything into consideration. This places a big burden on low income households as well,  as RM5 a month amounts to RM60 a year in surcharges that have to be paid to TM. Many called this blatant profiteering on the part of TM, something that only TM could have the audacity to do because of their monopoly over the market. Upon realising that this could escalate into a PR disaster, TM published a notice of clarification on their website, attempting to give the people an explanation on their situation. In the notice, TM cleared up many of the points touched on above including the actual charge that would be incurred on those who chose to receive their bill by snail mail. According to TM, this was an initiative by the company to move towards a greener and more environmentally friendly billing system where the primary method of billing would be through their e-billing; which could be accessed from their website. TM clarified that the charges would only apply to those who were subscribed to TM’s broadband services, that is,  Streamyx  and  UniFi .  Those who were only subscribed to the telephone service would not be affected and will continue to receive their bill every month, free of charge. However, TM said that they do encourage their customers who were not subscribed to TM’s broadband services to make the digital switch, a choice they claim has been adopted by over 180,000 TM phone customers already. On the other hand, those who were subscribed to the aforementioned broadband services but would prefer to have a physical copy of their bill, along with the e-Bill, could sign-up either by sending an email to  help@tm.com.my , visiting their nearest TMpoint, or calling them at 100. Upon signing up, the telecommunications service provider would incur a surcharge of RM2, not the purported RM5. TM also added that they have begun communicating to their customers since August 2015 through their printed TM bills and have been calling their broadband customers, reminding them to update their preferred email address and telephone number via the abovementioned channels. With the TM e-Bill, customers would be notified of their monthly bill via email within 4 days and by SMS alert within 7 days after their respective bill dates. [ SOURCE ,  2 ,  3 ]"

In the face of this security breach, many tech organisations used their own means to help out by offering their services. The people behind AirBnB, Facebook, Google, Skype, Twitter all jumped into disaster relief mode. Can they along with other organisations continue in the light of similar tragic events around the world? We hope they do. Stemming from Twitter’s Porte Ouverte hashtag, that loosely translates to “Open Door”, Parisians used it to offer a temporary safe house, while those in public spaces could also look for those places and stay up to date on the happenings around the city. Facebook launched their Safety Check function, allowing those in the city a way to notify their loved ones that they were safe, albeit not doing so for other recent disasters that happened in other parts of the world. Users accused the social media site of being desensitised to the daily onslaught in the Middle East (e.g. Ankara and Beirut bombings); as such, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded by saying Facebook will enable this feature across the globe for future. This pivot in the industry could see more tech companies come to the aid of those affected, as their reach is truly global, and are limited only to the gadgets people carry around. Providing shelter, updates on loved ones and means of communication all for the human kind was a kind gesture that should be replicated given the circumstances. Consequently, the more connected the world becomes, the higher likeliness it will bring about an impending threat of terror organisations that camouflage themselves in the same social media networks as regular citizens – as Belgian minister Jan Jambon highlighted; ISIS agents have been driven to utilise the  Play Station 4  network to communicate. Following the tragedy, how will nations react? Technology will be an actor regardless of what they do – meaning that states could possibly adopt new bills and acts that cover surveillance of its citizens. We at SoyaCincau offer our condolences to whoever lost their loved ones during this act of mindless violence and our hearts go out to anyone affected by this tragedy.

Now though, rumour has it that LG have finally decided to go with the flow and follow other major manufacturers with a metal unibody for their upcoming  LG G5 , and we all know what a metal unibody probably means: no removable battery. While initially seeming adamant to stay away from metal bodies, LG finally caved with the  LG V10 , which features a ‘DuraGuard’ stainless steel frame, designed to better protect the phone’s internals on impact. It seems that the success of its competitors and the demand for premium metal builds was too tempting to give up and so recent rumours suggest that we could see a premium feeling metal LG G5 coming next year. However, switching over to a metal unibody would probably mean that LG are ditching the removable back and battery that have been present in most of their recent smartphones, including the  LG G3 , G4, and even the “extra-premium” LG V10. Many of the big players in the smartphone industry have moved away from phones with removable backs and removable batteries, leaving LG as the only relatively well-known smartphone manufacturer to have this feature. Ditching one of their, frankly key, features could cause users who prioritise this feature to now have to look elsewhere, which is something LG would rather avoid, considering their already small market share. Rumours also indicate that we could see it as early as Q1 of 2016,  around the same time  as Samsung’s  Galaxy S7 . Reports suggest that availability of the G5 should come not long after its announcement. Since we’re on the topic of rumours, the G5 was also  rumoured to feature  a brand new 20-megapixel  Sony  camera sensor designed specifically for LG, touting a half inch diagonal sensor. It is also rumoured to come powered by Qualcomm’s latest and greatest processor, likely the  Snapdragon 820 . Although the G5’s build material is based off of one report and at this point could still be up in the air, it doesn’t seem too implausible or unreasonable considering the success of other smartphone giants and their premium flagships.

Clearing up some technicalities, the network provider has verified that they measure their claimed signal strength minimum at -110dBm for 4G LTE; -60dBm is said to be the best (so higher the number is better). In comparison, Maxis uses a  -98dBm  gauge for their minimum signal strength. In these zones, Kesavan Sivabalan, Digi’s Chief Network Office says you will have an uninterrupted 4G LTE experience on their network, for 99.99% of the time. Furthering the conversation, the company has announced LTE-Advanced, leveling at more than 10Mbps 80% of the time; they’ve managed to hit a 22% population coverage so far with this new technology. Again these speeds don’t meet up to standards of the world, as that speed should be easily achievable on a 3G network. Remember that by  definition , 4G LTE (alone) is supposed to reach 100Mbps for downloads, while on the move. Digi and other local telcos have a lot to do before being able to talk about 4G LTE as a whole, if they want to be taken seriously. Using their time wisely, Digi has added that they’ve begun plans to roll-out VoWiFi in 2016, adding on to their earlier announcement about beginning VoLTE next year, as well. Tying it all together, the telco has begun a campaign on Twitter for their users to voice where they want new 4G LTE towers; once it wraps up within a month, the top 10 locations will get a cell tower put up – nope, they aren’t kidding. It’s sad to see the yellow coloured network provider list such low levels for 4G LTE (same goes for their supposed LTE-A). Taking a look at Maxis, who promise that their 4G LTE speeds exceed 15Mbps, at all hours, both indoor and outdoor. It isn’t even a competition,when the latter doesn’t maintain this either but they can manage 5Mbps easily. Of course, the tell of the tale today is about coverage but how we see it is a company just plucking numbers from the air, actions that only earn them bragging rights – without third party verification. We’d like to hear all your thoughts on the subject, as we’ve addressed earlier all this coverage talk should hold no value for customers who suffer coverage outages, even in the Klang Valley. Please wake up telcos, your customers are sick of all this. Coverage should be a right, it should be based in all towns, there shouldn’t be a online “contest” that dictates whether you get a consistent customer experience."

Arif Lee,Early adopters of the iPad Pro are reporting of signs unresponsiveness when plugged in,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/17/early-adopters-of-the-ipad-pro-are-reporting-of-signs-unresponsiveness-when-plugged-in/,"apple,apple ipad,apple ipad pro,charging,charging issues,Hard Reset,iOS 9,iPad Pro,iPad Pro issues,iPad Pro problem","Apple,iOS,iPro,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-17,"Seen on Reddit and Apple’s Support Communities, those who recently picked up Apple’s largest tablet offering, the  iPad Pro  have already started complaining of bad experiences while charging. But these issues usually come along with newly released products anyway – still, should you be worried? The affected users complained that the iPad Pro refuses to boot up after leaving them to charge. After resolving the issue with the force reset method, the battery levels were listed at 100%. More comments pour in sharing the same sentiments but at least Apple is aware of the issue, or at least their Support Communities site is. Their response isn’t much help though, as they suggest to perform a simple factory reset, wiping your device on iTunes. While the other was to try the aforementioned force reset by holding the sleep/wake and home buttons in tandem, till you see the device force resetting. This issue isn’t distinctive to the iPad Pro, as other users are reporting this same problem with other iDevices – iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Could this be a batch issue? Well we hope it can be mediated just by a software update, with iOS 9 being relatively new with on going fixes being released every now and then. Keep in mind that this could be isolated incidents and user error could be involved.  Since Apple hasn’t issued an official statement on the matter, we’re just gonna consider these reports to be rare cases. Head honcho, Tim Cook has already dismissed the prospect of Apple venturing into convergence devices, so maybe for the time being, the iPad Pro will be the only “tablet”-like pursuit in for the foreseeable future. Will the  Surface series  from Microsoft continue in gaining new market shares as Apple falls behind in the  tablet segment ? You tell us. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"
Sponsored,Relive your moments with the Samsung Galaxy Note5,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/13/samsung-galaxy-note-5-moment-of-note/,"5,Android,Galaxy,Galaxy Note5,Galaxy Note5 Malaysia,ISOCELL,Malaysia,Moment of Note,Note,Note5,S Pen,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note5,Samsung Galaxy Note5 Malaysia,samsung malaysia,samsung mobile,smartphone,Sponsored,TouchWiz",Sponsored,2015-11-13,"This is brought to you by the Samsung Galaxy Note5 – How will you capture, create, share your Moment of Note? Life is made out of moments. Moments of joy, sadness, heartbreak and the new experiences that capture the intricacies of what makes life worth living. Who could forget their first visit to a foreign place, the joy of that breathtaking sunset after a hard day’s climb or that first bite into the best burger you’ve ever had? The thing about moments though, is that they are like any other memory, they slip through the fragile grasp of our minds to the powerful tug of time. Moments end up hazy, becoming distant, unable to evoke the same emotions we felt on that day and that’s kind of a bummer because when we’re old and grey, memories of those moments are kind of all we have. Samsung plans to change that though, with the all new  Galaxy Note5 , sporting its amazing 16-megapixel rear shooter, voted best camera by our readers, and the all new S Pen. Capturing moments in real life can be challenging as they are fleeting, often disappearing as quickly as they come. Couple that with lighting that is uncertain at best and you will be in for a hard time making sure that the image will properly reflect what you are seeing. This though, is where the Galaxy Note5’s fast f/1.9 lens comes in. The wide aperture allows a lot of light into the sensor, making sure that your stills stay well exposed even in the dark confines of KL Live. Combine that with Samsung’s auto real-time HDR and you are almost guaranteed a great image no matter how dodgy the lighting. The Galaxy Note5’s camera is also ideal for quick snaps with its “quick launch” feature where a simple double tap on the home button will get you into the dedicated camera app letting you style-snap that fashionista walking down the sidewalk. When you have time to set up that perfect shot, head on into Pro Mode where you will have full access to exposure value (EV), shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and focal distance levels for optimal image capturing. 
With that amazing rear shooter, Samsung also upgraded its front facing camera to a 5-megapixel one that maintains the rear’s HDR feature, bringing selfies to a whole new level. Join your precious moments and never have to worry about poor lighting again. Want to record a video instead? No problem. The Galaxy Note5’s small form factor coupled with the camera’s optical image stabilisation makes it ideal for handheld video recording. The bundled auto-eject S Pen makes video editing a breeze with its pressure sensitive point designed to give precision during editing. With live streaming being all the rage now, the Galaxy Note5’s camera gives users a Live Broadcast option, streaming video from either camera directly to live stream sites like YouTube. As the app is native, it eliminates potential sign-in problems giving the user instant recording. 
Sometimes simply capturing images aren’t enough to capture a moment, so the S Pen lets users personalise their photos and edit on the fly with Screen Write and Photo Editor. Add that little context to an image to make it stand out and just be that little more special. Scribble a memory or even directions on images of popular landmarks so that you will never forget that awesome moment. 
Once that’s done and dusted, share your amazing, personalised photos with the world through social media. Make sure that everyone can experience that moment with you because let’s face it, moments are like a good meal, best enjoyed in great company. In the case that you’d like to take a look at what the creative individuals can do with the Note5, here’s an amazing example: To encourage the capturing of moments and budding creative individuals, Samsung Malaysia will be running their Moment of Note campaign from the 7th of November to the 13th of December where two lucky participants will walk away with a brand new Galaxy Note5. For further enquiries check out their  Instagram page  @SamsungMobileMY. So what are you waiting for? Capture that Moment of Note right now and remember to add the hashtag #momentofnote #GalaxyNote5 and tag @SamsungMobileMY! For more info, visit Samsung’s competition page  here ."

But as more images surface, we’re still doubting if this particular smartphone will actually be the  Redmi Note 2 Pro . Anyhow consumers still have nothing to lose, we’re still getting fresh glimpses of a  Xiaomi  device from China’s regulatory agency,  TENAA . As you can tell, it’ll have a fingerprint sensor on the rear and some metal to go along with it, a first for any Xiaomi device out there ( Mi 4  and  Mi Note  were only metal edged). We would think that Xiaomi wouldn’t kick themselves in the butt, as it seems far-fetched for them to try out something so different on a Redmi – placing it on a flagship device would likely bring more promise and also the Redmi name has attached itself to a moniker so distinct that this would be a 180-degree turn around. Another thing we had noticed was, if this were to be a Redmi device, then why did they remove the red coloured capacitive buttons? Doesn’t make much sense, unless they want to move away from the Redmi platform and make the Xiaomi brand more uniform. Believe what you may, these are all leaks; so there’s no actual word from Xiaomi. Bar none, if it is truly the Redmi Note 2 Pro, it’ll carry the same specs as its predecessor. Translating to a MediaTek Helio X10 processor underneath the 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen. It’s purported to have 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory, while there will be a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear. Moving your way up front, you’ll be greeted by a 5-megaxpiel sensor. Once a realisation comes about, you’ll see that handing the smartphone a metal build means that there won’t be any chances of removing the 3060 mAh battery inside. If it stands as it is, the phone will have a selling price of US$ 172 (RM 753) – that’s if it really is another Redmi product. We apologise for the cynicism but things aren’t adding up on our end. More so since Xiaomi just brought the Redmi Note 2 to Malaysia (and other emerging markets). Rumours, maintain their bad rep; at least for this moment of time. We’ll have to wait to see what Xiaomi has to say about all this, which they likely won’t, since it fuels interest in the brand. One has to hand it to them, now everyone is merely guessing what their next move is and this witch-hunt is getting quite fun. Feel free to add to the rumours with your own analysis of all this and at the same time, check out the post about how the Xiaomi “Gemini” was spotted with a Snapdragon 820 processor  here .

Rory Lee,MDeC teams up with Google to groom Malaysian YouTubers,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/13/mdec-teams-up-with-google-to-groom-malaysian-youtubers/,"Content Creator,DiDi & Friends,google,Google+ Malaysia,Grim Film,Jared Lee,MDEC,MSC Malaysia,Multimedia Development Corporation,Sajith Sivanandan,The Grim Film,Video,youtube,YouTube Malaysia,Youtube videos",Video,2015-11-13,"YouTubing has to be one of the most hyped professions to have hit the modern age, with so many people trying to get a slice of the video-sharing website’s one billion and up monthly audience. Even children have switched ambitions from wanting to be chefs or doctors to  becoming famous ‘YouTubers ’. Yes, apparently it’s a noun now. Well, if your ambition was to be Malaysia’s very own PewDiePie or follow in the footsteps of the boys at Wong Fu Productions, there’s good news. The  Multimedia Development Corporation  (MDeC) has roped in international search engine and verb,  Google , to empower local content creators on the web. Made for  YouTube  is a programme that has been running for the past year designed to nurture and highlight Malaysian YouTube content creators. Over 20 participants handpicked from from a pool of MSC Malaysia status companies and local YouTubers by Google and MDeC, with the main criteria being that they have to possess their own original Intellectual Property (IP).  The participants were then groomed and provided with coaching sessions, funding development, growth and strategic advice, dedicated manpower via direct contact with the YouTube Account Manager, and production facilities such as the Malaysia Animation Creative Content Centre (MAC3). If managed and executed properly, this could be an enormous opportunity for local content creators to tap into YouTube’s considerable user base and share their content with a global audience. The video-sharing website’s growth can’t be denied in Malaysia as it sees an annual Malaysian watch-time growth of 60%, the bulk of which come from user’s mobile devices. With a market growth of this size, many locals have of course jumped on the YouTubing bandwagon where the number of videos uploaded to YouTube by Malaysians are increasing by 40% each year. Unfortunately, despite the creative content industry’s estimated value to be worth RM7 billion, only 15% of content is local. “Over a billion people visit YouTube every month, globally, for news, information and of course entertainment,” said Google Malaysia, Vietnam Philippines and New Emerging Markets managing director Sajith Sivanandan. “That is a huge audience waiting to be tapped into and we hope that Malaysian content creators will be in the thick of it. “Consumer friendly platforms like YouTube as well as an entire open web are places where Malaysians can and should fully explore their creative expression and perhaps – and this is very critical to us – even turn their passions into businesses,” he added. Addressing concerns that there are very few successful content creators in Malaysia despite this programme’s efforts, Sivanandan said that this was simply not the case. He reasons that YouTube is incredibly targeted and so conventional means of popularity should not be used to determine success. He adds that just because something is not relevant to one individual, it does not mean it is not relevant to everyone else. Although this programme empowers content creators through providing them with the necessary tools they need, it is the knowledge aspect of this programme that insurmountably valuable. The programme teaches these aspiring content creators how to best use the tools and resources they have such as Google Analytics as well as the new Malaysia Content Pitching Centre. Through this programme, local YouTubers such as  The Grim Film  and  DiDi & Friends: Children Songs  have achieved much success with their most viewed videos reaching over  2 million views  and  5.8 million views  respectively. “Our collaboration with Google aims to increase the reach, capability and competency of Malaysia’s creative industry by helping home-grown content creators produce, monetise and commercialise world-class content on the YouTube platform,” said MDeC CEO Dato’ Yasmin Mahmood. “This partnership is very much aligned with our aim of positioning Malaysia as a regional hub for creative content,” she added. The Grim Film’s Jared Lee, who was present at a Made for YouTube gathering organised by Google and MDeC in the Google Malaysia headquarters this afternoon, highlights another important benefit of success in YouTubing, and that is digital agency.  “I think these days brands start to treat YouTubers as a creative agency as well. So they will call us and say, ‘so, you have views, what do you think you can do for our brand?’,” he said, adding that the YouTubers would then come up with content for the brand. “One of the scariest things that they say to us though is ‘make me a viral video’,” he laughs. In any case, on the surface, this initiative looks like a good move to groom local YouTube talents and as a whole, improve the quality of Malaysia’s creative content. Although the first phase of this programme was only open to content creators that were hand picked by Google and MDeC, there is no telling what possibilities could come up in the future if this programme gets more traction."

Whether you’re on the go with your device needing a quick fix or simply forgetting to charge it the day before. Hence the existence of quick-charge, the wonderful piece of innovation that gets your smartphones recharged at a fast-pace; though it isn’t without some detrimental effects to the lifespan of your battery. Huawei  hopes to take it a step further by lacing these lithium ion batteries with graphite, around the anodes – shown in a video below, it’ll blow any derivative of fast-charging by a mile at no expense of your battery’s lifespan. Let’s put this in perspective,  Qualcomm  claims that its  Quick Charge 3.0  can get a smartphone from 0 to 80% in just 35 minutes – Huawei’s? It’ll get a 3,000 mAh battery from 0 to 48% in just 5 minutes. Imagine plugging your phone in and hitting the showers, coming back and getting at least half of your battery life back. During the same Battery Symposium in Japan, they also showed a 600 mAh battery hit 68% after being dead in just 120 seconds, yes guys in 2 minutes. In its early stages, the charging block is comparable to the size of an actual brick, so it won’t be too pleasant to lug around but this shows some great promise, if they manage to minimise the size. There’s no timeline as to when it’ll hit mass consumers, but since its their own brainchild, they might only reserve it for their own devices. Inlays into battery advancements have been slow, at least in terms of breakthroughs, but it’s nice to see all the research is being put to good use. At least now, we have more glimmers of hope for our constant thirst for power (literally). [  VIA ,  2  ]"

Images of a metal backed device had made rounds earlier in the  October , it was reported to be a higher-end Redmi Note 2 Pro but we think it might be the  Mi 5  in disguise after all. Leading many to predict that this will be Xiaomi’s first attempt at such a high-end device; in terms of the metal design and beastly specs. We’ve seen Chinese manufacturers,  Huawei , take it a step further recently, so maybe Xiaomi is ready to join the party. We’re not implying that the  Mi 4 ,  Mi 4c  and  Mi Note  aren’t worthy but this is really a step in the right direction for the Beijing based corporation. Posted with the MSM8996 model number (aka the Snapdragon 820), this “Gemini” will also take advantage of the Adreno 530 GPU on the same processor board. Giving you a brief introduction of the Snapdragon 820 chipset’s credentials; Qualcomm promises that it’ll draw 30% less power than the 820, while graphics will get a 40% bump up, thanks to the Adreno 530 GPU. You can read on about the latest Qualcomm processor  here . Nailing the benchmarks with a single-core score of 2140 and multi-core score of 4762, how does it compare to the rest? Looking at single-core performance, the head of the pack is the  iPhone 6s Plus  with a 2,500 mark. While for the multi-core the  Galaxy S6  sits high with a 5,000 score. Some have dutifully pointed out that the clocked speeds are under-clocked, only at 1.6GHz so the full potential of the device is still in the wind. This is also just a prototype, not a working model, so we’re sure it’ll perform better once it’s official revealed. Another user  TyrionLannister , mentions that “Geekbench always prints the lower clock speed. Even the 7420 posts 1.5GHz while the big cores are 2.1GHz”. Good scores or bad scores, at least this listing shows that Xiaomi is working on a smartphone with the Snapdragon 820 inside. They’re no longer relying on lesser worthy chips and skipping the Snapdragon 810 all-together could finally pay off for them. We assure everyone that once more information comes to light, we’ll keep you posted, as we’re just as excited as you guys to hear this news.

Announced  during IFA 2015, the Gear S2 is Samsung’s first round smart watch that offers a more contemporary style along with a fresh new interface. There are 2 Gear S2 variants on offer. The modern looking Gear S2 is priced at RM1,399 while the timeless design Gear S2 Classic is going for RM1,599. Both can be pre-ordered from 20th to 23rd November with an extra 20% discount. On top of that, Samsung Malaysia is also bundling an extra wireless charging dock worth RM169. Note that this special offer is limited to the first 500 customers only.  The Gear S2 is officially going on sale in Malaysia on the 27th November. To refresh on the specs, both Gear S2 models come with a 1.2″ Circular Super AMOLED screen that pushes 360×360 resolution. It runs on Tizen OS like its former Gear series and keeping the watch ticking is a dual-core 1.0GHz processor with 512MB of RAM. For storage, the Gear S2 has 4GB of storage which can be used to store offline music. Connectivity wise, the Gear S2 pairs with your smart phone via Bluetooth 4.1 and it also gets NFC and WiFi 802.11n support. If your smart phone isn’t in range, it is able to work independently through WiFi. There’s a mic for voice control, a built-in heart rate sensor, while the front bezel also doubles up as a rotating ring for navigation and scrolling. Having a circular screen, the user experience has been redesigned from the ground up with rotary like interface. Available in either Dark Grey or White (with Silver case), the Gear S2 comes with a proprietary rubber strap that’s replaceable and you’ll get 2 sets for different wrist sizes. For the Gear S2 classic, a genuine leather band is included out of the box and it is replaceable with any traditional strap that uses a standard 20mm pin. Both versions have dust and water resistance rated at IP68, but do note that the leather strap for the Classic version isn’t designed to withstand wet conditions. Unlike the previous Gear S, the current Gear S2 and Gear S2 Classic doesn’t support voice call. That’s reserved for the 3G version which isn’t available for our market. To place your pre-order, head over to Samsung Malaysia’s  Gear S2 Pre-order  page on the 20th November."
Rory Lee,Pictures of Samsung’s follow up to the Galaxy A3 and Galaxy A5 leaked,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/11/pictures-of-samsungs-follow-up-to-the-galaxy-a3-and-galaxy-a5-leaked/,"Android,leak,rumour,rumourmill,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A3,Samsung Galaxy A3 2016,Samsung Galaxy A5,Samsung Galaxy A5 2016,smart phone,smartphone","Android,Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-11-11,"Pictures of the rumoured successor to  Samsung ’s  Galaxy A3  and  Galaxy A5  have been leaked, showcasing the phone’s front, rear, and bottom physical features. Shots of the phones’ “About device” screen has also been shown, indicating that the new phones would be named the Galaxy A3 (2016) and the Galaxy A5 (2016). The introduction of the Galaxy A duo really signaled the South Korean manufacturer’s intention to bring a more premium construction to its midrange lineup. From what we can tell, the new phones seem to have a design similar to Samsung’s flagships, the  Galaxy Note5  and the  Galaxy S6 . Both models sport a glass like material for the front and back panels with a metal frame running between them around the phone. The speaker grilles are located at the bottom of the phone along with a headphone jack, Micro-USB port and a microphone. Around the back, both phones sport a rear camera in the top middle section of the back panel along with an LED flash right beside it. Although phone specifications were not revealed at this point in time, previous performance leaks indicate that the Galaxy A3 (2016) will feature a 4.7-inch HD (720×1280 pixels) display, a slight bump up from the existing model, and will have an Exynos 7580 quad-core processor, clocked at 1.5GHz, paired with 1.5GB of RAM under the hood. In a separate leak,  NDTV Gadgets 360 reports  that the Galaxy A5 (2016) is rumoured to feature a 5.2-inch full-HD display, which is also a slight increase in size compared to the existing model. Internals include Samsung’s octa-core Exynos 7 processor clocked at 1.6GHz paired with an ARM Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Both phones share a 16GB internal storage and are rumoured to run on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, but we do hope that by the time the phones are launched they would be running on Android M instead. What’s peculiar here though is that the leaked specifications for the Galaxy A3 (2016)’s camera puts it at 13 megapixels for the rear shooter and 5 megapixels for the front facing camera, which is better than the Galaxy A5 (2016)’s purported 12-megapixel rear camera and 4.7-megapixel front camera. That said, the Galaxy A5’s camera could have a newer sensor with a larger pixel size which can result in better photos. The current Galaxy A3 is equipped with an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front facing camera versus the Galaxy A5’s 13-megapixel primary and 5-megapixel secondary shooter. What do you think of these leaks? Let us know in the comment section below. [ SOURCE ,  2 ]"

Renders of what looks to be BlackBerry’s second  Android  device have found their way on the Internet and they are interesting, to say the least. The renders indicate that the BlackBerry Vienna will have an always-present physical QWERTY keyboard, a long rectangular screen and and three physical Android buttons seated under it. The bezels around the screen appear to be quite large, though it does look like the screen’s glass extends to the sides of the phone as well. Missing the premium  BlackBerry Priv ’s dual edge display indicates that this could likely be a more budget friendly phone than the Priv. The smartphone looks to come in four different colours and a rough textured body. BlackBerry’s standard four button combo adorns the chamfered sides of the Vienna and if they are anything like the Priv’s then the buttons would be a volume up, volume down, and a quick mute button. A front and rear camera combo can also be seen in the photos. The rear camera does not appear to have any visible hump but there what looks like a single LED flash nestled right next to it.  Its design bears some resemblance to the  BlackBerry Passport , albeit with a longer screen. Should this end up being the rumoured Android-powered Passport, it could then indicate that overall sales of the Priv are going well since BlackBerry said that they would only release the  “Passport 2” if the Priv performed well . On Amazon at least, sales are indeed very positive as the Priv was sold out within hours of its United States official release. The BlackBerry Priv marked the Waterloo-based company’s big move away from its proprietary OS into Google’s sandbox. Many called this move a Hail Mary attempt though  CEO John Chen  said that a ‘Hail Mary’ was not quite the right term as the Priv had been in the works for some time already. BlackBerry was always known for its emphasis on safety and productivity, which was something that was built into the BlackBerry OS, and something that its users appreciated. However, the company simply could not keep up with the number of apps present on systems such as Android and iOS. As a result, BlackBerry’s market share dwindled to about  0.3% in Q2 of 2015 . Another Android device so soon would indicate that the company could be abandoning  BlackBerry 10  entirely, at least for the time being. But this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise as CEO John Chen had said before that their choice of OS would be  dictated by “business choices” . With the Priv’s arrival in Malaysia  rumoured to be just around the corner , the Vienna could be just the sequel it needs, especially if it was more affordable. Is this enough to regain BlackBerry’s lost user base though? [ SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"
Rory Lee,Your iPad Pro accessory buying just got a little more complicated with the Logitech CREATE Keyboard,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/12/your-ipad-pro-accessory-buying-just-got-a-little-more-complicated-with-the-logitech-create-keyboard/,"accessories,accessory,apple,apple ipad pro,iOS,iPad,iPad Pro,Logi CREATE Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector,Logitech,Logitech CREATE Keyboard,MacBook,Smart Keyboard","Apple,iOS,iPad,Mobile Accessories",2015-11-12,"If you were on the fence about purchasing  Apple ‘s new Smart Keyboard for your  iPad Pro , then perhaps  Logitech  can help you with that. Designed in collaboration with Apple under Logitech’s CREATE banner, comes the Logi CREATE Backlit Keyboard Case with Smart Connector. Another little perk is that it makes your iPad Pro look like a  MacBook . As the name suggests, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard utilises the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector, like Apple’s own Smart Keyboard, to connect to the iPad Pro, hence removing all the fuss associated with pairing accessories. It also draws power from the iPad Pro so there will be no need to charge the keyboard. The outer shell of the Logitech CREATE Keyboard is made of a woven fabric while the inside is constructed out of aluminium, which keeps it in the same design theme as Apple’s other products. The keyboard features a fairly standard layout, similar to that of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, only it has an array of iPad Pro specific shortcut keys. Apple’s Smart Keyboard utilises a seamless key system where there is no gap between the keys, preventing dust and other small particles from falling between them. The keys on the Smart Keyboard also do not have any conventional mechanisms in them, opting instead to use the keyboard fabric’s natural “spring-like tension”. On the other hand, Logitech employs a much more traditional keyboard layout with individual chiclet keys similar to those on the  MacBook Pro  and  Macbook Air . The most painfully obvious difference is that unlike Apple’s Smart Keyboard, Logitech’s keyboard is fully backlit, which may end up being the deciding factor for many. Available in three different colours, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard has a colour to match each one that the iPad Pro is available in, blue for the silver version, black for Space Grey and red for the gold iPad Pro. The Verge reports  that Logitech’s alternative is a little bulkier when compared with Apple’s own keyboard but has added functionality with an entire row of iPad shortcut keys while also being able to double as a full case. A trade off they were willing to make. Coming in at US$149 (around RM 649) the Logitech CREATE Keyboard is also cheaper than the Smart Keyboard which is priced at RM799. However, both of them are still pricier than Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 Type Cover which is  priced at RM529 . To learn more about the pricing options for the iPad Pro and its accessories, head on over  here . Providing more functionality for a lower price, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard does seem to be a good deal, assuming you are comfortable dealing with the extra bulk. Unfortunately, the Logitech CREATE Keyboard is currently not available for purchase in the Apple Malaysia store for the time being, but we will keep you updated if it does become available.   [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"
Arif Lee,Sightings of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge firmware points to an early arrival of the duo,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/11/sightings-of-samsungs-galaxy-s7-and-s7-edge-firmware-points-to-an-early-arrival-of-the-duo/,"edge,Exynos 8890,flagship,Galaxy,Galaxy S7,Galaxy S7 edge,MWC,MWC 2016,S7,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 edge,Snapdragon 820","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-11-11,"September was a hot month for the Korean manufacturer, releasing two devices in the form of the  Galaxy Note5  and the  Galaxy S6 edge+ . With these two out and about, they can finally refocus efforts (as if they weren’t already) on the 7 th  generation flagships. What could this mean for the official release(s) of the  Galaxy S7  and the  Galaxy S7 edge ? Trusting leaked information on their firmware codenames, it might mean a release earlier than usual. Looking at industry trends, Samsung has recently fast-tracked their products by a month or so – e.g. the release of Samsung’s Galaxy Note5, in contrast to its predecessor. Accordingly, the unreleased device(s) should lead to better processors, though will it be the  Exynos  8890, the  Snapdragon 820  or both? We’ve seen these Korean devices be outfitted with two different chipsets before; mainly specific to regions but they skipped it for two generations, when the two options were last seen on the Galaxy Note4. A revival would be in order, as Qualcomm has stepped their game back to norm with the Snapdragon 820 (that was released today). Riding other waves, Samsung might also consider lodging a bigger screen, enticing folks who’d prefer more screen real-estate. There are also some (crazy) reports going around stating that the company will launch two different screen variants of the Galaxy S7 edge at the same time – at this time, it doesn’t make sense for Samsung to release the larger version, once you consider the S6 edge+ has only been around for a while. We’ve also discussed the potential for the latest Samsung offerings to be equip with the class-leading USB Type-C, a 3D Touch/Pressure Sensitive display and a 20-megapixel ISOCELL sensor as well. You can revisit our post about the assumed spec-sheet  here . Spotted as G930FXXU0AOK6 and G935FXXU0AOK6, these are the latest leaks that support the theory that there will be two different versions of the Galaxy S7 (one regular, and the other a dual edged display). It is purported that they will begin the developmental stages for the software, from this month onwards. In the past the current line-up used SM-G920 and SM-G925 as internal codenames, so the G930 and G935 wouldn’t surprise anyone to be anything other than their successors. Phonearena has highlighted that 12 months ago, the Galaxy S6’s final firmware didn’t begin till December, so implications can be made that the Galaxy S7 line should be out just in time for MWC 2016, in February. What do you think? Should Samsung maintain their delivery times of their 4 main flagships? And are you excited by hearing this news? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Built using 14nm FinFET processor technology, it’ll be an all-in-one chip; meaning to say that the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture CPU will be joined by a LTE Rel-12 Cat.12/13 modem. Slated to be the most premium processor amongst the Exynos series when it finally hits devices (like the  Galaxy S7  maybe), it’ll allow smartphones to support theoretical download speeds as far up as 600Mbps, while uploads will go up to 150Mbps when taking LTE technology into account. When compared to the existing  Exynos 7420 , Samsung promises that the latest addition to the family will bring about 30% of performance improvements and 10% of power efficiency. As is, smartphones are becoming “too” powerful, surpassing the needs of a regular user, but hey, we’re not complaining. Qualcomm  managed to one-up their Korean competitor, as they officially announced the  Snapdragon 820  a day earlier. If you’re interested in the possible alternative chipset that might make its way in the Galaxy S7 series, you can read up on that  here . This could be a very blatant hint that the Korean manufacturer is ready for the upcoming year, with the prospect of releasing its new flagships during MWC 2016; coincidentally the Exynos 8890 will start assembling on production lines in late 2015 – so make your own deductions based on that. As the end of the year nears, we’re bound to get more leaks of how this new processor performs inside an actual device, we’ll keep you updated when the time arrives.

Bits of pieces of information on Samsung’s upcoming flagship, the  Galaxy S7  have started to  trickle in  and some are speculating that the Galaxy S7 might arrive sooner than usual. The Galaxy Note5 for instance was launched a month earlier to give themselves an early head start before the iPhone 6s/6s Plus have gotten some serious attention. For the next Galaxy, will Samsung make a grand showing at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona? According to tipster, nothing has changed for the upcoming Galaxy S7. The Korean smart phone maker isn’t going to bring its launch earlier and there’s no reason for them to rush since the Galaxy Note5 is still a worthy flag bearer for now. So if you’re anticipating for their compact flagship, you should look out for 21st February – a day before MWC 2016 commences.  In terms of availability, do expect Samsung to roll out their flagships in about a month’s time. The Galaxy S6 was  officially announced  on 2nd March and followed closely with a  Malaysian launch  on 2nd April. If all goes well, it’s safe to assume that we could be having the Galaxy S7 on our shores by end March or early April.  In terms of specs, the new Galaxy is speculated to offer multiple processor variants of either an  Exynos 8890 processor  or a  Qualcomm Snapdragon 820  unit. Like the past 2 launches, we expect Samsung to launch both S7 and a S7 “edge” version as revealed by  early firmware releases . Apart from having better hardware, the new Galaxy could feature a future-proof USB Type C and possibly a pressure sensitive display for added user interaction. MWC 2016 is just 3 months away, so expect more leaks to surface ahead of its official release. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Windows 10 Mobile  will be on it out of the box but will this device be capable of putting the Windows OS back in the hearts and minds of smartphone users? It hasn’t even hit stores in the States, so let’s not be too impatient; the Redmond-based company already mentions a 20 th  of November release, in their native US market. But if the  Surface Pro 4  were to arrive in Malaysia on the 19 th , we don’t think they’ll have one amazing gala, rather they’d build up anticipation of their devices gradually. Skimming through SIRIM, if you’d search for the model number RM-1116, the following information would be available to you: Saving you the trouble of digging through the spec-sheet, here’s what to expect from the Lumia 950 XL; for starters, it’ll carry a QHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED 5.7-inch ClearBlack display, while on top you’ll find Gorilla Glass 4 to protect it from abrasions. Running all processes, is a 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, together with 3GB of RAM and 32GBs of on-board memory. If that doesn’t sit well with you, there’s a microSD slot for expandability up to 200GB – but believe us, if you’re going to be shooting 4K content, it’ll be a life saver. The PureView camera is back and this time it’s a 20-megapixel f/1.9 lens on the rear, equip with triple-LED RGB flash for less harsh illumination of your photos. You’ll find optical image stabilisation on board as well, that will come in handy taking quick shots with the dedicated camera button. When recording those 4K videos, you’ll be able to shoot up to 30fps and for audio quality, it’ll be supported by the 4 microphones using Lumia’s Rich Recording technology. Selfies on the other hand, will be taken with a 5-megapixel wide angle f/2.4 shooter, which allows Full HD video recording for video calls. To top it all off, it comes with a 3,340mAh battery and will give you Qi Wireless charging, if you prefer the no cable route. We’d like to think that you might stick with the old-school method since it’ll get you 0% to 50% in half an hour, through the USB Type-C port. It also ticks all the boxes for internal connectivity options – 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. From our perspective, Malaysians should expect our local Microsoft to release the two Lumia devices concurrently, after the Surface Pro 4 launch. Based on currency conversions you should expect the Lumia 950 XL to cost roughly RM 2,813 but obviously, no official prices have been announced. We’ll keep you updated once we get official news from the manufacturer, regarding the Lumia devices. Till then, feel free to let us know your thoughts about how the Windows mobile platform is progressing/digressing in the comments below. A big thank you to Twitter user  @Syazx83  for the tip."

Unique to  Samsung ,  Tizen OS  wearables were never able to interact with other devices outside the Samsung name. Luckily Korea’s finest have smartened up this time and the  Gear S2  has the ability to communicate with other Android smartphones. They left  iOS  out, at least until September, when they suggested that they might consider opening it up. Since the beginning of Autumn, no follow-up came from Samsung but today, as reported by a Vietnamese blog, the Gear S2 will allow pairing and working functionality with iOS by the end of the year. They go to say that the first Gear S2 app will also be made available on the App Store; so setting up and customising your Gear S2, will be a breeze. No restrictions will be made for iOS users, except they won’t be able to access Samsung Pay – since, well, they aren’t using a Samsung. Those still harping on about whether to get the Apple Watch or the Gear S2 might have more reasons to think about switching up their device options slightly, if they were to already have an iPhone. This obviously is a mere rumour, so let’s wait for Samsung to release official information first, before going out and buying your Gear S2. Well, for the most part, we hope  Apple  doesn’t pull a Pebble, and  remove  the app from their App Store, once it goes live. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

It’s no surprise that the company managed to rake in so much business, as for the longest time, the brand has always offered great products at great prices. And with new iterations of their Redmi Note and  Mi Band  line, everything was coordinated quite timely.

Building a long list of prophetic calls over his time at KGI Securities, he is a force to be reckoned with – the Nostradamus of  Apple , minus the ambiguity. Apparently, when concerning the likeliness of  iPhones  carrying  AMOLED  screens, he’s calling it a bluff, at least until 2019 comes around. Casually shooting down  speculation  that the manufacturer would tie up with their (competitor)  Samsung  (yet again), for AMOLED screens; he says that they’ll stick to LCDs for the time being. Basing his analysis on Foxconn’s recent deal to build LTPS TFT-LCDs in Zhengzhou and a company’s insights that LCDs will still be around for 3 years at minimum, it seems like a bad idea for Apple to forgo such investments. It’ll be clearly nonsensical to pursue OLEDs, if Apple’s deal means that Foxconn were to partner to the government of Henan for the aforementioned project. Kuo’s reputation exceeds his name but if the company were to consider OLEDs, they’d see a great improvement in battery life, while they’ve mediated that issue quite well with how efficient  iOS  runs; while still having lower capacity batteries compared to their competitors. There’s a chance that you would’ve noticed AMOLEDs on their other product, the  Apple Watch . Talking about OLEDs and its ability to deliver deeper “true”black pixels, the Chief Design Officer, Jony Ive discussed that in its current state, iPhone’s screen technology is an old-tune. It must mean something, if the guy designing all the products in your company were to say that, so maybe, just maybe, Apple might budge, given the right factors. Here’s the transcript of Jonathan’s conversation in the interview: You can explore the whole LCD/LED vs OLED issue  here .

Rory Lee,Google Maps offline hopes to eliminate ‘screenshot jujitsu’,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/11/google-maps-offline-hopes-to-eliminate-screenshot-jujitsu/,"Android,apple,google,Google I/O,Google Maps,Google Maps Malaysia,google maps offline navigation,GPS,GPS Malaysia,Malaysia,Malaysia Navigation,Maps,Maps Malaysia,mobile apps,navigation,Offline,offline navigation,smart phone,smartphone","Android,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices",2015-11-11,"Announced during the Google I/O in May earlier this year , Google has finally begun the gradual rollout of its new Google Maps offline navigation feature. Users can expect to see this feature in the latest version of the Google Maps app which will allow users to save locations, search, and access the app’s turn-by-turn navigation offline. As good as all of this sounds, there is a slight catch though. This new feature will only be available now on Android devices with availability on iOS devices listed as “coming soon” though no definite date was provided. Although relatively unsurprising, this feature will make owning an Android device versus an iOS one that much sweeter, at least for the time being. Previously, saved offline maps could only be viewed, the new Google Maps app will allow you to get turn-by-turn driving instructions, search for specific locations, and find information about places like operating hours, contact information or ratings. Offline navigation is simple enough to access as users only need search for a city, country or location and then tell the app to save the selected area. Areas can be saved by tapping “Download” on the resulting place sheet or by going to “Offline Areas” in the Google Maps menu and then tapping the “+” button. According to Google, the offline feature will not only benefit users navigating in areas without connectivity but also for users navigating between locations with spotty service, like in underground carparks or country roads. The app will automatically detect these areas and switch between online and offline mode to compensate for the lack of connectivity. Google’s product manager told the BBC  that they have been working on all of these features for two to three years already as Google Maps happened to be really slow or completely unusable in many scenarios due to limited connectivity. She added that with this, users will not have to resort to “all that screenshot jujitsu” before they leave on a journey for fear of loss of access during their journey. Saved offline maps will update automatically once every 15 days as long as the device is plugged into a charger and connected to WiFi unless the user overrides these settings. Despite the ability to access information, like ratings, about specific locations being listed as one of the new features’ capabilities, the  BBC reports  that reviews people have posted about restaurants and other businesses are not shown, and neither are user-generated photos. There is a silver lining to this limitation though as Google promises that they will be introducing even more offline features over time.  While availability in Malaysia was not specifically mentioned,  Forbes has indicated  that this feature will be work with any area in the world. Should this new feature arrive on our shores, it could really give existing popular navigation apps a run for their money. [ SOURCE ]"
Arif Lee,How safe is your mobile operating system?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/11/how-safe-is-your-mobile-operating-system/,"Android,Android M,App Store,apple,apple app store,google,Google Play Store,HTC,infection,iOS,iPhone virus,LG,Mac virus,malware,mobile,mobile operating system,Nexus,operating system,OS X,Play Store,Samsung,spyware,Trojan,Virus","Android,Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-11,"Vulnerabilities of mobile OS’ are now a casual affair, for the frequencies of malware related issues have risen to alarming heights. When analysing which platform is safer, two security firms have looked at how secure the  Android  and  iOS  platforms are. The results may surprise you, but how worried should we be? And what cautionary steps should be taken? Users that dabble in third-party app stores (should) know what they’re doing, especially when it concerns workarounds and an unauthorised market place for apps. Bountiful in choices in countries like China and Russia, some of these apps are obviously laden with hidden malware and that’s where the official sources,  Google Play Store  and the  Apple App Store , vets them. Conventional thought has always made Apple the king when it comes to supplying the most secure operating system ( OS X  or iOS). Nevertheless, a new study provides some surprising insights that iOS is 4% more prone to vulnerable attacks compared to Android. The breakdown of the numbers is as listed below: Partly due to the amazing growth of the mobile ecosystem that sees nearly 1.5 million apps between the two platforms and multiple billions of downloads, this screams to be the best place for hackers to have some fun – at our expense. Extending way beyond instant messaging and social media, apps have evolved to include these sectors; banking and medicine, just to name a few. Dedicated detection in-built into apps would be one of the most promising course of action for smartphone vendors. It doesn’t help either that mobile OS’ run in a sandbox environment. To simplify what that means, you’re letting an application do what it needs to, in a secure setting. There are restrictions, so for example if you were to use an anti-spyware/malware app on your device, it can only do so much – now restricted by the operating system instead of the other way around. For a more thorough explanation head on over  here . Always ensure that the apps you download are from reputable developers, especially if you’re on an Android device. In a sense, iOS is more tightly overseen when giving power to developers, so that’s a smaller sandbox and vetting them before going live on the App Store. While  Google  also has its own process, it isn’t as stringent as  Apple  – case and point, no validity for Play Store apps. It’s understandable that with a fairly open-sourced platform, Android will have its trade-offs when it concerns pushing out security updates but hopefully  Android M  solves this. OEMs have jumped on the idea of providing monthly security updates, as far as  Samsung ,  LG  and  HTC  is concerned. The full report from Checkmarx can be found  here . Till another malware attack arrives, keep your personal data safe everyone!

Although a steady trickle of the processor’s specifications have been divulged by Qualcomm over the past few months, this is the Snapdragon 820’s actual “official” launch. Now that all it’s specs have been released, will it be the successor everyone has been waiting for? The Snapdragon 820 will be made up of the new 14nm quad-core custom 64-bit Qualcomm Kryo CPU which can be clocked up to 2.2 GHz, a new Adreno 530 GPU which supports OpenGL ES 3.1+ and OpenCL 2.0 Full, the Hexagon 680 DSP which enables the CPU to offload more tasks for fast processor using less power, the new X12 LTE modem that boasts upload speeds of up to three times faster and 33% faster download speeds compared to the X10 LTE, along with several other upgraded components. Qualcomm claims that the Snapdragon 820 has two times the performance and efficiency of the Snapdragon 810 while at the same time consuming 30% less power overall based on their own tests. According to  Anandtech , new information on the Snapdragon 820’s CPU best describes it as an HMP solution with two high performance cores clocked at 2.2 GHz and two low-power cores clocked at 1.6 or 1.7 GHz. The company also claims that the new Adreno 530 GPU boasts a significant boost in graphics performance, compute capabilities and power usage, recording a 40% improvement over the Adreno 430.  Engadget reports  that the 3D environments Qualcomm had running on the Snapdragon 820 reference tablets looked much more crisp and far more impressive than those running on the Snapdragon 810 last year, bordering on game console quality. Keeping up with their attempt at making the most advanced mobile processor ever created, the Snapdragon 820 comes with support for 802.11ad WiFi and 802.11ac 2×2 MU-MIMO. This allows WiFi speeds to be up to two or three times faster than existing 802.11ac without MU-MIMO. Qualcomm adds that consumers can expect 802.11ad routers to start appearing next year. The chip’s model also sports improvements with support of LTE Category 12 download speeds of up to 600 Mbps and LTE Category 13 upload speeds of up to 150 Mbps. Qualcomm’s latest chip also supports LTE-U, which allows the chip to access LTE connections in both licensed spectrum and unlicensed spectrum — boosting connection speeds and mobile broadband access in normally congested areas. Qualcomm’s new child also sports the company’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, Sense ID. For more information on Sense ID and how it works, we talked about it  here .  Engadget got a chance to witness this ultrasonic technology  in action and remarked that it worked just as fast as Apple’s Touch ID implementation, adding that a little dirt on the Qualcomm’s reps fingers didn’t slow it down at all. On paper, this new Snapdragon looks to be a significant improvement over its predecessor but whether it will become another  hot topic  like its predecessor remains to be seen.

Priced from RM3,599.  The iPad Pro is the largest and the most expensive iOS device that Apple has ever built. At 12.9 inches and the option to add on a keyboard and a “Pencil” stylus, it is obvious that Apple is jumping on the convergence bandwagon. This coming Wednesday, 11th November, Apple will be making the iPad Pro available across 40 countries including Malaysia through the online store. If you prefer to feel it before parting ways with your money, Apple says you can get it from their stores and authorised resellers by the end of this week.   In terms of price, the iPad Pro cost nearly as much as a MacBook Air. The base 32GB WiFi model is going for US$799 (about RM3,505) while the 128GB version goes for US$949 (about RM4,164). For complete connectivity, the extra cellular (3G/4G) support with 128GB storage carries a hefty US$1079 (about RM4,734) price tag. As comparison, the 11″ MacBook Air is going for US$899 or RM4,099 in our Malaysian online Apple Store (after recent price revision).  To complete your iPad Pro experience, the matching keyboard cover and pencil are sold separately. The Pencil stylus that lasts 12 hours on a single charge is sold at US$99 (about RM434), while the Smart keyboard will set you back by US$169 (about RM741). The overall iPad Pro full package is really expensive and it makes the already pricey  Microsoft Surface Pro 4  seem like a bargain. The biggest difference of course is that the iPad Pro is still running on iOS while the Surface gives you a full fledged Windows 10 experience.

We’ve talked about the leaked photos showing the component underneath the device itself  here , but since July no other news had come around. Well it took you long enough,  Xiaomi . Although lacking a display, the original  Mi Band  was really affordable – RM 59 at the time of launch. We’re hoping that the new tech inside won’t make a huge price difference, once it arrives in Malaysia but more on that later. The new wearable could give other more expensive activity trackers a run for their money, since adding the optical heart-rate sensor.  Pretty much everything else is the same but if you need a further recap, the older model’s features are still maintained with the step counter and sleep monitor. And it’ll still be able to unlock your Mi smartphone when in range. Those who’ve racked up all the different colourful bands might be disappointed though, since the new model doesn’t match the old dimensions, Mi Band 1S – 37 x 13.6 x 9.9mm; Mi Band – 36 x 14 x 9mm. It weighs 5.5grams and has the same dust and water protection rating at IP67. Pairing through Bluetooth 4.0, it’ll run with any Android device that has at least Android 4.4 or any iPhone on iOS 7 and up.  Making its way inside the device, is a 45 mAh battery, a step up from the 41 mAh in the old model. It previously had a 30-day battery life rating but it’s likely that adding the optical sensor might take a toll on the battery life but we’ll see with the added 4 mAh.

With more devices relying on USB power, Xiaomi has announced its largest power bank yet, with a gigantic 20,000mAh capacity.  The current  16,000mAh power bank  which  retails  for RM89 is quite a heft at 350 grams and Xiaomi has managed to make the new 20,000mAh version lighter at only 338 grams. That’s even lighter than two of the latest  10,000mAh power bank  that weighs 207 gram each. The design is different from its current models as it uses polycarbonate materials instead of the usual metal, contributing to its massive weight reduction. To provide better grip, the power bank has a perforated texture on top which Xiaomi claims to be scratch resistant. Like the 16,000mAh version, there are two USB outputs, that pushes a maximum of 5.1V/3.6A combined. It is even capable of charging a USB Type-C enabled MacBook up to 1.2X. A 4-LED battery level indicator is retained at the top, while the power/status button has been shifted to the side. Knowing that 20,000mAh will take almost eternity to charge up to full, it supports quick charge supporting 5V/2A, 9V/1.2A and 12V/1.5A. In just 3 hours, you would have gotten 11,000mAh charged, compared to its 10,000mAh power bank that does 5,000mAh in the same duration.

The 20,000mAh Mi Power Bank goes on sale in China for 149 CNY (about RM101.40) and it will be available on Single’s Day on 11th November.

Most recently,  Nexus 6P  owners have taken to reddit to voice their concerns and experiences with the device. As we all know, the latest Nexus has glass on the back (a very small part) for its rear camera and other sensors. But what you wouldn’t expect is the rear glass panel suddenly cracking for no reason. First encountered by a reddit user by the name “jonny_rat”, the owner recalls his experience, thus raising some huge concerns about how  Huawei  went into making these panels. The way jonny pictures it, the device was on a table, unattended and suddenly for no reason the glass just cracked. He isn’t alone as other users have also reported the panel splitting unexpectedly without fault or impact. Here are more photos below for you to take a look: A lot of science goes into the making of these intricate components, especially when you have a manufacturer like Corning involved. Though it’ll be tough to verify if these claims are true, and most importantly if no user error was involved. Until more reports surface or Google/Huawei makes an official statement, we’ll just have to rest on our laurels. These problems highlight a key complication with metal unibody devices, since metal as an element is more reactive to temperatures, humidity and air pressure compared to polycarbonate and other plastics. Huawei’s graceful entry into metal devices ( honor 7 ,  Mate S  and  P8 ) and eventual Nexus 6P was bound to bump into some issues along the road, so this wasn’t entirely unexpected. Bend-gate has been a thing since the iPhones and stress testing devices with this forceful (literal) methodology could now be seen as a “standard” for tech enthusiast. By now, mostly everyone interested would’ve seen the two bend tests by  JerryRigEverything . The YouTuber in question took the Nexus 6P to its limits, halving the phablet in the process. Some individuals doubted the authenticity of the video and the way he went upon testing but after releasing a  second video , more people have started to consider that maybe Huawei’s device isn’t as tough as it’s assumed. The news is definitely worrying for potential buyers to know, however a quick  search  on YouTube will show you people trying the same thing but failing to bend the phones – adding more drama to the whole situation. As users ourselves, it’s painful to watch anyone destroy a piece of tech but it’s nice to know that these people do it so we don’t have to. Let’s hope Huawei and Google explain themselves soon enough (like  Apple  did) since Malaysians might get the latest Nexus line by year end. The smartphone industry has to brace themselves as consumers find out new ways to point out design flaws in their products, they’ll either have to toughen up their products or substitute it with a material that can hold up to these tests.

Arif Lee,Xiaomi possibly announcing the Redmi Note 2 Pro on the 11th of November,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/09/xiaomi-possibly-announcing-the-redmi-note-2-pro-on-the-11th-of-november/,"11.11,2,China,finger print,fingerprint,metal,Mi,Mi 5,Note,Pro,Redmi,Redmi Note 2,scanner,sensor,Singles Day,Xiaomi","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Xiaomi",2015-11-09,"Revisiting our  post  earlier in October, we talked about how the alleged  Redmi Note 2 Pro  would be a metal encased phablet. A totally new venture for the Chinese company (since the  Mi Note  and  Mi 4  only have metal edges), the metal body could possibly not be the only new feature; rear-mounted fingerprint sensor included. New photos have arrived showing the outer shell and it pretty much corroborates older images but still leave us unsure if  Xiaomi  would pack all this in a mid-range device. Since the  Redmi Note 2  will be available (in Malaysia) for pre-order in 2 days, this timely news might deter buyers who’d prefer a metal-clad phablet. That said, if the rumours are true, the Redmi Note 2 Pro could carry a 5.5-inch display but no information states whether it’ll maintain the 1080p resolution like the regular variant. Once you find your way inside, there will be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor coupled with either of these memory configurations: 2GB RAM + 16GB internal storage – 1099 yuan (RM 756) 
3GB RAM + 32GB internal storage – 1299 yuan (RM 893) 
4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage – 1499 yuan (RM 1030) Something definitely doesn’t tally with this information but from photos we can say that a device does indeed exist. Whether it’ll actually be a Redmi Note 2 Pro is a whole other story. Firstly, it doesn’t make sense to pack a fingerprint sensor and premium build, in a mid-range product – if you were to do it, it would definitely be in your flagship. Another problem would be, why release a higher-end Redmi Note 2 if you just released it in August. But then again, we feel it won’t be anything else since the  Mi 4C  was supposed to be a “respectable “replacement to the Mi 4. If Xiaomi truly decides to release a device with the aforementioned price points, this could be the most expensive Redmi to date. We’re as confused as you are but do keep in mind that these are all rumours, the only thing that is considered to be factual would be Xiaomi will release a smartphone on 11.11. Let us know your thoughts below and help us come up with some reasoning as to what Xiaomi might be planning. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Rory Lee,Samsung’s Galaxy Golden 3 gets the thumbs up from TENAA,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/09/samsungs-galaxy-golden-3-gets-the-thumbs-up-from-tenaa/,"Android,Flip phone,GFXbench,rumour mill,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Gold 3,SM-W2016,smartphone,tenaa","Android,Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-11-09,"Samsung ’s SM-W2016, which was first leaked by  GFXBench on their website last month  and will most likely be the Samsung’s brand new flip phone, the Galaxy Golden 3, has been certified by China’s regulatory agency  TENAA . According to TENAA, the next iteration of Samsung’s flip phone series will feature 3.9-inch internal and external screens, both with a 768 x 1280 resolution. The flip phone will also feature an octa-core 2.1GHz CPU with 3GB of RAM along with 64GB of non-expandable storage under the hood. The Galaxy Golden 3 will come pre-loaded with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. This latest leak raises some questions regarding the actual size of the Galaxy Golden 3’s screen as GFXBench had listed the screen size to be 4.6 inches. Regardless, the flip phone will come with a 16-megapixel rear shooter and a 5-megapixel front facing camera for selfies and video chats. While no information on the chipset type was revealed by TENAA, GFXBench alleges that the Galaxy Golden 3 will get a high-end Exynos 7 SoC with a Mali-T760MP8 GPU. The Galaxy Golden 3 will weigh 204 grams, up 24 grams from the original model’s 179 grams and will be 15.1mm thick. This thickness comes as no surprise because flip phones have always had the tendency to be thicker than its unhinged counterpart. While the phone itself has not been announced by Samsung, the previous Galaxy Golden and Galaxy Golden 2 have been given the model number SM-W2014 and SM-W2015 respectively. Logic then dictates that the SM-W2016 would be the Galaxy Golden 3. Unfortunately TENAA did not publish any photographs of the phone, however, now that it has received its certification, we could likely see the flip phone revealed by Samsung soon. Although clamshell phones are no longer popular, a big part due to the inconvenience of actually having to flip the phone open as well some instances of wonky phone displays due to the hinge, it seems that Samsung still believes in this relatively niche market as this would be the third installment of the Galaxy Golden phone series.

Alexander Wong,Not impressed with the HTC One A9?

Since its  introduction , the metal clad smart phone is constantly accused of being a  copy of the iPhone 6/6s . Besides, it gets a mid-range spec and it loses the front facing BoomSound stereo speakers. If you’re hoping for something better, HTC is rumoured to be working on a new One X9 that looks promising. From the purported leaked image shown above, the One X9 looks like an evolution of its HTC Butterfly series. The top and bottom grill indicates the presence of its Boom Sound speakers and surprisingly it appears to have capacitive buttons in front. That’s rather odd since HTC smart phone these days have opted for on-screen buttons. It is alleged that it will carry a 5″ display that pushes a Quad HD (2560×1440) resolution with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Helio X20 processor running on -board. The rumour continues with a massive 4GB of RAM, a 23MP main + 4MP Ultrapixel camera bombo and a generous on-board storage of 64GB to 128GB. Breaking its tradition of using smaller than average batteries, the One X9 is said to be fitted with a larger 3,500mAh capacity unit. Looking at the timing, it is strange that HTC is releasing a high-end device at this time of the year, especially when the new One M series is due for replacement during MWC 2016. Like all rumours, we urge you to take this with a pinch of salt. [  SOURCE  ]"

Arif Lee,TAG Heuer partners up with Google and Intel to launch its first smartwatch,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/10/tag-heuer-partners-up-with-google-and-intel-to-launch-its-first-smartwatch/,"Android Wear,google,intel,intel inside,Price,processor,SmartWatch,swiss made,swiss watch,TAG Heuer,TAG Heuer Connected,TAG Heuer price,TAG heuer smart watch,TAG smart watch,time piece,timepiece,watch,wearable","Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Smart Watch",2015-11-10,"Born and bred in St-Imier, Switzerland, there has always been something special about TAGs to a layman consumer. On the other hand ,to a timepiece aficionado the brand is usually the butt of jokes but its heritage is world-renown. Same goes for their ability to innovate; streamlining the chronograph just one illustration. Somewhere down the line, they’ve lost their footing and are trying once again appeal to the wider consumer base. How can they turn it around with the  TAG Heuer  Connected? Jan-Claude Biver the CEO has officially announced how much this luxury watch will go for – setting you back a cool US$ 1,500 (RM 6,581), this wearable better be worth the money. If you ask us personally, knowing that your buying a TAG at that price (even if it doesn’t have the Swiss-made seal of approval) is a good deal; a quick run through some of their most affordable models and you’ll see that the starting price hover around the US$ 1k mark. Obviously geared for a posher market, Mr Biver was quoted to say that it’ll be similar to the  Apple Watch , in terms of what it can do, though you shouldn’t in any way compare the two together. “I forbid my colleagues to say Apple is our competitor” – as said by the CEO. The titanium built Carrera inspired Connected will run pretty much like other smartwatches by wirelessly connecting to your smartphone for a wide array of features. On your wrist this 46mm beast will be relatively large when compared to the biggest Apple Watch at 42mm. It might even be larger than the 46mm  Moto 360 , as far as we can tell from photos. Ladies, if you’re into the whole smart wearable luxury segment (if that existed prior to this – no we aren’t gonna bother comparing to the US$ 17,000 Apple Watch), the Swiss makers have plans to fashion a smaller version in the future. Admittedly, TAG Heuer have mentioned for the time being, their main market base are for males. Those on the edge of heritage, craftsmanship and tradition who’d want to try out a named smartwatch can give this wearable a go for 2 years; after which, if you decide its not for you, a US$ 1,500 top up will get you a trade-up/in to a traditional mechanical Carrera. Keep in mind that Carreras retail way over US$ 3,000, a worthy bargain if you have the cash to splash. Running on the  Android Wear  platform, you’ll have access to some special watch faces and some dedicated apps to help you with dining options and golf tracking. It’s has a 1.5-inch LCD sapphire glass screen at 360 x 360 resolution and come with 4GB of internal storage. Paying a pretty penny for this smartwatch, it leaves out an important piece that you’d expect to get for its price; an optical heart-rate sensor. Considering you aren’t too bummed out, it does however house a gyroscope, tilt detection sensor, microphone, haptic engine and a 410 mAh battery (that TAG Heuer promises will get you 30 hours of battery-life). With Intel-inside, it’ll run a 1.6GHz dual-core Atom processor mated to 1GB of RAM. For connectivity, there’s Wi-Fi (B/G/N) and Bluetooth 4.0 to pair with your iOS 8 (or higher) device or at least an Android running version 4.3 (and up). Big tech giants  Intel  and  Google  both had some part in creating the smartwatch, proving that it could be a formidable time piece. It’ll hit New York first, available in 6 watch strap options, with only 1,000 units for sale, while Europe will see it in similar fashion 3 days after. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ,  3  ]"
Alexander Wong,DirectD brings the OnePlus X to Malaysia and it is available today,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/05/directd-brings-the-oneplus-x-to-malaysia-and-it-is-available-today/,"Android,DirectD,Dual Sim,OnePlus,OnePlus Malaysia,OnePlus X,OnePlus X Malaysia,OnePlus X Price","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-11-05,"Last week OnePlus had announced the  X , a 5″ mid-ranger that sits right below its existing  OnePlus One  and  OnePlus 2  in terms of specs. Instead of a top spec flagship killing machine, the OnePlus X focuses more on design aesthetics. If you can’t wait for the official sales that come with its annoying invitation system, you can get it now in Malaysia thanks to our local grey importer, DirectD.  Likely to be the Onyx version, DirectD is offering the OnePlus X for RM1,299 inclusive of GST. That’s not too shabby considering it retails for US$249 (RM1,069) in the US and 269 Euro (about RM1,255) in Europe.  To recap on the specs, the internals are quite similar with the first OnePlus One model except for its smaller screen. The front gets a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display giving a 440 ppi pixel density and it runs on a Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM. Storage wise it packs just 16GB but this time it is expandable with microSD.  Like the OnePlus 2, it gets a hybrid dual-SIM slot supporting two SIM cards or alternative 1 SIM plus 1 microSD card. For imaging, the OnePlus X gets a 13MP f/2.2 camera with a single LED flash, while the front gets a 8MP selfie camera. Keeping the lights on is a 2,525mAh battery and it also gets a 3-step alert slider on the sides like the bigger OnePlus 2 sibling. Out of the box, it runs on OxygenOS that’s based on Android 5.1.1.  For the price and the specs it offers, it is pretty close to the OnePlus One that’s  priced  at RM1,399 with GST. You get the exact same specs inside plus a larger 5.5″ Full HD screen. However do note that it only comes with a Single SIM slot and it lacks a microSD expansion slot and the new alert slider.  If you’re interested, you can order the OnePlus X  online . Alternatively you can drop by their showroom at Subang Jaya or at their Gadget Mega Store along Federal Highway. According to DirectD, stocks will be available starting today 5th November after 7PM.

The Kirin processor lineup by its own HiSilicon subsidiary has finally risen to the occasion and the folks at Qualcomm should really start to worry especially with it its  overheating issues . For instance, the Kirin 920 on the Honor 6 performs almost on par with their high-end Snapdragon 800 series processor. With Samsung currently enjoying the limelight with its epic Exynos 7420 processor, Huawei is attempting to knock them off with its brand new Kirin 950 processor. This new powerhouse is likely to debut on their upcoming  Mate 8 .  Announced at Beijing today, the Kirin 950 is set to be a game changer. It is manufactured based on a 16nm fab process and it uses 4x high performance ARM Cortex A72 cores that are clocked up to 2.3GHz that’s accompanied by 4x low power Cortex A53 cores at 1.8GHz. Running in a big.LITTLE set up, this helps to optimise the Octa-Core processor to balance between performance and power consumption. As comparison, Samsung’s Exynos 7420 is based on a 14nm process, with 4x Cortex A57 and 4x Cortex A53 while the current Snapdragon 810 is based on 20nm.  For graphics, it relies on a Mali-T880 GPU and there’s also a little i5 co-processor as well. In terms of performance it does look promising as the preliminary Antutu benchmark scored over 80,000 points, surpassing the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the  Meizu Pro 5 . Likely to be featured on their upcoming Mate 8, a new device was spotted on  Geekbench  scoring over 6200 for Multi-Core tests, which is much higher than what the Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone 6s Plus  have recorded . To cater for your future flagship needs, it will support  VoLTE  and 4G LTE-A connectivity as well.  Overall it does look very promising and out of nowhere, HiSilicon is looking like a compelling rival to Samsung’s high-end Exynos processors. Of course the Korean semiconductor division won’t be standing still and they are expected to reveal a newer processor ahead of its upcoming Galaxy S7.  [  SOURCE   2   3  ]"

Since 2011 their stock price has plummeted 90%, leading them to be pulled off the main Taiwan stock exchange market; TWSE 50. Is it pompous ignorance, bad marketing or just market strategies? A  sharp fall  from grace that has seen them at one time, account for 24% of all smartphone shipments when their stocks were valued at the highest. Meant to be the (slightly) larger affordable alternative to its flagship,  HTC One M9+ , the  One E9+  occupies the under 2k category by being priced at RM 1,899 – RM 700 less than its more premium sibling. Other than that large screen what do you notice almost immediately? The lack of the fingerprint sensor on the front and the dual-camera set up on the back. In short, yes but has the HTC name suffered too much to revitalise itself? Many questions that require many answers. Hopefully we’ll address each and every one of them in our review.  At its price point it faces competition  Samsung Galaxy A8 , the  OnePlus 2  (if you can get your hands on it),  Mi Note , and  Oppo R7 Plus . Has the HTC One E9+ have what it takes?"

Enlisting help from a partner that is essentially one of the big guns in the touch-based solutions interface industry, it seems like pressure-sensitive tech is catching on quickly and will soon be on the Mi 5 (or whatever they intend on calling it). Showcasing a (superimposed) demo of how future devices would run this technology on their touchscreens, ClearForce will hypothetically allow you to access additional options based on the pressure applied on the screen. These were the features shown in the video demo: Adding to the list of two devices that currently support some form of pressure-sensitive tech – the high-end  Huawei Mate S  (as seen above) and Apple’s  iPhone 6s  line, it shouldn’t be long off before other manufacturers join their ranks. While marketed as a huge revelation, there hasn’t been much information if users found the feature something necessary to have. Chinese tech blogs are saying that the collaboration between the two companies will be available on the Mi 5 but there hasn’t been a lot of leaks regarding the new flagship. What else might be inside Xiaomi’s next smartphone? Well apparently there will be Qualcomm’s newest chipset, the Snapdragon 820 but there hasn’t been anything substantial coming out of China just yet, so hold on to your cash for now. In its early stages, there’s still a lot of doors that this type of technology hasn’t seen yet but it’s nice to know that smartphone makers and hardware manufacturers are still attempting to create a new experience. Have you tried the iPhone 6s? Does having 3D Touch improve user experience by a huge margin? Let us know in the comments below. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

Following the notion that bigger is better, the iPad Pro is the largest iPad yet spanning 12.9 inches with a display that does 2732×2048 resolution at 264 ppi.  The iPad Pro is designed to be a mobile powerhouse with a A9X chip under the hood that’s accompanied by a M9 co-processor. Also thrown in is a 8MP iSight camera and a front facing 1.2MP camera. It gets dual-mics and 4 speakers with one placed in each corner. With a larger screen, it is heavier at 713g for WiFi and 723g for the Cellular version. However they have managed to keep the bulk down to a mere 6.9mm, which is thinner than the earlier iPad Air (7.5mm).  Apple claims that the iPad Pro display is the most advanced Retina display ever built. Apart from pushing an ultra high resolution display, it is able to track the Pencil’s input at 240 times per second, giving it a lag free response. On top of that, the display not only detects Pencil movement and pressure, but also the amount of tilt for a more realistic stroke effect that’s critical for illustrators. To maintain the same 10 hour of battery life, the iPad Pro display is smart enough to switch between 60Hz and 30Hz to conserve on power. The full iPad Pro and accessory pricing for Malaysia are priced as follows: If you have the money to splurge, you can place your orders now with shipping estimated to reach you by next week, 17th November. The iPad Pro comes in Gold, Silver and Space Grey colours.  In terms of accessories, it will cost you quite a bit at RM799 for the Smart Keyboard and RM429 for the stylus Pencil. So at the bare minimum, that’s RM4,398 for an iPad Pro 32GB WiFi with a keyboard. If you plan on doing serious work, a  MacBook Air  11″ can be yours from RM4,099, while the bigger 13″ version starts from RM4,549.

Tizen, a Linux based mobile OS that supersedes Samsung’s Bada OS has finally overtaken BlackBerry as the 4th biggest smart phone platform. While we hardly see any Tizen smart phones in our market, Samsung has found significant success in the Indian market. According to IDC’s Q2 2015 smart phone OS  market share report , Android dominates the top spot at 82.8%, followed by iOS at 13.9% and Windows Phone nabbing 3rd place at 2.6%. BlackBerry has been declining by the years from 4.9% market share (at #3 spot) back in 2012, to a new low of just 0.3% at 4th place in Q2 2015. IDC has yet to update its Q3 figures, but  Strategy Analytics  has just reported that Tizen has shown tangible growth, propelling itself to overtake the once popular platform known for security.  The biggest growth comes from Samsung’s Tizen Z series that’s hugely popular in India. Despite Microsoft inching its way into the affordable segment, the Tizen platform has managed to  claim the #2 spot  in the local budget segment. Similar to Android, Tizen is an open-source platform. In order to entice more app development, Samsung is giving 100% app revenue back to its developers.  It was surprising that Tizen had a fighting chance, considering there are ample of cheap Android smart phones in their market. The  Samsung Z1  came with very low specs for INR 5,700 (about RM373). It gets a basic 4″ WVGA display, an entry level dual-core processor, 768MB of RAM and paltry 3.1MP + VGA cameras. The latest addition is the Samsung Z3 which offers a 5″ HD display, a Quad-Core 1.3GHz processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage for a mere INR 8,399 (about RM550).  As for BlackBerry, they are hoping to turn their fortunes around as they are making the switch to Android. Being a business focused device, the upcoming  BlackBerry PRIV  is more expensive than their current BlackBerry Passport, which gives it very little appeal for the masses. In their current predicament, BlackBerry hopes to sell  5 million smart phones  or they might consider leaving the mobile business altogether.  [  SOURCE   2  ]"
Arif Lee,You can now watch ALL YouTube videos in Cardboard VR mode,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/06/you-can-now-watch-all-youtube-videos-in-cardboard-vr-mode/,"360-degree,camera,Cardboard,Cardboard App,Cardboard VR,google,Google Cardboard,Google VR,Oculus RIft,Samsung Gear VR,view,virtual reality,VR,You Tube,youtube","Android,Cool stuff,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-11-06,"Video immersion and virtual reality (VR) technology has hit the consumer market with the likes of  Samsung’s Gear VR ,  Oculus’s Rift  and the most affordable entry-level one being the  Google Cardboard . Users would prefer to be in the places they’re watching on their screens and this coincides with Google’s foray into Street View and 360 degree videos on YouTube. But now, they’ve added full support for Cardboard on all videos listed on their streaming site – even if they weren’t filmed using a 360-degree camera. No matter the occasion or location, the new YouTube app hands you two useful features; the first (isn’t all that new) lets you select the Cardboard icon once in full-screen mode in existing content that has 360-degree views. While the camera equipment to get a shot like this running will cost a bomb, so there isn’t much readily available videos just yet. The second add-on is where things get a little more interesting. So if you’ve noticed on your Android device that there’s a symbol in the settings that you’ve never seen before, give it a go. It’ll theoretically allow you to view any video in Cardboard view – no, it won’t magically make viewable in 360-degree but if you want a cinematic experience, why not? If you aren’t familiar with the Cardboard UI, it halves the screen, shrinks the video and mirrors it on the two sides. The screen stays in place in the “virtual” world, so it’ll depend on your smartphone’s gyroscope to centre your viewing.   In any case that you can’t find this option on your Android device, check if your YouTube is up-to-date and if it still doesn’t work, look up the  Cardboard app  on the Play Store; if it says your device isn’t compatible (apparently it doesn’t run on our Sony Xperia M5 Dual).

In essence, Trivoly attaches itself underneath your regular watch, so nothing odd happens to your original timepiece – it does however, pack some great features in its small body. It secures itself on to the underside of your watch via Gecko-tape, a derivative of a suction cup mechanism. Measuring just 3mm thin, you’re likely to notice a bump but not by much. Once placed, it’ll sync up to your smartphone and provide notifications by vibrating or lighting up its LEDs to correspond to your settings. Trivoly’s UI lives inside an app, allowing you to do some great things when you tap around your watch face (actually the side of the disc but it’s all the same). The app lets you personalise your notifications by setting different colours and vibration patterns. There’s also a discreet function to avoid certain interruptions by prioritising the contacts you’ve managed. Inside the disc lives an optical heart rate sensor and accelerometer to support your fitness lifestyle by enabling advanced tracking for exercise on the dedicated app. Other features included are multimedia controls for apps like SONOS, iTunes and Spotify by taping from the top, bottom, left and right – each functioning differently and acting as a remote control of sorts. Lastly, it’ll also act as a wireless picture taking controller; up to 25 feet away, a simple tap will start a countdown timer and after 3 seconds a photo is taken. Hypo allergenic in nature and water resistant, the manufacturer promises the device will give you up to 4 days of battery life. Currently, it supports iPhone 5’s (and up) on iOS 8 or later, as well as Android smartphones that run at least 4.2 (and up). There will be two versions of the Trivoly, as the low end variant doesn’t have the fitness tracker component. At this current time, Trivoly 1 costs US$ 99 (RM 427), while the higher-end Trivoly 2 goes for US$ 129 (RM 556). The makers promise to have the device shipped to you in February 2016. Trivoly’s invention should be compared to the  Mi Band  – that offers almost the same thing (minus the camera, music control option and smaller form factor) and that only costs RM 69 (that’s nearly 6 times less), so choose wisely if you’re interested in pledging. Head on over  here  to find out more about the Trivoly Kickstarter project. [  VIA  ]"

Following the onslaught of who’s the “best”, “widest” and “fastest” 4G LTE network, Maxis aims to put this issue to bed by releasing company data on how they classify their 4G LTE network. Moreover, the green coloured telco has also proposed to have a forum with two of its competitors to talk about the state of 4G LTE in Malaysia. Getting the ball rolling on a pressing issue that has left Malaysian baffled by both telcos claims (Digi and Maxis), this could mean that consumers will at the end gain more out of this. The initiator of all this has issued an open invitation to any member of the public to prove them wrong on their “widest” 4G LTE network; they also hope Digi and Celcom follow suit. Setting the date for the 23 rd  of November, Maxis hopes that this platform will allow all three networks to have their own telecommunications engineers to talk about how they gauge their coverage. And at the end of the day, Maxis claims that they want to do this for consumers; evidently to let us “have a fair basis for choosing”. Strangely, Maxis has left out the 4 th  major player in the market, U Mobile. Possibly since the company isn’t publicly listed, otherwise we’d best not speculate further. While everyone claims to provide the “widest” 4G LTE, we’re still questioning if they’ve diverted their attention to problems that their customers are facing everyday – even in the heart of the Klang Valley. Our readers have been very open about their experiences on their networks, with some stating that there are service blind spots in popular landmarks and areas around the major cities. Silly if you think of it really, the fact that their customers in their key market areas are facing issues and they want to go on record being the “widest”, “fastest”, and “best” network. Previously, we talked about what all these bold titles mean to consumers, you can check it out  here . But if you’re really into these figures that Maxis has published, they are listed below: *Do note that aside from the  first three lines , no 3rd party testing has been conducted to verify the “statements” by Maxis above* It’s easy to talk numbers and standards but do they really reflect in real-life situations? We’ve tried testing Maxis’ network at KLCC, on a weekday night and from the photo below, you can see we only managed 7Mbps download speeds, so what gives? We now throw it back to the telcos, step up your game, stop all the bickering and maintain your network coverage (and speed) across all your services – no matter 2G, 3G or 4G. We want a consistent experience, it doesn’t matter to us if you’re the widest if you can’t deliver in reality. There has been no official statement from either Digi and Celcom yet (but be fair to them, it’s a public holiday today). Once they’ve replied we’ll keep everyone updated. It’ll be a great thing to see our cellular providers meet in a neutral setting, we hope that all three will decide to have an unbiased moderator and that the public will be allowed to grill them on their gripes.

Habitual behaviour can either make you fit as an ox with a diet to boot, or drown you to becoming a sluggish sloth but how does Sony’s sequal match up? As a display-less band, it won’t serve you any time-telling information, nor will it give any real-time tracking, so it might add extra heft to your existing watch-filled wrist. The predecessor didn’t have a HRM, basically only offering you notification for calls, texts and other apps. There’s an accelerometer living inside the shell of the smartwatch, so it’ll track walking, running and other movement related activities. All your info will be viewed on the manufacturer’s Lifelog app, giving you a detailed insight into how much you’ve been moving around – or lack thereof. Sony also throws in a sleep tracker that monitors how well your slumber sessions are and is also enabled with a smart alarm clock, that vibrates on cue. The device’s notifications will come to you in either through a simple vibration or RGB LEDs that flashes when something comes in. The SmartBand 2 also gives you the ability to control music on your smartphone or tablet – taping to play, pause and skip through your tracks. If you’re the forgetful type, the device is smart enough to monitor proximity, alerting you when you’re further than 10 metres from your paired devices. Charging will take 2 hours to get it topped up, and it’ll last you up to 2 days. Being a Sony, it classically is IP68 waterproof. If you’re interested in purchasing the SmartBand 2 or taking a closer look at it yourself, you can find it at Sony Stores (the Curve and KLCC), Sony Centres and authorised dealers nationwide. Available in an array of colour options – white, black, indigo, and pink; it’ll retail for RM 599. You can visit the product site  here ."

For those who crave a bigger screen, you might want to watch out for their announcement at the end of this month.  As seen above, Huawei has posted a teaser image of a new Mate device with a prominent number “8” which strongly hints the Mate 8. In terms of specs, Huawei is keeping most of the details well under wraps but it is speculated that they would be fitting its latest Kirin 950 processor that’s going to be unveiled this Thursday.  According to  early leaks , the Kirin 950 appears to be a serious powerhouse outdoing the Samsung Exynos 7420 chipset by 20% in Multi-core and 30% in Single-core tests on GeekBench. The new Octa-Core chip comprises of 4x Cortex A72 cores and 4x Cortex-A57. It will support faster LPDDR4-RAM and in terms of graphics, it gets a Mali-T880 unit.  With Huawei having a 5.7″ Quad HD display on the  Nexus 6P , we are guessing that the Mate 8 might follow suit with a high resolution Quad HD display and possibly having 4GB of RAM. As comparison, the current Ascend Mate 7 gets a 6.0″ Full HD display and it comes with 2 variants – 2GB RAM + 16GB storage and 3GB RAM + 32GB storage. When it was launched in Malaysia, they are priced at RM1,799 and RM1,999 respectively without GST. With Huawei  going premium , expect the Mate 8 to carry a higher price tag than its predecessor. If you want something bigger, there’s the  P8 Max  but unfortunately it isn’t coming to Malaysia. [  SOURCE   2 ,  VIA  ]"

No matter in voice, video or text, we’ve all found new ways to get our messages across. Words fly across our screens all the time, especially in our instant messaging apps, but are letters enough? Do they allow individuals to express themselves well? If you feel you’ve always used Emojis more often than just plain text, you should take a look at the keyboard by EmojiWorks’. Usually our access to Emojis face an issue when it comes to PC compatibility, or at least non-mobile devices; unless you get a program that lets you display an on-screen keyboard. The list of these images/Emojis are constantly expanding and our need for them could be just cause they add more life into a conversation. Opening doors and new avenues with the Bluetooth enabled Emoji keyboard, EmojiWorks has begun taking pre-orders for the chiclet based typing slate and it’ll come in 3 options. The base model will get you 47 emojis; the Plus model hands you double, access to more than one skin tone option; the Pro version gets you almost triple the original emojis with 120 icons. These keyboards will come with the latest emoji icons (up to the last refresh) and it’ll be compatible with Apple products (Mac OS X and iOS) and Windows running machines (tablets, and PCs). The basis of having a keyboard would be allowing you to type in QWERTY format, and it gives you the same A-Z plus symbols and functionality as a regular keyboard – it’ll be smaller than most, since it rids itself of the numberpad keys. All three keyboards run on 2 AAA batteries and there’s an EmojiWorks specific software that you’ll have to install to get the emojis on your screen. Starting from US $79.95 (Emoji Keyboard), the mid-range model will cost US$ 89.95, while the top of the line Pro model will be just shy of US$ 100. They begin shipping in December. Has technology derailed the proper meaning of communication, to the point that humans are losing a piece of themselves in the process? Are these emojis merely images that don’t really reflect our actual emotions? Maybe we should backtrack and revert to the most personal way of communicating, at least then we’d all be more genuine.

Running  Windows 10 Mobile  and giving you a mimicked PC experience through  Continuum , does the  Windows  platform still have something to offer mobile users? Seems like Malaysians won’t need to wait much longer to find out. Although its design didn’t surprise us, the specs show some promise – especially when you take a look at its  camera credentials  and its docking system that opens up Continuum. The Lumia 950 will come with a 5.2-inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED ClearBlack display and Gorilla Glass 3 on top. The smaller flagship has only 6 cores, in its 1.8GHz Snapdragon 808 chipset, while mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage; definitely not such a powerhouse amongst the best processors but maybe Microsoft has optimised it to make it a seamless experience. Since the camera’s photos will be taking up most of your memory, Microsoft added a microSD slot allowing you to expand it up to an additional 200GB. Microsoft’s (actually Nokia’s) PureView camera is again touted to make waves, with its 20-megapixel f/1.9 aperture sensor. There’s a triple-LED RGB flash as well, illuminating any of your dimly lit photos. Having enough pixels, it’ll be capable of shooting 4K content in 30fps, while any audio will be picked up on the Lumia Rich Recording system that utilises the device’s 4 microphones. Your worries regarding shaky hands and its camera will be mediated by OIS and once you move on the front there’s a 5-megapixel wide angel f/2.4 lens, that allows FHD videos. All of the internals we talked about today will be energised by a 3,000 mAh battery. Other than its USB Type-C charging port, you can also make use of its Qi Wireless charging but the cable method will get you a quicker charger at 50% of battery in 30 minutes – claimed during the presentation. For connectivity, you’ll get 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Based on SIRIM, we’ll be getting the dual-SIM variant. The Lumia 950 is set to go on sale in the States soon, and will go for US$ 549 (RM 2,367) – if you were looking for a price range that helps indicate Malaysian pricing, you’ve got it. That said, at that price, consumers might look elsewhere, opting for devices from named power houses; if you were to spend a little extra. Photo-centric users might still give it a shot but we’ll just have to see what the device has to offer once it goes on sale. Let us know what you think so far of the new Lumia 950, does it stand a chance?"

As an imported unit, obviously there’s a premium to pay which makes it rather expensive. DirectD is offering the Nexus 5X 16GB version for RM2,099 (including GST). Without a microSD expansion slot, you probably might want to get the 32GB version but that would cost you more at RM2,499. For reference, the Nexus 5X in the US is sold officially at US$379 for 16GB (about RM1,632) and US$429 for 32GB (about RM1,847).   To refresh on the specs, the Nexus 5X is seen as the upgrade of its former Nexus 5. It gets a slightly bigger 5.2″ Full HD screen and under the hood it gets a respectable Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 with 2GB of RAM. For imaging, it gets a 12.3MP f/2.0 main camera with IR Laser AF while the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter with larger 1.4 micron pixel size.

Arif Lee,Does having the widest 4G LTE coverage matter to Malaysians?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/11/03/does-having-the-widest-4g-lte-coverage-matter-to-malaysians/,"4g,4G LTE coverage,4G LTE network coverage,Celcom,Celcom 4G,coverage,DiGi,DiGi 4G,lte,Mais 4G,Malaysia,Maxis,Maxis 4G,Maxis 4G LTE,network coverage,U Mobile,U Mobile 4G,widest 4g,widest 4G LTE,widest 4G lte coverage,widest coverage","Celcom,Cool stuff,DiGi,HSPA+,Industry in General,LTE,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Players on the Field,Technologies,U Mobile",2015-11-03,"Last month, two telcos made bold claims to have managed to hit at least 50% population coverage for 4G LTE –  Digi  (50%) and  Maxis  (55%). Issuing the who’s better  statements  within a short period, the two have been bitten by a bug to prove who has the true widest 4G LTE network. Question is, when telcos claim to have the widest coverage would you gauge it based on population percentile or percentage of coverage areas? Who sets the standards? And most important of all, does it matter? To get to the bottom of this, we’ll have to set some key definitions first about what 4G LTE is. In a data-driven generation, we all emphasis speed and with that speed comes the necessary technology to support our thirst for it. Malaysians have gotten a taste of 4G LTE in 2013 and were offered by Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. Referring to the specifications set by the United Nation’s official oversight commission (ITU-R) that monitors information and communication technologies; 4G LTE at its truest ( meaning ) would translate to 100 Mbps on the move, and roughly 1 Gbps when considered locally wireless. At least, in theory that is. Looking around the globe at some of the fastest speeds, none of them break the 40 Mbps mark. Referring to Open Signal’s “ State of LTE September 2015 ” report, these are the top 5 countries with the fastest (average) LTE speeds: New Zealand is the chart topper, posting 36Mbps; Singpore gets runner-up with 33Mbps; Romania surprisingly gets 30Mbps; South Korea gets the 4th spot with 29Mbps; Denmark rounds off the 5th spot with 26Mbps. Since the report refers to data from September, the info is backdated. Interestingly, Open Signal only has a sample size of approx. 300 thousand users – yes, a size quite small when you’re talking global proportions. In retrospect, Malaysian usually see a range of 15Mbps to 30Mbps but there have been instances where you’ll see a spike that actually meets the aforementioned standards. Surpassing and reaching LTE-Advance levels, which puts Maxis at the forefront (for the time being). Both sides will have a valid say, for example, what use would there be if you traveled to a desolated area in some deep jungle in the peninsular or eastwards? It’d be pointless (in a sense) to erect a cell tower in that area, because there wouldn’t be anyone to serve. But at the same time, if anyone were to be placed in that situation, aren’t they supposed to be covered, if their mobile operator is indeed the widest? Taking a look at the playing field, both telcos above (actually the major 4) run on the even platform – two spectrums: 1800GHz and 2600GHz. Ironically when 4G LTE was first rolled out, the iPhone 5 wasn’t able to run on LTE, as all networks were solely running on 2600GHz at the time. Lower bands get you better signal penetration (indoors and outdoors) but higher bands give you faster data speeds. In a race to the top, are telco providers forgetting that unless there is a way to quantify and verify their 4G LTE population coverage, it just simply an unrecognised title to hold? Do they deliver as promised? From our comments on Digi’s and Maxis’ coverage articles, many users are still facing service related issues. They’ve attached  photos  for reference, testing their speeds in claimed areas and disputing them accordingly. For customer experience to be considered, our local telco players tend to knock about the notion of providing the best but are they really delivering? Nationwide, many users have voiced out about drops in cellular quality but we’d rather hear your thoughts; many factors go into objectively testing networks around Malaysia but with our readers coming from all over, we hope to get some feedback and your concerns to your providers and let them address them. Should Malaysian cellular providers bother in claiming the top coverage(s) title? They should first mediate issues that are faced by their users on a day-to-day basis – delivering what users need, consistently giving them the value they paid for in the first place. If we were to take part in a full-blown test that manages to encapsulate the varying telcos and their corresponding ability to cover areas, there would be many puzzles pieces and putting them together would include: Taking a respective number of locations – e.g. over 100 locations nationwide (East Malaysia and West Malaysia) 
Using the same device, test the four telcos cellular data coverage 
Establish if there is 4G LTE in the area through corresponding symbols on these devices 
Test their speeds, take multiple tests on each network and get an average 
Find out if these 4G speeds are better than 3G HSPA+ or even lower bands (cause if it isn’t, what’s the point of having the widest 4G coverage?) 2G, 3G, 4G and whatever else that goes along with your user experience, it should be maintained across all their offerings, not being better here or coming short on the other. U Mobile has proven that while they were the new player, they’ve established a foothold in their 3G HSPA+ network with 4G-like speeds. We’re sure that users have had moments where nothing can be done on 3G (even with good coverage in that category). We have to start questioning the reasons why our providers are busy worrying about widest and fastest? Users would much prefer something tangible, and at the end of the day if their telcos work for them in their corresponding areas. Throwing marketing fluff here and there does nothing for their consumers. All we want is for our local players to show us why we should be on your network – through user experience, not some coverage map. Beside the fact, being the widest network shouldn’t be an issue, everyone should offer a wide network. Cellular data has become a necessity and our consumers deserve that, at the very least."

It’s an elegant looking leather belt that could juice up your smart phone during critical moments.    Being a flexible accessory, the Ion Belt uses a different battery cells from your typical power bank. Holding up 3,000mAh of charge is a specially designed ENCAPSULPAK, that consists of two steel layers to protect the batteries from stresses and potential damage.  To charge the belt, you can connect the middle buckle that doubles up as a USB connector to your existing USB chargers at home. Towards the end of the belt tip is a full size USB port which you can use to charge your smart phone and tablets.  To check on the battery levels, there’s an LED indicator light which can be activated by a push of a button. The belt comes in 3 different sizes so that you can pick one to fit your waistline. With the belt tip positioned close to your pocket, this makes it easy to charge your smart phone while it is in your pocket.  If you’re interested, the early bird Ion Belt units are going for US$89 (about RM381) if you pledge now. Officially it will retail for US$130 (about RM556) and stocks are expected to ship in June 2016. On Kickstarter, the Ion Belt currently has crossed the 50% mark of its US$50,000 goal. Interested?

The world is full of people who would love to get their hands on your private information; with hacks and identity theft at an all-time high, you’re never sure if your info will truly be safe. That extends to any messaging service, be it Whatsapp, Facebook chat and the like, you don’t know if the data flow is secure. That’s where Celcom’s Zipit Chat comes in, being the most secure communications app you’ll ever lay your eyes on.  The reason? It’s because it uses Military-Grade AES256 Encryption. How does it work? 
Like we mentioned earlier, Zipit Chat utilises Military-Grade AES256 Encryption, which keeps your chats very private by encrypting your messages to the point that even snooping security agencies won’t be able to break the code. Even your emails can be encrypted in a similar manner, with attachments of up to 10MB for videos and emails. So if someone manages to intercept it, all they’ll see is piles of gibberish. Your phonebook information will also be secure, and with this app screen capture is disabled for extra measure. Is it effective? 
Celcom ran a contest a little over a month ago that got people to attempt to decrypt three messages that have been encrypted by Zipit Chat and the results were pretty off the mark. While the text isn’t completely vulnerable to brute-forcing but it can only be decrypted with a secret key that’s specific to that text alone. It could take years for someone to figure it out otherwise! So if you’re looking for something that even the government won’t be able to get into, Zipit Chat is right for you. Zipit Chat is available from the  Google Play Store  for free till 30 November 2015."

Maybe that was why the company has just hired a former  Apple  director. A steady rise of the hardware quality has already begun, crafting devices like the  Ascend Mate 7 , the  P8  and of late the  Mate S  and co-creation of the  Nexus 6P . This news naturally means that  EMUI  should get some much needed refinement and rid themselves of gimmicky features like Knuckle Sense. Abigail Brody is  Huawei ‘s new hire and she served as Apple’s creative director, as chief user experience designer. Filling the role should come naturally, considering she worked for the software/hardware giants for nearly a decade. Quoted to have defined the way Apple’s applications look and feel from 2001 till 2011, her expertise in R&D will benefit China’s largest smartphone makers many times over. Brody’s vibes have also been felt in another top tier organisation – eBay, where she was the VP of Global Design. As one of the key designers of iOS 1, Aperture and Final Cut Pro, her repertoire could be a good fit for Huawei. Success isn’t easily repeated but you should expect EMUI’s interface to get a whole lot better once the manufacturer’s US design studio has been established.

Instead of a home grown Kirin processor, the Honor 5X runs on a mid-range Snapdragon 616 Octa-Core processor that’s mated with either 2GB or 3GB of RAM. On-board it has 16GB of storage which can be expanded via a dedicated microSD slot. This is good news for dual-SIM card users that prefer to use both SIM cards and microSD storage at the same time.   Like the honor 7, it gets a fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks instantly within 0.5 seconds. For imaging, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5MP f/2.4 shooter. Keeping the lights on is a decent 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports  Quick Charge 3.0 .

But will this trio be enough to revitalise the ailing Japanese mobile division of this multinational conglomerate? Struggling to find their footing domestically and internationally, the brand has lacked some ingenuity in its design portfolio for quite some time – both in hardware and software. They’ve had to rename their Xperia Z4 to a  Xperia Z3+  in the international segment to avoid a backlash from customers. If you didn’t know, Sony practises a biannual refresh for its mobile division. Since  IFA 2015 , their combination of the 4K screen and the latest Sony camera sensor has made the device the talk of the town (among other reasons) but what else do these three devices have to offer? Let’s work our way from the smallest of the bunch to their largest device. For starters, you’ll have the Xperia Z5 Compact, this youngling comes in a 4.6-inch form factor and its screen will display in a 720p (1280 x 720) resolution. Inside you’ll find the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor found across all three devices but of the three, the Xperia Z5 Compact has slightly less RAM at 2GB instead of 3GB. Plus, it’s waterproof. Storage-wise, you’re stuck with 32GB base internal storage but with a microSD card handy, you’ll be able to bump it up to 200GBs if you wish. As for the camera, the rear will get a huge 23-megapixel Exmor RS sensor, while the front receives a 5-megapixel snapper. The former is capable of a 0.3 second autofocus time and has an f/2.0 aperture G lens. Don’t forget this is the same sensor found on all three and  includes (claimed) advancements in low-light situations, 5x clear image (digital) zoom and Sony’s advanced processing software. If you’re into the pixel game, there’s also 4K video recording on board. The Compact also is the only one to have a single SIM set up, and it gets a smaller 2700 mAh battery. But like its siblings, it will run the same Android 5.1 Lollipop OS out of the box. Sony’s Xperia Z5 Dual fits the middle-child stereotype but it isn’t easily forgotten. Boasting a 5.2-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080), we’re kind of surprised that Sony didn’t up the ante by making it a QHD screen, but oh well. Similarly, it’ll get the same Snapdragon 810 SoC, 32GBs of internal storage and the same glorified camera modules, but is equipped with 3GB of RAM and a larger 2,900 mAh battery instead. The smartphone gets a dual-SIM LTE slot, bettering the single slot on its little brother as well. The most premium, coincidentally dubbed the Xperia Z5 Premium Dual is the first smartphone to carry a 4K (3840 x 2160) 5.5-inch screen; that accounts for 806 pixels per inch. Naturally, since it is able to display 4K, the aforementioned 23-megapixel camera will do it justice by allowing 4K video recording for you to test out the crazy screen. Its not too different internally to the Xperia Z5 Dual, with the only difference being the larger 3,430 mAh battery, there’s nothing much else that sets it apart. Notably, all three devices have an in-built fingerprint sensor, placed neatly out of the way on the side of the device – brushing your finger pass the sensor instantly unlocks your device, giving you bio-metric security as an option.  The three devices will be available for purchase in these colour options: Xperia Z5 Compact – Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral (RM 2,299) 
 Xperia Z5 Dual – Graphite Black, White, Gold and Green (RM 2,699) 
 Xperia Z5 Premium Dual –  Chrome, Black and Gold (Pricing will only be announced in November) For the time being and in limited quantities, Sony will be throwing some freebies together with the 3 devices today from the 31st of October till 22nd of November: Spectre official t-shirt (RM 109)

Landscape lay flat hardcover photobook (RM 259) You’ll be able to pick up  any member  the two smaller devices of the Xperia Z5 line at authorised Sony retailers nationwide from  today   the 31st of October, while the Xperia Z5 Premium Dual will only be available November onwards (no specification as to what date).

Being a symbol of Privilege and Privacy, the PRIV aims to be the most secure device that runs on Android. On top of that, it offers the best of both worlds featuring a touch-enabled double curve display and a full QWERTY keyboard in a single package. To recap on the specs, the PRIV gets a 5.4″ Quad HD display and underneath it runs on a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of RAM. 32GB of storage comes as standard but you’ll get expandability up to 2TB via microSD. For pictures, BlackBerry is fitting a 18MP main camera, while the front gets a modest 2MP shooter for selfies.  To support the busy executive routine, the PRIV gets a large 3,410mAh capacity battery which should last a whole day. Out of the box, it runs on Android Lollipop along with various BlackBerry apps that are made available on the  Google Play Store . The PRIV is expected to be a game changer with a widely adopted operating system that’s backed with BlackBerry’s reputable services. The end goal for the Waterloo company is to sell  5 million units , or else they might just call it quits on the mobile business.  If you’re interested, the PRIV won’t come cheap and it is more expensive than its current  BlackBerry Passport . Pre-orders have started in the US and in the UK at US$699 (about RM2,984) and 559 Pounds (about RM3,653) respectively. This is likely to cost more than a  Galaxy S6 edge+  once it gets here.

Arif Lee,Jabra wants to cater to all walks of life with four new audio devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/28/jabra-wants-to-cater-to-all-walks-of-life-with-four-new-audio-devices/,"Assist,Bluetooth,Bluetooth headset,earbuds,earphones,Eclipse,Halo Fusion,Jabra,Jabra Assist,Jabra Bluetooth,Jabra Eclipse,Jabra Halo Fusion,Jabra Sport Pace Wireless,Jabra STEEL,launch,Malaysia,official,Price,Sport Life,Sport Life app,Sport Pace Wireless,STEEL","Android,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Apps,Mobile OS",2015-10-28,"Individuals these days have very specific needs and as a manufacturer of audio solutions, Jabra is launching four devices across a wide range of lifestyles. There will be something for everyone, like the industrial processional with the Jabra STEEL; the avid traveller with the Halo Fusion; the business-savvy with the Eclipse, and the sport enthusiast with the Sports Pace Wireless. 
 We’ll take a look at all four devices, starting with the Jabra STEEL. Designed as a rugged Bluetooth headset to withstand the conditions of the work associated with some of the occupations featured on Mike Rowe’s “Dirty Jobs”; the sturdy audio earpiece is made to handle vigorous environments and has been thoroughly stressed in a series of tests that are faced by people in the line of work. Ideal for high decibel environments with its high definition voice/audio through a dual-microphone that makes use of active noise cancellation technology and isolates the user’s voice. The large button allows you to interact with Siri or Google Now with long presses and offers an option for voice activated pick-ups of calls; you can also use message readout if you’re using an Android device. Its ergonomic design also comes with a custom ear-hook that will mould to your ear to provide a secure fit, while on the job. The in-built battery will get you 6 hours of talk time, at the same time allowing a power nap feature to prevent it from zapping battery. The STEEL promises 10 days of standby time and roughly 2 hours will give it a full charge. It weighs only 10grams. The next wireless audio accessory is the Halo Fusion, a two-in-one (music and calls) option for those always on-the-go that need their music fix. Part of the Halo Fusion’s functionality is to bridge the gap between music listening and actual voice calls. Utilising the control button on the neck band will allow you to connect to your call through Bluetooth. A package that weighs 21grams, in the neckband and earbuds combo, it’ll keep on going for 6.5 hours before needing a recharge. Jabra lists the standby time at 19 days and allows you to pair up to 8 devices, while simultaneously being connected to 2 devices at any one time – e.g. Bluetooth-equip audio player and your work phone. Fashioned for the go-getter that settles for nothing, the Eclipse is the lightest of the bunch and despite its nimbleness, it doesn’t compromise on sound quality, design or comfort. This smaller earbud uses EarGels to keep the device snug in your earlobes but being so light, there will be times that you’ve forgotten you have them in. Fitting the same HD sound quality and active noise cancelling in the Eclipse, sacrifices some space and subsequently, Jabra has omitted any buttons on the sleek alternative. Interactions instead come by double tapping the headset, allowing you to make a call – further functionality options can be sought on the Jabra Assist app, allowing you to see the full options of settings there. Carrying around the Eclipse won’t be a burden either, as the carrying case doesn’t just serve to store it; doubling as a portable charger as well. It’ll give you 7 hours of charge but keep in mind you’ll probably keep it with you since the headset only gives you 3 hours of talk-time. Saving the most active earbuds for last, the Sport Pace Wireless was envisioned for the pace setters who enjoy having their tunes with them while hitting a sweat-filled route. Once you’ve gotten your set, you’ll find a booklet inside that will give you access to the Jabra Sport Life app, a fitness coach of sorts, spurring you on while you exercise. Embracing your workouts will be easier and the app will provide training statistics to keep you motivated. Studies have proven that our moods are heightened or lowered depending on what’s playing in our ears, thus a good playlist paired with these wireless earphones should set you on the right track. Rapid charge is enabled and within 15 minutes, you’ll get back 5 hours of music playback. Decked out with an IP54 rating (the same on the STEEL) and passing US military standards, it will stand up against harsh winds, rain, sweat or impacts. Managing a 21.6gram weight, this is the heaviest of the four but with all its internals, that’s pretty much expected. These are the retail prices of the four devices: You can find all these devices at ALL IT, Harvey Norman, Machines and Viewnet Computer Systems."

Indifferent,  Xiaomi  has always been affordable but have stepped up their game with their recent releases, though they haven’t forgotten their loyal customers – priced almost at a reasonable mid-range, Malaysians can now get their hands on the  Redmi Note 2 . A phablet that carries a 5.5-inch Full HD screen (1920 x 1080), a vast improvement from its predecessor that only had a 720p display. It’ll run a MediaTek Octa-core Helio X10 processor and be mated to 2GB of RAM. Malaysians will get the smaller 16GB model but regardless, the smartphone has a microSD expansion slot for extra storage space. Its internals prove that this mid-range is no push over, since releasing with the same processor found in some higher-priced devices such as the  HTC One M9+  and the  Sony Xperia M5 . The Redmi Note 2 will arrive with a 13-megapixel camera with phase detection auto focus and LED flash, while the front gets a 5-megapixel lens. The design of Xiaomi’s latest device has understated similarities with its smaller Mi 4i flagship, in terms of look and feel. However, internally there are many differences – no unibody design, a dual-SIM 4G LTE slot and also a removable battery (just to name a few). Unlike its old-guard, it’ll receive the greatest 802.11ac Wi-Fi support and have an IR Blaster, that allows you to use it as a remote control for your household devices. Even while being lighter, thinner and smaller than the model it replaces, the phablet has a 3060 mAh battery underneath its matte back cover. The charging port will maintain a traditional micro-USB slot. Pre-orders will be available from the 11th of November, the 160gram phablet will retail for RM 649 and run the latest  MIUI 7  on top of Android 5.0 out of the box.

The Samsung Galaxy View which was  teased earlier on  is a gigantic 18.4″ tablet that runs on Android. This isn’t your typical Android tablet and it even comes a kickstand at the back.  According to Samsung, this opens up new ways of consuming mobile video and entertainment. And possibly they are trying to create a cross product between a TV and a tablet.  The display does Full HD resolution in 16:9 aspect ratio, which gives it a rather low 119ppi (pixels per inch). Since it is focused as a video consumption device, it also gets a pair of stereo speakers and underneath it runs on a 1.6GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. On-board it gets either 32GB or 64GB of storage with the option to add more via a microSD slot. For video conference purposes, it has a 2.1MP front facing camera and if you need to use it while on the go, it has a 5,700mAh battery that’s rated to last 8 hours of video playback. There’s also Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi 802.11ac and a NanoSIM slot (LTE Version) for your connectivity needs.  While it is considered a portable Android device, the Galaxy View is quite a heft at 2.65kg and overall it is 11.9mm thick. The kickstand doesn’t seem to be foldable but Samsung still claims that it is versatile for either a stand mode or typing mode, when placed lying down.  The Galaxy View runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop but the interface is said to be a video-centric one that primarily showcases video content. If we can sum this up, this is basically a tablet+TV hybrid.  This isn’t the first time we’re seeing such products as Acer too has a similar device with the  Aspire Z3-700 . That was basically an all-in-one computer that can could be used as a tablet.

Making the device smaller, this time 5-inches, it carries an AMOLED display with a FHD resolution and has Gorilla Glass 3 plastered on top for protection. Repeating the usage of the Snapdragon 801 on their latest device, it’ll see only 32-bit processing, something that was acceptable on the OnePlus One but causes some concern looking at the latest crop of devices popping up. Continuing the trend, it has the same amount of RAM too, 3GB; which in this day and age, still holds up fine, though there’s only 16GB of expandable internal storage. In the past none of their models had a microSD slot, so this might mean that OnePlus could include expandability in the future devices. Changing it up this time around, they’ve added a hybrid dual-SIM functionality, that gives you networks up to 4G LTE but keep in mind you’ll have to do without one SIM slot for your expandable storage. Its rear camera lens is a 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture sensor, while the front gets an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. All the power is provided by a 2,525 mAh battery and there’s the same three tier alert slider found on the higher-end OnePlus Two. The Onyx version retails for US$ 250 (RM 1,076) and the Ceramic version goes for around US$ 400 (RM 1,721). Only the former is sold in the States but otherwise they retail in the same countries worldwide. Sales will start in India on November 5th using the invite system but only for a month, after which it’ll be available for purchase without strings attached – this strategy will be mimicked across all continents.  No word when the device will hit Malaysian shores but it has already been spotted on  SIRIM , so you can anticipate it to arrive by year’s end. We don’t think the Flagship Killer 2016 was a killer at all, the company which at first was painstakingly trying to keep up with demands of some 2 million reservations, may have left customers waiting too long; they probably opted for other devices by now, seeing a sudden surge of flash sales and our own Maxis selling the device  outright  without an invitation needed. Can OnePlus last long enough to put out their version of the 2017 Flagship Killer? [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

Though, the lesser-known manufacturer has its own niche which it occupies; large battery capacities – at least evident on their P5000 (5350 mAh) and P8000 (4,200 mAh) models. But what does the Vowney bring to the table? If the title didn’t catch your attention, the rest just might. The Vowney (an odd name choice) has a 5.5-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) display, while a 64-bit 2.2GHz MediaTek Helio X10 is behind the smartphone’s brains. It’s also supported by a massive (flagship standard) 4GB of RAM and 32GBs of expandable internal memory – this device packs a huge punch. The specs doesn’t stop there, as this device also boasts LTE connectivity in its dual-SIM slots, NFC and even a fingerprint scanner on the back. Also found on the back is a 21-megapixel Sony sensor equip with Phase Detection Auto Focus and 4K video recording capabilities. Flip it over and you’ll see an 8-megapixel sensor up front. Weighing only 156grams, you can expect this device to not have a full metal unibody but it does have a 4000 mAh battery inside. It starts shipping on the 20 th  of November and will be available for pre-order on its  international website  for only US$ 290 (RM 1,238). Seemingly, it appears that once the pre-order is over, the device will sell for US$ 360 (RM 1,537), so make sure you decide quick. So far, in terms of specs the device has almost no compromise but we’ll let this Android 5.1 running device be officially tested before jumping to conclusions. It’ll be interesting to see if Elephone manages to disrupt the market but are users ready to adopt something so foreign to them?

Alexander Wong,Paying too much for broadband? A new disruptor wants to offer 100Mbps below RM70/month,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/30/can-myrepublic-offer-cheaper-100mbps-broadband-in-malaysia/,"100Mbps Broadband,Broadband,FTTH,High Speed Broadband,HSBB,michael lai,MyRepublic,MyRepublic Malaysia,Unifi","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-10-30,"The cost of broadband has always been a hot topic among Malaysians. Even with TM’s new Unifi plans that offer  faster speeds for less , many had frown upon the removal of its cheaper 5Mbps option at RM149/month.  For those with the need for speed, it can get ridiculously expensive. Maxis offers  100Mbps broadband  for a colossal RM398/month. Alternatively, TIME is also  offering 100Mbps  at a cheaper RM179/month but it comes with a 100GB cap.  Is there a way for Malaysians to get faster speeds at lower prices? A Singaporean broadband company wants to make it possible when it comes to Malaysia.  MyRepublic that’s based in Singapore has caused quite a stir by offering 1Gbps of fibre internet for as low as S$49/month (about RM150) during its debut. It was a deal you can’t refuse as the other players were charging as high as S$395/month (about RM1215) for the same speed. It didn’t take too long before the existing incumbents started slashing prices to match MyRepublic’s offering.  Even today, MyRepublic is offering  2x 1Gbps connections  for home users at only S$59.99 (about RM185) per month. On top of that, they are also coming up as the  4th mobile telco  in Singapore, with unlimited high speed quota. Apart from Singapore, they are also in  New Zealand  offering as high as 1Gbps at NZ$89.99/month (about RM261).  As reported by  DigitalNewsAsia , MyRepublic is planning to enter Malaysia with the ambition to offer 100Mbps connectivity for around RM60-RM70 a month. Its CEO Malcolm Rodrigues wants to be very disruptive in the market and they are eager to take up the disruptor role in our local scene. The timing however depends on our regulatory environment, and they are looking forward for TM to open up its network access by 2016.  At the moment, other fibre broadband players such as Maxis and P1 are tapping onto the same HSBB network as TM but they are basically wholesale deals which isn’t ideal for MyRepublic. In their expansion into Malaysia and other markets, they had  hired Michael Lai , who is the former CEO of P1 and TM Net.  Can MyRepublic disrupt our local broadband scene? 100Mbps at RM60/month sounds insane especially when TM charges double for a mere 1Mbps ADSL service. If Maxis could deliver  10Mbps  from as low as RM118/month, undercutting TM’s UniFi service on the same network, it won’t be surprising.  Like most new ventures, they could offer broadband below cost just to rake the numbers in. For example When telco 3 entered Australia, they had offered loads of free calls, heavily subsidised device offers and lower barrier to entry even for foreign subscribers in order to pull the masses onto their fold. Can MyRepublic make a difference in Malaysia? Let us know what do you think in the comments below. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Alexander Wong,Huawei Mate S: Can Huawei play the premium game?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/27/huawei-mate-s-malaysia-hands-on-first-impressions/,"Android,Dual Sim,first impressions,huawei,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S First Impressions,Huawei Mate S Hands-on,Huawei Mate S Malaysia","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-27,"Huawei is certainly a brand to watch out for as they are rising to the occasion with some compelling smart phones these days. On the Huawei P8, they had elevated their build quality perceptions with a premium unibody metal design, but it isn’t as refined as its mainstream rivals. Perception isn’t built overnight but more consumers are beginning to accept the new wave of alternatives coming from China. To show the world what they are capable of, Huawei had recently announced the  Mate S , a premium device that eyes for the likes of the Galaxy Note 5 and the iPhone 6S Plus. Can they deliver? Read on to find out. At first glance, it looks like a bigger honor 7 with a full metal back that comes with a subtle curve. Upon picking it up, you’ll notice the finer details and the silky smooth surfaces that are nice to touch. Their previous P8 flagship was solid in the hands but the Mate S adds more refinement to the mix. At 7.2mm thin, it is slightly thicker than an iPhone 6s at the thickest point, but the sloping back gives a thinner feeling device at your fingertips. Looking towards the bottom, it shares the similar design as the Huawei P8 and the honor 7, with twin speaker/mic grills on each side of the micro USB port. On the left, you’ll find a dual-SIM tray slot, which is a hybrid one that accepts microSD. The volume buttons and power button are neatly placed on the right for easy reach but we felt that the power button could be larger for the perfect feel. The 5.5″ Full HD screen dominates the front with minimal clutter as it uses on-screen buttons for navigation. During its global launch, the Mate S was Huawei’s first smart phone to feature a “Force Touch” display that’s pressure sensitive but it isn’t present in our current unit. That apparently it reserved for its higher-spec model that comes with 128GB of storage. Underneath, the Huawei Mate S shares a lot of similarities with the honor 7. It runs on a high-end Kirin 935 Octa-Core 64-bit processor (2.2GHz x4, 1.5GHz x4) that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board the mate S comes with 64GB of storage for Malaysia and it is expandable up to 128GB using microSD. With EMUI 3.1 that runs on top of Android 5.1.1, it runs rather smoothly without any hesitation so far. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera with a 4-colour RGBW sensor that’s assisted by dual-LED flash and Optical Image Stabilisation. Similar to the P8, it gets a variety of modes including Light Painting features. The Mate S gets a new Professional Mode that offers full manual settings for extra tweaks on ISO, Manual Focus, Exposure and AWB. For taking selfies, the front gets a 8MP camera that even comes with a soft flash light for brighter looking selfies. Despite being a 2015 flagship, the main camera doesn’t support 4K videos, shooting a maximum of up to Full HD 1080p. The single down facing speaker is quite loud but the biggest feature for audio has got to be its recording capabilities. The Mate S has 3 mics in total which can be used simultaneously to record a meeting conversation with individual attendee tagging, similar to the Galaxy Note 4. In the battery department, it packs a 2,700mAh capacity unit which is slightly more than the P8 by a slight margin. Unlocking the Mate S is rather quick with its rear mounted fingerprint scanner. It unlocks instantly with a touch and it does more than just securing the device. Similar to the honor 7, you can swipe downwards to view notification. On top of that, it performs double duty as a touch pad scroller in the image gallery as well as a remote trigger when taking pictures using both main and selfie cameras. Despite not having a pressure sensitive display, the Mate S still gets a decent amount of gesture features. Apart from the usual tap to wake, it has an improve Knuckle Sense technology that lets you screen capture or crop using your knuckles. Huawei has improved it further with a quick app launch feature where you can draw a “c” using your knuckle to launch the camera or “e” to open a browser. At RM2,698, the Huawei Mate S is also the most expensive smart phone and it goes neck to neck with the Galaxy Note5 that’s priced at RM2,699. For a quick comparison, the Mate S has the upper hand with double the storage at 64GB along with the option to add more with a microSD slot. However the Note5 offers more in specs including a faster processor, more RAM, faster camera and also a productive S Pen. If performance and productivity is what you’re looking for, it is tough to recommend the Mate S over the Galaxy Note5. The decision is even tougher considering the similar spec’ed albeit the smaller screen honor 7 can be have for just RM1,399. However if you’re looking for a stylish and premium alternative that isn’t a Samsung or an Apple, the Mate S could be something worth checking out."
Arif Lee,Malaysia gets a blast from the past as HTC finally releases the One M8 EYE,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/27/malaysia-gets-a-blast-from-the-past-as-htc-finally-releases-the-one-m8-eye/,"Android,Duo Camera,HTC,HTC M8 Eye,HTC Malaysia,HTC One (M8),HTC One M8 Eye,HTC One M8 Eye Launch,launch,official,Price,smart phone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-27,"In an unprecedented move, the Taiwanese mobile manufacturer has brought the  One M8 EYE  to Malaysia – more than a year after it’s been released in other Asian markets. Doc Brown for one would surely reserve a “Great Scott!” for moments like these. The makers said that “in light of the increasing demands in the mid-range segments,  HTC  is bringing on its renowned One series”. Does it make the cut, a full 4 quarters later? It’s been 10 months since we saw the One M8 EYE on  SIRIM ‘s listing, leading us to believe it would’ve been launched in timely fashion but we guess 10 months was short enough for the smartphone manufacturer. Essentially, the same metal-clad flagship (One M8) but receiving some changes in the camera department on the rear. So that removes the infamous Ultrapixel Duo Camera on the back, replacing the mediocre main camera with a 13-megapixel lens. The front is maintained at a 5-megapixel lens. Everything else about the device is the same. To recap, the device is a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, it runs a 2.3GHz Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, and is coupled with 2GB of RAM. There is also just 16GB of internal storage but that’s easily mediated with the available microSD slot. Offering one of the most distinctive audio experiences, the typical HTC BoomSound speakers are present here too. Although a latecomer, it still has 4G LTE available in the form of a nano SIM slot and runs Sense 6 on top of Android 5.0. It also comes with a 2,600 mAh battery to keep it running. Priced at RM 1,399 (w/ GST) it could possibly still give other devices a run for the money; but then again, it’s a year old. If you’d like to pick it up, head over to a major retailer to take a closer look at the Gunmetal Grey version. Would you bother?"
Arif Lee,Huawei Mate S launches in Malaysia: the brand’s most premium smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/27/huawei-mate-s-launches-in-malaysia-the-brands-most-premium-smartphone/,"affordable,Android,EMUI,EMUI 3.1,force touch,G8,huawei,Huawei G8,Huawei Malaysia,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S launch,Huawei Mate S Launch Malaysia,Huawei Mate S Malaysia,Huawei Mate S price,Huawei MediaPad M2,Huawei Price,IFA,IFA 2015,Knuckle,Knuckle Sense,launch,Mate S price,MediaPad M2,Mid-Range,official,Price,smartphone,Tablet","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-27,"When a company strikes the right rhythm, it takes a while before it goes off beat; making its name in the Chinese market and even overtaking Xiaomi in market share, the Huawei name has recently started its global expansion. Among their successful launches, the latest would be the  honor 7 , in  London  and the  Nexus 6P  in a partnership with  Google . Can they break the stigma associated with Chinese manufacturers? Backed by the Huawei  Mate S , they just might. Targeting a new market, as compared to its predecessor, it was launched at  IFA 2015  with “Force Touch”, we won’t be getting that 128GB model but nonetheless, the Mate S is no one trick pony. It boasts a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and a familiar combination makes its way underneath the metal-only outer layer of the device; a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM. There will also be 64GB of internal memory, while its expandable through the hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slots (up-to 128GB). Its photographs are taken by a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera equip with OIS and dual-LED flash; the front however gets an 8-megapixel shutter with an f/2.4 aperture and a single LED flash. Huawei’s signature rear fingerprint scanner is included here too for an alternative option for biometric security. In terms of software, Knuckle Sense gets an update, now version 2.0 and as per usual, allows you to interact differently through your knuckles in the form of double-tapping or drawing symbols. You’ll also notice EMUI 3.1 skinned over Android 5.1 Lollipop on the device. A 2,700 mAh battery fits inside the 156gram smartphone and will be available in two colour options, Prestige Gold and Coral Pink. The Mate S makes a big price jump as the newest edition to the Mate lineup; retracing back to the launch price of the Ascend Mate 7, it went for RM 1,999 during its launch. But, for the price you pay, Huawei wants to make it worth your money by adding these perks: And depending how early you decide to buy the device, the more you’ll get in return. Lest we forget, you’ll have to fork out RM 2,698 (w/ GST) for the Mate S, so be warned and make sure you have enough money in the bank. Having felt the device in our  first impressions , we can say that the chamfered edges with 2.5D glass and metal build might be just enough make you favour the Mate S. Utilising the classic, oh “by the way” we have another (two) product(s) to show you technique, Huawei also launched the  G8  today, a good-looking mid-ranger that just supplements the theory of the manufacturer playing the premium game; along with their new flagship tablet, the  MediaPad M2 8.0 . The former is a also a 5.5-incher with a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has the same 2.5D glass edged glass but has a slightly less metal make at 90% composition. Fittingly as a mid-ranger, it has a 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage (expandable). For imaging, the G8 gets a 28mm wide-angle 13-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 5-megapixel lens on the front. Akin to the Mate S, the more affordable G8 also has a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE slot but has a larger 3,000 mAh battery. Mirroring its big brother, it also has EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop for its operating system. Onto the largest of the trio, the Huawei MediaPad M2 8.0, that as the name suggests, has an 8-inch screen with the same FHD resolution (1920 x 1080). Under the hood, it houses a 64-bit Octa-core 2GHz Kirin 930 chipset and for multitasking and app switching, there’s 2GB of RAM. As a tablet, the readily available 32GB might be a stretch but at least there’s a microSD slot for expandability.  An 8-inch device being used to take photos might be a sight for sore eyes but if you really need to, there’s an 8-megapixel rear camera; used more practically for video calling a 2-megapixel sensor will be on the front. Touted to “amplify your excitement” the tablet will offer a seamless audio experience, thanks to its side-facing dual speaker set-up. Utilising Clari-Fi technology and Super Wide Sound 2.0 by Harman Kardon, the brand promises to immerse you with 180-degree surround sound. Wrapping up, the tablet will have 4,800 mAh of battery to keep the 310gram device running and it’ll also have a single 4G LTE slot for cellular connectivity.   The G8 and MediaPad M2 8.0 both retail for RM 1,499 (w/ GST) and are available in these colour options: Grey or Silver – G8 and Gold – MediaPad M2 8.0. The two smartphones will be available from today onwards, and be sold across all Huawei stores nationwide but you’ll have to wait till late November to get your hands on the tablet.

A big change for  Apple , since they’ve maintained LCD panels across all their mobile devices so far. It’s quite surprising who they allegedly reached-out to supply their newer displays. These amazing displays already live on their wearables, the  Apple Watch ; with the OLED display supplied by non-other than  LG . The Korean manufacturer has been at the forefront of commercial OLED technology, incorporating them into their TVs, as of recently. Subsequently, Apple may lean towards another supplier/competitor ( Samsung ) if they’re considering to bring the same screens to their bigger devices. Facing a tough pickle in the form of relying on one another, Apple and Samsung have never been too cosy; if you remember the tennis match of lawsuits going across the two. But realistically, Apple needs Samsung (and vice versa) to produce their great devices. Hardware from one end gets used on the other, a win-win situation for both parties and the  chip-gate issue  might not cause a rift after all, if this source is true. What’s so great about OLEDs, compared to the rest? Well for one, LEDs and OLEDs both work by transmitting light but the latter is more efficient by operating as the sole lighting source, as well as providing the colour; LEDs only provide the white back light (if you’ve come across screen bleeding, this is why). Other than screen bleeding it gives other perks as well: There are always trade offs with innovation and you can read about the shortcomings of OLEDs  here . OLEDs / AMOLEDs have seen a higher adaptation rate in today’s market, and it’s clear that they provide a superior viewing experience. Apple could be easily testing their on devices with the better displays behind the curtain but don’t think that they’d let the cat out of the bag so easily. 
Would you hope on Apple hopping on OLEDs so soon? Let us know in the comments below. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"

The new Nexus 6P is made by Huawei and it is their very first device carrying the Nexus banner. It gets a 5.7″ Quad HD display that does 518 pixels per inch and powering the internals is a 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. There are 32GB and 64GB storage options which are not expandable. Like the  Nexus 5X  by LG, it carries a 12.3MP f/2.0 main camera with dual-LED flash and Laser AF. It supports 4K video recording as well as slow motion capture at 240fps. For selfies, the front gets a 8MP f/2.4 shooter with a larger 1.4 micron pixel size.

This cuts out Digi’s widest  claim  by 5% and will bring great news to all smartphone users on the Maxis network. In Q3 alone, Maxis allocated RM 359 million to increase its LTE coverage nationwide. Exceeding 55% of the current population of Malaysia, now allows them to hold the widest 4G LTE network title in the country. That accounts for 95% of coverage across key market centres and 60% in all state capitals. Serving their 9 million internet users, the telco is aware that as more people get on their data network, a higher need will surface to provide a faster and wider network for all. Adding 1.5 million 4G LTE customers in only a year, it’ll be a challenging task for them to keep up with the average 2.3GBs of data used per user. The telco is anticipating to spend roughly RM 1.2 billion to RM 1.3 billion on CAPEX for 2015, ensuring that they can mediate any high data traffic that will arrive with more customers.

Operated officially by Apple, you get the full experience from its product showcase, genius bar and workshops to help you use your products better. As part of its expansion, the Cupertino company appears to be opening its very first store in South East Asia. Pure Fitness, a gym in Singapore has recently informed its members that they are shutting down its Knightsbridge outlet on Orchard Road. This move apparently is to pave way for a new Apple Store that’s set to open in 2016.  Apple has yet to issue any formal announcement but it shouldn’t come as a surprise as they have been  searching for a prime spot  along Orchard Road. And to clear any doubt if this is another authorised reseller, the notice had specifically mentioned “Singapore’s first Apple Store”. Currently the closest Apple Stores around us are located in China with 20 stores, Hong Kong with 4 stores, Japan with 9 and 22 in Australia. Since Singapore has been among the first wave countries to receive the latest iPhone, iPad and even the Apple Watch, it is about time for the little red dot to have its own official on ground presence. For the crazy first adopters in Malaysia, you now have a new place to  queue up  on the eve of launch day.  [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  Image Credit  ]"

After being  spotted  in certification databases of both Malaysia and Singapore, this is likely to be the official launch of the  Redmi Note 2 , with sales expected to commence shortly after. 
 According to the official invite, the launch event will announce the product availability for four markets namely Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. To recap on the specs, the Redmi Note 2 is an affordable phablet that could be priced below its mainstream competitors. It features a 5.5″ Full HD display, a MediaTek Octa-Core Helio X10 processor, 2GB of RAM and likely 16GB of storage for our local market. The Redmi Note 2 also comes with an expandable microSD slot, 13MP f/2.2 main camera with PDAF and a front facing 5MP selfie camera.  On top of that, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi and comes with an IR Blaster which can be a nifty remote control. Keeping the lights on is a removable 3,060mAh battery that supports quick charge. Out of the box, it runs on its latest MIUI 7 that’s based on Android 5.0.  Like most new devices today, it supports dual-SIM with 4G LTE. Dimension wise, it is 8.25mm thick and weighs 160g, which is more compact than the original Redmi Note. In China, the 16GB storage version with dual 4G LTE is priced at 899 CNY, which is about RM602. With the fluctuating currency exchange, Xiaomi might be pricing this higher but we have a hunch that it should be below RM700."

Being hard hit by drops in oil trade prices due to an excess of supply and micromanaging the qualms of 1MDB, our Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak has a lot on his hands – if that wasn’t clear enough. But will the ICT market win or lose when Budget 2016 is read? In terms of ICT services, this year’s speech talked about ramping up internet access for non-urban locations from 5Mbps to 20Mbps, spending RM 1.2 billion – we’re unsure how far reaching this project will be but some areas in Rawang have yet to receive UniFi; please make your own deductions based on that. Our Prime Minister also finally puts the prepaid GST issue to bed, by saying that if you’re local, your GST charges will be rebated back to your account starting from the 1st of January 2016 – leading us to believe that they’ll issue you a monthly statement so you can redeem your credit back; this is merely speculation on how the telcos will credit back your payments but wait for the official notice once it gets out. This brings great news to those who have been feeling the pinch on their prepaid top ups.  Also, just to recap prepaid top ups will be GST  exempted  from next month onwards (1st November) – e.g. a RM 10 topup will cost you RM 10. Instead, GST will be charged upon usage . UPDATE : Prepaid Reloads will  continue to be sold  with 6% GST until 31st December.  In any case you paid attention to LAST YEAR’s budget, the MoF at that time said they’d implement high-speed broadband in high-impact areas, areas around state capitals and other major towns nationwide. We’d like to know if you felt that providers have upped their game if you live in or around Klang Valley; also, please share your views on how this budget will affect Malaysians. [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

Meanwhile the ZenPad 8.0 is the bigger sibling of its current ZenPad 7.0 that also offers a wide variety of customisable back covers.  Following the success of its current  Zenfone 2  series, ASUS is stepping up its offering with a upmarket Deluxe Edition that comes with a unique polygon design back cover. Underneath, it gets the same internals as its  high spec ZenFone 2  that tops at 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.

In last week’s 2016 Budget announcement, all Malaysian prepaid users will be entitled for a  rebate on GST . This will take effect starting 1st January until 31st December 2016. With this new development, all reloads will still be sold with the extra 6% until 31st of December. The new directive of charging GST upon usage, instead of reloads will only take effect starting 1st January 2016.  As for the GST rebate for prepaid users, the mechanism isn’t clear at this point. We’re guessing each telco would issue a monthly statement which you can use to redeem your GST rebate. Hopefully the rebate back to your account balance would be an automated process.

In recent times, we’ve seen  Huawei  churn out some premium phones, at a fair price –  Nexus 6P ,  honor 7 ,  P8  and the  Ascend Mate 7 . Now can their main competitor, Xiaomi follow suit? Leak photos of the Xiaomi  Redmi Note 2  Pro might be the company’s first stab at an all-metal smartphone. Released earlier in August, the Redmi Note 2 is a 5.5-inch device equip with a FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display. Inside, it gets a flagship worthy MediaTek Helio X10; an Octa-core processor clocked to 2.2GHz – also on the HTC One M9+ and the Meizu MX5. There’s also a decent amount of RAM (2GB) and internal storage (32GB) in its 160gram polycarbonate body. 
For its photo-taking purposes, it makes use of a 13-megapixel f/2.2 lens that comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus capable of 0.1 focus speeds. It’s secondary front-facing camera is a 5-megapixel shutter with beautification software built into the camera app. Providing the juice to all these components is a 3060mAh battery and it runs on MIUI 6 that is upgradable to  MIUI 7 , when they start the Global  roll-out . The Redmi Note 2 currently retails in China for 999 CNY (RM624). So what differentiates the Pro from earlier talked about Redmi Note 2? It is rumoured to feature a meta-clad build and also a rear fingerprint scanner. There’s also a likeliness that MIUI 7 will be available out of the box when it goes on sale. Please note that these are leaks and should always be taken with a pinch of salt but if this is the direction Xiaomi is heading in, we could see their new devices carrying more metal in the near future. How well will these Chinese brands manage in reaching out to the high-end market ? Once a brand’s identity has been established, it’ll be tough to shake off and making a new name for themselves just adds another burden. Do let us know what you think of these brands attempting to appeal to the more premium consumer in the comments below. For a closer look at the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, head on over  here .

They’ve butt heads with  Samsung  before, in a long-drawn-out battle of ping pong, each taking turns to  sue  each other. When the first leaks of the  HTC One A9  came around, we too thought it was an iPhone clone but lets take a look closer at how Apple “innovates”; methods that haven’t settled well with their Taiwanese counterparts, causing one of HTC’s regional chiefs to share his two cents on the subject. Jack Tong, President of the North Asia had this to say, after the One A9 press event: A worthy case made by Tong; you’ll see what we mean when you compare the backs of the  HTC One M7  and the  iPhone 6 , which the former came into existence first. At the time of its instillation, the M7 was a device veered for its use of a metal unibody, to the extent that HTC kept the design language three times over –  M8  and  M9 . Similarities between the iPhone 6/6s (since they look the same) and the HTC One A9 may be uncanny but if you take a look at the (earlier released) HTC One M7 and M8 compared to the Apple iPhone 6, yeah its the same thing.   iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus 
HTC One M7 pictured on far left He then adds that: All this finger pointing as said earlier, isn’t Apple’s first rodeo when considering the presence it has associated with pioneering in the tech industry – heck they’re even rumoured to be entering the automotive business. When you take a look at the how the Cupertino brand markets themselves, you’ll know that people tend to think that the iDevices were the first smartphone and tablet. What of the tablets that ran Windows XP, or near field communication (NFC) tech distinctive and finger print sensors native to Japan? Both of which lead the pack way before Apple decided to hitch a ride on the same train. We could go on about what came first but do they get the credit? We feel that limelight stealing in general will continue forever. A leaked photo has given HTC executives some powerful ammunition to hand down to their underlings: Whether the market reacts positively or otherwise, we’ll have to wait but HTC is surely embracing all the free advertisement it’s getting. One thing we can be sure of is that the Taiwanese manufacturer will continue to stick to the design on the One A9; as quoted by Tong, it’ll eventually spill over to their top of the line M and Desire models.

Their latest venture in question is field-testing Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) on their 4G LTE network. 
 Boldly claiming to provide the  widest 4G LTE coverage , capable of connecting every 1 in 2 Malaysians, Digi seeks to add more value to their services by adding VoLTE to their repertoire. Data speeds have forever been a topic of discussion amongst Malaysians, especially those who rely on their smartphones. But have we forgotten that phones were made for us to actually talk to each other? Well having said, there hasn’t been a large emphasis on call quality, since the whole experience has been fairly satisfactory, albeit some drop calls every now and then. With VoLTE these issues might soon be a thing of the past, resolving it by delivering voice calls over the 4G data network. Currently “sedentary” to be made over 2G and 3G networks, imagine having voice calls through 4G networks – will there be a difference, you ask? Ever been in an LRT and your coach is screaming away and you can’t hear the person on the other end? Well in theory, VoLTE will transmit high fidelity audio and add noise cancellation features to your calls. That means a lot more talking/listening and a lot less shouting/closing one ear to hear clearly. VoLTE will also allow users to bridge the gap of internet use while active in a voice call; giving you 4G LTE speeds whilst in both uses. Presently, you’d notice that your network switches from 4G to 2G/3G when making a call? Yup, that’s the clear example. Another benefit would be faster connection to the other end, possibly 2-3 times faster to get you connected to the person you’re calling. Digi implementation of testing is already happening behind the scenes and their subscribers can expect to make use of the better call quality on their 4G LTE enabled-smartphones next year. 2G and 3G voice calls are still enabled after the launch of VoLTE for whoever has a non-4G LTE device. Head on over  here  to take a look at how call quality is improved using different voice-over technologies. Drop us a comment below to tell us what you’ve experience while talking on your device, especially when it concerns call quality and dropped calls."

To date, their Kickstarter has managed to collect US$ 230,000 pledges, exceeding their goal of US$ 100k and they still have 17 days of funding to go. In a convenient easy to use package, the accessory comes in 3 parts: In the first place, ideally we’d prefer if you’d stay away from your smartphones while driving but the accessory would be a great deterrent to the whole situation. Placing your phone on the cradle, and usage of the HUDWAY app (iOS & Android), will enable you to see whats on your screen, merely flipped to mirror that actual image on the special reflective display. Currently, the makers have used the iPhone 6 Plus, as a benchmark for the size of phones, so anything bigger than that might have an issue fitting – bigger than 158 x 77mm, length and width respectively. The team plans to add these functionalities to the HUD display if they manage to hit their stretch goals: In Malaysia, our always sunny days might impair the clarity of the display (or rather your phone’s display reflected). So driving during the daytime while having the HUDWAY on your dashboard, you might not see everything clearly, but larger objects shouldn’t be an issue. Another problematic issue would be your phone overheating due to direct sunlight from being on the dashboard; they’ve put out frankly that this might be a problem and their accessory is passive, so there won’t be any temperature sensors or cooling elements. Let us know what you think of the HUDWAY dashboard car accessory, is it worth it? [  SOURCE  ]"

The gradual OTA roll-out will see it serve part of the 150 million users who own the same Mi devices that are currently supported on their open beta. The exact models that are capable of handling the OS will be announced only nearing to the launch but if you own any of the following, you should be safe: We say so because they were the devices that were allowed to beta test MIUI 7. The aforementioned skin will include new UI Themes, performance improvements, sleep wake-ups and even child mode. For an extensive look at the new operating system, head on over  here  for more. This custom ROM may awkwardly leave some models unchanged of their main Android version, so if you were running KitKat, your model might stay that way but some within the line-up might upgrade to Lollipop. An odd proposition for users who’d prefer to upgrade the normal way but it seems that core MIUI features should reflect the MIUI 7 upgrade. Eager owners who can’t wait a week can take their chances by trying  this  Chinese port of the MIUI 7 ROM, that’s available to test on non-Xiaomi smartphones as well (proceed at caution, this is a port not an official release). Those who’re on the list said previously, can still decide to test the waters on the official beta variant of the Global ROM  here . Once the official release is out, you’ll be able to find the file  here , that’s if you can’t wait for the OTA. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Alexander Wong,iOS 9.1 update brings smarter Live Photos and more Emojis,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/22/ios-9-1-update-brings-smarter-live-photos-and-more-emojis/,"apple,iOS,iOS 9,iOS 9 features,iOS 9 Malaysia,iOS 9 Update,iOS 9.1,iOS 9.1 Malaysia,iOS 9.1 Update,iPad,iPhone,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Plus,iPhone 6S,ipod touch,Upgrade iOS 9","Apple,iOS,iPad,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-22,"If you’ve gotten an  iPhone 6s , one of the newest feature is Live Photos. It basically takes a moving picture which include seconds before and after a shot is being taken. Problem is, most of the time it capture moments of you lowering your iPhone which is natural for anyone to do when taking a normal picture.  This minor annoyance has been fixed with the new iOS 9.1 which is rolling out now to current iOS 9 devices. From the changelog, the updated Live Photos should intelligently detect when the iPhone is being lifted or lowered, so it knows when to start/stop recording at the right time. It also brings a fresh batch of 150 Emojis for all your social and messaging needs.  The iOS 9.1 update weighs about 313MB and you can download it over the air (OTA) via Settings > General > Software Update. It is recommended that you do this over WiFi to save on mobile data.  Apart from the Live Photos fix and additional Emojis, the update also improves a couple of bug fixes that cover Music, Photos, Safari, Search, Calendar, Contacts and Mail. It also improves the performance for Multitasking and some issues of viewing zoomed content apparently has been sorted out.  Going back to Live Photos, while it is interesting at first, it is quite gimmicky as you can’t share those  videos  moving pictures to your friends. Furthermore it consumes double the storage space as it creates another MOV file weighing about 3MB each. Fortunately you can disable this at anytime by tapping the icon next to the HDR button, and we recommend you to do so especially if you’re having a paltry 16GB version."

The latter re-imagined how we saw the future and how to appreciate the present but also gave us a look at what power-lacing shoes would look like, party thanks to Nike. Providing a non-powered replica; the first Air Mag in 2011 for charity, Nike filled a US Patent on the 8 th  of July 2014 to create the actual thing and now we have it or at least Michael J. Fox does. If you’re not sure what this whole thing is about or have little to no knowledge of Sci-fi pop-culture, yesterday, the 21 st  of October 2015, was the date that Doc and Marty travelled to in the movie  Back to the Future Part II . And while the sneakers did make an appearance during the movie back in 1989, they weren’t the real deal; as the prop makers ran some wiring through the lead actor’s pants enabling the laces to tighten themselves. Looking exactly the same on the outside, the latest Nike Air Mags now have a powered mechanism somewhere in its bottom sole that tightens the laces for you once you’ve secured your feet inside and for us normal people, there’s a manual option if the batteries run out of juice.   Similar to the 2011 version of the sneakers, the 2016 consumer release will be produced in limited quantities through open bidding and again all proceeds will be channelled to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. With this innovation Nike hinted at the possibility that one day these power laces could make their way on other sneakers from the brand. “creating something for fiction and turning it into fact” to quote the manufacturer’s CEO, Mark Parker. Here’s a short animated parody of the movie scene when they time-travel to the future. In the crazy scenario that you have, let’s say 5 figures of spare change lying around, feel free to bid during the auction and show off your Nike Air Mags II; we’ll just take the nostalgic route and go on a BTTF marathon.

Looking at the images so far we can tell you that it isn’t a sore to look at, proving that Samsung isn’t taking design for granted even if the  Galaxy View  is touted to carry mid-range specs. A noticeable change from the Korean manufacturer is the omission of the home button, a physicality that’s been present on all previous tablets they’ve made. They opt instead for the more natural on-screen buttons that you’ll be able to see below. On the back is where things get a whole lot more interesting. The attachment comes in the form of a kickstand, which has a handle. The photos don’t reveal how its held together, if there’s a locking system or otherwise but it does show that you’ll be able to display it in a higher or lower orientation depending what you’re using it for. Here are the alleged specs of the Galaxy View: One of the photos shows a front facing camera for video calls, showing that the  GFXBench  listing could hold true. Samsung has yet to issue a comment but manufacturers rarely do when things leak accidentally. We’re hopeful that more info eventually comes to light about this gigantic tablet, who knows? Samsung might still have some tricks under its sleeve. [  SOURCE  ]"
Arif Lee,The Huawei Mate S costs as much as the Galaxy Note5; would you buy it?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/22/the-huawei-mate-s-costs-as-much-as-the-galaxy-note5-would-you-buy-it/,"force touch,huawei,Huawei Malaysia,Huawei Mate S,Huawei Mate S launch,Huawei Mate S Launch Malaysia,Huawei Mate S Malaysia,Huawei Mate S price,Huawei Price,Huawei SIRIM,IFA,IFA 2015,Knuckle,Knuckle Sense,Mate S price,Price","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-22,"We’ve all known that Huawei would tie up with Google since earlier this year and that’s probably catapulted the brand’s name worldwide; since their moniker is more widely known in Asia than Western markets. Associated mainly with affordability and decent specs, they’ve steadily moved towards manufacturing premium handsets – seen on the  Ascend Mate 7  and  P8 . Ahead of the official launch scheduled next week, Lowyat.NET has gotten an insight at how much and which model we’ll be getting. So what makes the  Huawei Mate S  worth RM 2,698 (w/ GST)? The Mate S was marketed during its launch to feature  “Force Touch”  on its 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, but sadly we aren’t getting that model locally (yet?). So what gives? Why the premium price tag that could almost have anyone easily pick up TWO 16GB  honor 7 s? More so when it looks almost identical despite some contrasting characteristics. Under all that premium metal sits a Kirin 935 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and if those words ring a bell, you’re right if you said that it’s the exact same combo found on the honor 7. The full line includes a 32GB and 128GB version but here we’ll get the gap between, a 64GB model that supports a hybrid dual-SIM 4G LTE/microSD slot up to 128GB. Flipping the phone over, you’ll see a 13-megapixel RGBW rear camera with OIS and a dual-LED flash module. Move over on to the front and there will be an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor greeting you for all your selfie needs. Unique to only the P8 previously, Knuckle Sense makes a return, now updated to a 2.0 version. A feature that is able to tell the difference between your finger tips and your knuckles; handing you extra gestures by double-tapping or drawing letters to give access to app functionality. Juicing its engine is a 2,700 mAh battery that has quick charge on board. The Mate S also has a fingerprint scanner under the rear camera module if you prefer biometric security to the usual PIN/password settings. All packaged in an overall weight of 156g that runs Huawei’s own EMUI 3.1 skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop. The device will be available in two colour options – Prestige Gold and Coral Pink To be fair to Huawei, Apple’s crème de la crème  iPhone 6s  has also seen a huge price difference that increases every model, so maybe you can’t put all the blame on the Chinese smartphone maker. Maybe its just the fact that once a brand is recognised for something, it’s hard to shake off and Huawei has always been relatively affordable. Moving with the times isn’t a bad thing but they’ve thrown in some extras to get you on the Mate S team. The list below details what you’ll get together with your new phone: If you jump onboard before the 3,000 mark, they’ll even hand you a bespoke Pewter Membership Card from Royal Selangor; allowing you to be worry free and skip any line at any Huawei Exclusive Service Centres. Too busy to head over? You can also arrange for a delivery and pick-up option for your device’s servicing. Those who want to join the party earlier, or first 1,000 to be precise, will get a complimentary Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) earphones by Huawei. Rounding up, the brand has added some great perks if you purchase the device early but is that enough to convince you? The Huawei Mate S at RM 2,698 makes the  Galaxy Note5  a value-buy or does it?

In the Klang Valley, you get a variety of rides from hatchbacks to sedans and occasionally MPVs/SUVs that could potentially carry more passengers.  For moments when you need a ride for a bigger group, Uber KL has finally introduced UberXL. This is a larger vehicle option that supports up to 6 passengers instead of the usual 4. In terms of pricing, it is cheaper than requesting two UberX rides. The base fare for UberXL is RM2.50 and you’re charged both RM0.40/minute and RM0.75/KM for each trip. As comparison, the standard UberX charges RM1.50 for base fare, followed by RM0.30/minute and RM0.60/KM. There’s no mention of what vehicles are being used but it will definitely fit 6 passengers.  UPDATE : UberXL vehicles include the Toyota Wish, Nissan Grand Livina and Perodua Alza. Using the fare estimator, it would cost around RM18-23 for a trip from MidValley to KLCC while a trip from Sunway Pyramid to KL Sentral costs approximately MYR23-30. For long distance trips, Uber charges a flat rate of RM110 to KLIA and RM160 to Genting Highlands.  At time of writing, the option hasn’t appeared on our app and it could be rolled out in stages.  This is good for lunch with your colleagues or weekend family trips to the mall.  Uber is available to download for  Android ,  iOS  and  Windows Phone . As this is a cashless system, you’ll need to register with a credit/debit card.  [  SOURCE   VIA  ]"

This came to light as Facebook Engineer  Ari Grant  has admitted a couple of battery related issues but he assures that a fix is on its way. There are 2 reasons why this is happening. The first issues is what he calls as a CPU Spin within their network code. Basically it is a repeated process in the background which uses more power than usual. The second problem is how the Facebook app handles audio playback. If you leave Facebook after watching a video, the audio is muted but the session is still active in the background. While it appears that nothing is happening, it continues to consume power in the background. Ari Grant had also assured that the battery issue is not caused by their optional Location history feature. For those who didn’t enable this feature, Facebook isn’t accessing your location in the background without your consent. The good news is that a new Facebook App update addressing these problems will be released later today.  [  SOURCE  ]"

The confirmed spec sheet has listed that the device carries an OLED QHD (2560 x 1440) 5.4-inch dual-edged screen and the brain of the whole package is a Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 with an Adreno 418 handling graphics. It also states that there will be 3GB of RAM, together with 32GBs of internal memory; expandable up to 2TB (when the card exists) through microSD.

There’s apparently a 2-megapixel shutter up front as well but there was no mention on the website when it was  live . A 3,410 mAh battery will power up the Android BlackBerry PRIV (sorry, it was so weird saying that) and they promise 22.5 hours of mixed usage but if you run out quickly there’s fast charging features to save you. The PRIV, which stands for privacy/privilege will weigh in at 192grams and be 9.4mm thick. At RM  3,200  2,966 (converted from USD), this could be one of the most expensive consumer Android devices out there – even surpassing the launch price of the BlackBerry Passport in Malaysia (RM 2,399). Will this redeem the Waterloo based company? Or will it make them continually struggle to hit revenue targets? Well, if they don’t sell  5 million  units of the PRIVs, John Chen might pull the plug on the ailing brand. [ SOURCE ,  VIA   ]"

For starters, it features a large 5.7″ Quad HD IPS Quantum Display which is accompanied by a secondary display that sits at the top right. The 2nd screen is an always on 2.1″ screen with a 160×1040 pixels resolution. Like the Galaxy Note Edge, the secondary display gives you a view of notification, status updates and even shortcuts to your favourite apps. Design wise, the V10 body is reinforced by a SAE grade 316L stainless steel DuraGuard frame while the back and bottom has a softer material that could withstand scratches. In typical LG fashion, it has the power and volume rocker mounted at the back, underneath its main camera.  Under the hood, it gets a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor similar to the LG G4 but mated to 4GB of LPDDR-3 RAM along with a whopping 64GB of storage.

This allows you to capture both selfie or groufie pictures in an instant. In addition to that, the V10 also gets 3 directional mics and you can manipulate the sound source for your video recording in Manual Video mode. For those craving for better sound, it even has a 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC built in. You can read more in our previous  LG V10 announcement post .

The front gets a respectable 5.5″ Full HD display and underneath it runs on Huawei’s in-house developed Kirin 935 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. There’s also 32GB of on-board storage expandable via microSD. Selected markets get larger storage options including 64GB and 128GB capacities but it looks like we are settling for only 32GB in Malaysia. The Mate S gets a 13MP f/2.0 RGBW main camera with Optical Image Stabiliser and dual-LED flash, similar to the Huawei P8. For extra tweaks, the camera app now has professional mode that gives you manual camera settings. For selfies, the front has a 8MP f/2.4 camera that’s assisted by a soft LED flash.  With a pressure sensitive display, the Mate S allows you to do more things such as zooming and previewing with a stronger press. Also not forgotten is their knuckle sense feature that was introduced with the Huawei P8.  The Huawei Mate S is powered by a 2,700mAh non-removable battery and overall it weighs 156g with a thickness of 7.2mm. It runs on Android 5.1 with Huawei’s EMUI 3.1 skin layered on top. In terms of connectivity, it supports dual-SIM slots with 4G LTE.  For Malaysia, it looks like  we’re not getting  the “Force Touch” enabled model. As seen in other markets, the lower standard versions with 32GB/64GB storage lacks the pressure sensitive display and it is only found on the higher-spec 128GB model.  Stay tuned for pricing and availability details as we will be there at the Malaysian launch next week."
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S7 might launch in January 2016. Here’s what to expect,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/20/samsung-galaxy-s7-might-launch-in-january-2016-heres-what-to-expect/,"3D Touch,Android,force touch,Project Lucky,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S7,Samsung Galaxy S7 Launch,Samsung Galaxy S7 Rumours,USB Type C","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-10-20,"With the  Galaxy Note5  and  iPhone 6s  out of the way, Samsung is undoubtedly working full force on next year’s flagship, the Galaxy S7. At the moment, Samsung is leading the Android pack, with benchmark crushing performance and finally a premium build utilising metal and glass materials. So what will Samsung do next for the first half of 2016? Based on what we’ve heard so far, they are introducing a couple of new features to widen its gap against its competitors.  For starters, the Galaxy S7 is expected to use USB Type C, a reversible cable connector that’s supposedly a future standard. Not only it allows faster rapid charge, it also provides faster data transfers even when compared to USB 3.0. New flagships like the OnePlus 2, Lumia 950/950XL and Nexus 5X/6P have already adopted this connector standard and we should be seeing more of these in 2016.  The  Huawei Mate S  has it and so does the latest  iPhone 6s . It was recently revealed that Samsung has patented a  display tech  that’s similar to 3D Touch. This allows it to differentiate the amount of force being applied onto the screen, based on corresponding voltage.  From the illustrations above, the feature allows multi purpose input such as alternating between space/tab and apply upper case when a key is pressed with extra force. It is possible that Samsung might introduce this on their future flagships, and it may or may not be the Galaxy S7.  The Exynos 7420 processor on the Galaxy S6/Note5 is a proven workhorse, churning out insane benchmark figures yet maintaining frugal battery consumption. For next year, Samsung is rumoured to release the Galaxy S7 with up to  3 processor  variants.  The Exynos 7422 which was earlier rumoured for the Galaxy Note5 will is expected to power India based units while a newer Exynos 8890 (also known as the Exynos M1) will find its way to Korea, Japan and European markets. Given a pass for Samsung’s 2015 flagships, Qualcomm appears to be making a come back with a Snapdragon 820 processor. The Snapdragon 820 variant is said to be fitted for China and US bound units. So far there’s no mention of what we’re getting in the South East Asian region.  For imaging, the 16MP shooter on the Galaxy Note5/S6 remains unchanged since the Galaxy Note 4. To bring its photography capabilities to the next level, Samsung could be upgrading to a higher 20MP camera that utilises Samsung’s own ISOCELL sensor. Word also has it that it could carry a dual-camera set up, similar to the HTC One M9+. With the Apple iPhone 6s/6s Plus being announced in September, Samsung had brought forward its Galaxy Note5 launch to August, ahead of its traditional September IFA launch. This gave Samsung an early head start to build up its sales momentum before the iDevices go to market.  For 2016, it appears that Samsung might announce the Galaxy S7 as early as January instead of its usual February/March timeline in conjunction with Mobile World Congress. Similar to its current Galaxy S6, there would be two models – SM-G930 and SM-G935 which carry a standard and a dual-curved display. January is just 3 months away. So if you’re planning to get a new flagship smart phone, would you just grab the Galaxy Note5 or wait for the next big thing? [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  3  ]"

Has their team finally smartened up by listening to its consumers? Nigel Newby-House, their head of product, talks about how the company intends to scale back on their custom UI,  HTC  Sense; bases that have been covered by  Samsung  on their TouchWiz skin, which now is a lot lighter than before. It’ll be a nice change to see HTC change their inclination to focus more on their “truly meaningful” experiences on Sense – BlinkFeed, Zoe, and themes. Engineers will spend less time tinkering with menus and icons and instead be involved in ensuring that Google’s Android updates are pushed out earlier than its competitors. Soon you’ll probably say goodbye to that repetitive email app that they put on their devices, everyone is hopeful that HTC’s mission to make phones less frustrating actually comes to life. Not specific to just HTC, users who own OEM smartphones tend to be flustered by the same problem, since they know that the manufacturers will take longer than other makers to get an update out. We’ve already seen some improvement from HTC, with their promise to deliver “every” Google software update within 15 days of the Nexus line, at least on the  HTC One A9 . U-turning on the Head of Americas  tweet , who said it was an “unrealistic” for any smartphone maker to commit to.   Obviously contextual, we’re not sure how vague “every” means and as pointed out by GSM Arena, there’s bound to be a cut-off moment for support, as always. How far do the boundaries of the update go? Will it cover only certain regions? Lets see if HTC pays any heed to these important questions. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"

In its 5th generation, it gets the best in class hardware that’s encased in a premium metal and glass body. The physical hardware isn’t the only improvement here as Samsung has packed more features to empower you to do more with its  improved S Pen . If you’re still thinking whether to upgrade, head after the break for 10 reasons why. Great ideas come in a flash and you need to jot it down in an instant. With the Galaxy Note5, you can start writing or drawing immediately. There’s no need to launch any apps, just eject the S Pen and you can jot down your thoughts on a blank screen. Now you can keep your favourite apps closer to your fingertips. The floating Air Command for the S Pen now lets you add 3 shortcuts to your frequently used apps. So whichever screen you’re on, you can edit and share instantly.  A picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes a single screenshot isn’t enough. On the Galaxy Note5, you can perform a scroll capture. Just start a screen write with the S Pen, and hit scroll capture to add additional pages to your screenshot. This makes it perfect to share a long web page or a chat conversation up to 22 pages in a single image.   If you want a great display, it can’t get better than this. The Galaxy Note5 gets a large 5.7” screen that pushes Quad HD 2560×1440 pixels resolution. That’s 4x more than the standard HD 720p resolution. Using a Super AMOLED screen, text is much sharper and colours are more vibrant for a more immersive viewing experience.  Writing your notes by hand feels natural and the Galaxy Note5 is able to transform your handwriting to text seamlessly. With the S-Note app, you can jot down your words in any language including Chinese and then transform it to text, based on your keyboard input settings.  The Galaxy Note5 is also smart enough to transform math formulas and even shapes to editable digital formats. All these are made possible with the Extension Pack which can be downloaded for free on the Galaxy Note5.    The Galaxy S6 is already an incredible device for capturing photos and the Galaxy Note5 is no exception. Carrying the same proven 16MP f/1.9 main camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, the Galaxy Note5 is always ready to take the shot in any situation. Whether you’re traveling or at a concert, you can always count on the Galaxy Note5 for excellent pictures even in low light. To capture moments in high definition, you can shoot videos up to 4K UHD. So that you won’t miss a moment, you can always launch the camera app from sleep by pressing the home key twice. Selfie lovers would also appreciate its 5MP f/1.9 wide angle front camera. It lets you take perfect selfies all the time with built-in beautification features. Need a group shot? Forget selfie-sticks and nobody will be left behind using its easy to use wide-selfie mode.  Sharing your moments on social media is fast but now you can share it live as it happens. Instead of shooting a video, you can also start a Live Broadcast directly onto YouTube. If it is a private event, not to worry as you get to invite who to watch your video broadcast that’s streamed up to Full HD resolution. Your friends can watch it live on their smart phones, tablets and even on desktop computers.  The Galaxy Note5 is all about productivity and it runs on a top of the line Exynos 64-bit Octa-Core processor that’s both powerful and energy efficient. To multi-task like a pro, it packs 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM allowing you to run multiple apps simultaneously.  Whether you carry 2 mobile numbers or if you travel a lot, you can enjoy greater flexibility with its dual-SIM slots. Now you can juggle between home and work numbers or have the ability to pop in a local SIM card when you travel, saving you substantially on data roaming cost. Managing between two numbers is easy and you can even set your preferred SIM for Data, Voice and SMS. 
In terms of connectivity, the Galaxy Note5 has no compromises with both slots supporting 4G with faster LTE-A standards.  After a long day of work, keeping your Galaxy Note5 charged is quicker than ever. With adaptive fast charge, its 3,000mAh battery is juiced up from 0-100% in just 90 minutes. For greater convenience, it also supports Fast Wireless Charge that does 0-100% in just 120 minutes. That’s 1.4x faster than conventional wireless chargers. 
The Galaxy Note5 is priced at RM2,699 and it is now available now in 4 colours – White Pearl, Gold Platinum, Black Sapphire and Silver Titanium. If you’re interested to get one, you can check them out at your nearest Samsung Experience Stores or roadshow venues below.

Alexander Wong,HTC wants to beat the iPhone with a phone that looks like one,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/21/htc-one-a9-official-looks-like-an-iphone/,"Android,HTC,HTC One A9,HTC One A9 Launch,HTC One A9 Official,iPhone,Marshmallow,smart phone","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-21,"HTC is in dire need of turning its fortunes around. With the  HTC One M9  not living up to its expectations, their next device has got to be something incredible to make up for lost ground. Confirming our  worst fears , the recently announced  HTC One A9  isn’t exactly the flagship that we’re looking for. Couple of days back, its CEO Cher Wang has  mentioned  that the One A9 is a good alternative to Apple’s new  iPhone 6s . They have probably taken that too literally, as the design is almost identical especially from the back. Of course there are some design changes to avoid being too blatant like the  Lenovo S90 Sisley . Meanwhile at the front, it has a hint of a Samsung Galaxy with smooth edges and a home button which also doubles up as a fingerprint scanner.  In terms of specs, the front gets a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display that’s toughen with Gorilla Glass 4. The front looks cleaner and disappointingly it lacks HTC’s trademark BoomSound front stereo speakers that we liked a lot. Instead it opts for a single down firing speaker that’s similar to the iPhone 6s/Galaxy S6. Under the hood, it runs on Qualcomm’s newer 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 617 processor, with a choice of either 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, or a higher-spec 3GB RAM and 32GB storage version. If you need more, storage is still expandable with microSD up to 2TB.  For imaging, the back camera is a 13MP f/2.0 unit that’s assisted by Optical Image Stabilisation. It supports RAW shooting with one touch enhancement and there’s also a hyperlapse feature to speed up or slow down your action videos. At the front, it still retains HTC’s 4MP f/2.0 Ultrapixel unit for brighter selfies in low light conditions. Despite its shortfall on external speakers, the One A9 compensates by having a HiFi DAC built-in. This delivers 24-bit/192KHz Hi-Res Audio with Dolby Audio™ Surround technology for better enjoyment with some quality headphones plugged-in. On top of that, the One A9 runs on the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box and HTC pledges to update the software within 15 days after the Nexus lineup gets them.  In typical HTC fashion, it gets a smaller than average battery at 2,150mAh that supports Quick Charge 2.0. On the spec sheet, it mentions that  Quick Charge 3.0  will be compatible once it is available officially. Overall it weighs 143 grams and has a thickness of 7.26mm. That’s the same weight as the iPhone 6s but the iPhone is thinner at 7.1mm. The HTC One A9 will be available globally beginning 1st week of November and it is expected to be priced at US$400, which is about RM1,718 with our current exchange rates. Overall, this isn’t a flagship to challenge the likes of the Galaxy S6 or the Xperia Z5.  With a premium metal build and a mid-range hardware, the HTC One A9 is looking like Samsung’s Galaxy A series that offers a premium build quality at a more affordable price range. Even the One A9 naming convention does seem to mimic the likes of the  Galaxy A5  and  Galaxy A8 . HTC is pushing this as a design centric smart phone and the One A9 gets a range of colourful options including Carbon Gray, Opal Silver, Deep Garnet and Topaz Gold. For half the asking price of the  iPhone 6s , HTC might be up to something but you probably can get better devices like the Galaxy S6 that isn’t much more expensive than its purported RM1,718 price range.  Does the HTC One A9 appeal to you? Let us know in the comments below."

The  Microsoft Surface Pro 4  is the  ultimate tablet  that can replace your laptop, which is now thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever. Targeted for  November release , you can secure yours today by placing a pre-order on Lazada. With our weakening Malaysian Ringgit, the Surface Pro 4 costs more than its predecessor from RM3,999. That’s more expensive than last year’s Surface Pro 3 that’s  priced starting  from RM2,729. For Malaysia, we are getting the following models and they are priced as follows: Despite its more expensive price tag, the Surface Pen is strangely omitted, which was previously a standard bundle on the Surface Pro 3 . The new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is available in only Black and Blue, without a fingerprint scanner. You can read more about the Surface Pro 4 in our  announcement post . In comparison with the US pricing, Microsoft Malaysia is selling the Surface Pro 4 higher than anticipated. At US$899, the base model should cost RM3,794 (RM4.22) but it looks like they have marked up the price to buffer any possible changes. That’s quite a lot to pay for a tablet that comes with no keyboard included. If you prefer to get it on ground, retailers such as Harvey Norman, All IT Hypermarket, PC Image, Senheng, SenQ, SNS Network, Thunder Match Technology, Viewnet and Microsoft KLCC Store will start accepting pre-orders on 26th October.

Obviously having the company’s optics guy talk to you about how the camera performs isn’t exactly the best way to deliver a product without some favouritism but let’s see the photos first. While the post was fairly in-depth, it probably explored the parts where the Lumia shined – 5 photos in different lighting situations and highlighting different aspects of the phones cameras’ features. Listing out the bare specs of the cameras; Going off a limb by saying that the cameras has the same dynamic range as an SLR and “HDR is rarely needed”. Alakarhu adds on another paragraph how the Lumias are unmatched in low-light shots and how much of the difference the 5 th  gen OIS and large aperture makes in the images. In the low-light shot, two photos are compared, one from a competitor looking extremely grainy/noisy and the other looking much better. He then talks explains the Rich Capture mode, a feature that takes two exposure moments for the same image – taking in the short for any movements and the long for whatever is stationary. If it works as promised, it’ll allow you to tweak the amount of light in a shot, whilst using flash too. For flashes it’ll take one with and one without, while the three tone flash will appropriately balance out the colour balance to produce a more real life characteristics. It’ll be hard to say if there was any post-production touch-ups done on these images, though for the third photograph, Alakarhu does state that an external reflector and lighting were used for this image. Windows 10 will be on these devices, and they’ll have Continuum compatibility once hooked up to the Display Dock, shown  here . Time will tell if Windows Phones can resurrect the name of (Nokia) Lumias.

With full access to Google Play Store apps, the Blackberry PRIV should be more appealing to the masses than its current BlackBerry 10 based smart phones. To give a better idea of this BlackBerry + Android combo, the Waterloo company has just released its first PRIV video starring its very own Blackberry Hub. Being a slider device, it gives the best of both worlds featuring a full touch screen and a QWERTY keyboard which also doubles up as a trackpad, like the  BlackBerry Passport .

For photography, it carries an 18MP main camera that’s Schneider-Kreuznach certified and the front carries a 5MP shooter. The battery is officially listed as a 3,410mAh capacity unit which should provide more than a day’s worth of usage.  The BlackBerry PRIV is expected to be available in November and they had also started a  registration of interest  drive on their website. From the video, it looks very stock Android with a couple of BlackBerry services integrated right in. For those already using Android, you should feel right at home.

A worthy companion for anyone that might need to rid their devices of incriminating data in a jiffy. Created by the researcher known as “Dark Purple”, this USB stick comes in the form of a regular USB thumb drive but in no way does it store bytes. This cyber weapon sends 220 volts through its USB interface to your plugged device shorting your whole circuit before you can say “destroyed.” The interface of the USB Killer can be switched to act as a malware stick but that removes the spy element from it, self-destructing would have more appeal for sure. Info from a blog post by the man himself, claimed that his creation could permanently impair “almost any equipment” as long as it had a USB slot – crippling newer TVs, routers, modems and the works. Little to no details have cropped up except for the aforementioned amount of voltage it sends through the USB circuit, or discharges the capacitor quickly. Fresh news crops up after its initial time of fame in March but there’s now a video showing the device being used on the researchers own laptop. The Russian ends by saying that although it seems like the laptop he was using is now “dead” it’ll be brought back to life once a simple motherboard switch is made. So the likeliness of the hard drive being affected is slim at best; why bother then if it only disables the motherboard and not wiping data in the process? Nonetheless, it’ll still keep users cautious not to simply plug in random USB thumb drives lying around. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"

Arif Lee,Fresh news shows Moto X Style is coming to Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/19/moto-x-style-certified-in-malaysia/,"Android,Malaysia,Moto Maker,Moto X,Moto X 2015,Moto X Pure Edition,Moto X Pure Edition Malaysia,Moto X Style,Moto X Style Malaysia,Motorola Malaysia,Motorola Mobility,Motorola Moto X,Motorola Moto X Pure Edition,Motorola Moto X Style,SIRIM,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Motorola",2015-10-19,"Q4 is now in full swing, bringing some hopeful news to Motorola fans in Malaysia. A week ago, we’d already  seen  the  Moto X Play  make its way onto our local electronic certification board; now its bigger brother, the  Moto X Style  does the same. Initially announced back during the end of July, these two hopefuls could attempt to disrupt the local market providing two sizes to appeal to different users. The two will be joined by the existing  Moto G , that fills the most affordable range among the three. The flagship of the Moto line, is why we’re here today and by chance that you haven’t heard of its specifications, the Moto X Style/Pure is the largest at 5.7-inches. Its screen is a QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution IPS display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top. Under the hood, you’ll get a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808, coupled with 3GB of RAM for all your processing needs. The manufacturer’s decision to stray away from the top of the line Qualcomm chipset would point to not wanting to have the burden of dealing with the heating issues that have plagued other smartphone makers. Although it has an option for a MicroSD card (up to 128GB), the base model has 16GB on board, while there’s a 32GB and 64GB variant as well; no word on which we’ll be receiving here. It’s sad to see that manufacturers are still not realising that 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore on smartphones, a trend that has seen Apple stick with the base 16GB for its own  iDevices . For your photo-taking needs, it’ll sport a wide-angle 21-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture that’s capable of shooting in 4K resolution. Flip over to the front, you’ll see a 5-megapixel shutter with its own flash module. A worthy mention when considering its camera optics, which earned it a top 4 (based on points), sharing the spot with the  LG G4  – at least by  DxOMark’s  standards. Connectivity-wise, there’s Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, NFC and 4G LTE Cat6 for speeds up to 300Mbps. Those who want to have dual-SIM functionality might have to give the Style/Pure a pass, since it only supports a single nano SIM. The device is also rated at a certified IP52, meaning it’ll be water repellent. All of its internals will be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery that has Turbo Charging, which claims to get you 10 hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging and it’ll run a Motorola enriched version of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. As a rough indication, the device retails for US$ 400 (RM 1,684) – 16GB, US$ 450 (RM 1,895) – 32GB and US$ 500 (RM 2,105) – 64GB in the States. Brightstar will be the ones bringing this over, but no word on availability and pricing has come to light yet. We’ll keep you updated if there’s any news on these devices. Thanks to Ephemeral for pointing this out."

Alexander Wong,TM refreshes its broadband offering with new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/15/tm-refreshes-its-broadband-offering-with-new-unifi-advance-plan/,"All new Unifi,HSBB,TM HSBB,TM Unifi,Unifi,UniFi ADVANCE PLAN,Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-10-15,"Today marks a change at TM with a new website and refresh of its high speed broadband offering. Branding wise, the Unifi logo remains unchanged since its inception but its online presence has been revamped with a store-like design for easier online application.  With calls for faster and cheaper broadband, TM has revised its broadband offering with its new Unifi ADVANCE PLAN which claims to pack the best value in the industry. For starters, the new Unifi home plans come in just 2 options – 30Mbps and 50Mbps. This essentially is the same “new” plans  we’ve seen before  but with reduced subscription fees. The TM Unifi ADVANCE PLAN with 30Mbps is offered at RM179/month instead of RM199/month, and if you need 50Mbps, it can be yours for RM229/month (before GST). By default, you get HyppTV as standard which comes with HyppTV Aneka or HyppTV Varnam Pack for free. You also get a DECT Phone bundled in but calls are now charged separately at 20 sen/min to all local numbers including mobile. For those needing unlimited calls to fixed lines like its former VIP plans, you can opt for the Voice Pack that costs RM20/month.  In terms of speed, the 30Mbps plan gives you 30Mbps download while uploads are at 5Mbps. For RM50/month extra, you get 50Mbps download with a faster uplink of 10Mbps. So if you’re an existing VIP 10 customer enjoying 10Mbps for both download and upload, your next upgrade should be the ADVANCE PLAN with 50Mbps download and 10Mbps. Essentially you’re getting 5x the download speed while the upload speed remains unchanged.  TM insists that its Unifi packages are competitively priced against its competitors. With Maxis jumping onto the fibre broadband business, it had caused a stir with its cheaper 10Mbps offering from as low as RM128/month. When compared on the same speed of 30Mbps, Unifi appears to pack more value considering it includes HyppTV and you get a fixed line with the option for unlimited calls at RM20/month. For enterprise users, they have a similar offering with its Unifi BIZ ADVANCE PLAN. The base 30Mbps plan with Dynamic IP starts at RM259/month (Normal: RM299/month) and you have the option to upgrade to 50Mbps at RM50/month extra. There’s also Simple Voice Plus Plan for free fixed line calls at RM30/month and there are more add-ons for MS Office, POS systems and surveillance services. Like the Home plans, the 30Mbps offering comes with 5Mbps upload while the 50Mbps option gets 10Mbps upload.  Strangely TM has removed its lower 5Mbps, 10Mbps and 20Mbps Unifi packages of old. While the new Unifi ADVANCE PLANS might offer higher speeds for less, it doesn’t really address the concerns of affordable broadband. When we did a  quick search , it seems that the 30Mbps/50Mbps plans have limited coverage areas and if you’re not covered, it suggests that you take up Streamyx instead. Perhaps they should consider introducing a cheaper 5Mbps option without the extra bells and whistles instead. For more information, head over to the new  Unifi page ."
Alexander Wong,Compared: iPhone 6s Telco Offers in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/14/iphone-6s-malaysia-telco-price-comparison-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile/,"Celcom,Comparison,Contract,DiGi,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Celcom,iPhone 6s Digi,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Malaysia Comparison,iPhone 6s malaysia contract,iPhone 6s maxis,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6S Price,iPhone 6s Price Comparison,iPhone 6s U Mobile,Maxis,Postpaid,U Mobile","Celcom,DiGi,iOS,iPhone,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-10-14,"Another year and another iPhone has finally arrived. The  iPhone 6s  will be available in Malaysia officially this Friday, 16th October at 12:00AM. If you’re looking to buy one on contract, it is available from all 4 telcos namely Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile. This is the fastest iPhone 6s roll out yet for Malaysia and it is also the most extensive in terms of contract options. With U Mobile coming into the picture, they have shaken things up a little with its lower commitment plans and an interesting Microcredit financing option. For Maxis, it still retains the same iValue Plan offering that comes with bundled calls, text and SMS. However for those who make lots of phone calls, they are also making its MaxisONE Plan available as well. Celcom on the other hand has the simplest approach with just 3 FIRST plan options that come with its OPTIMISER feature.  Last but not least is Digi where they are bundling the iPhone 6s with their new SmartPlan that can be have with either more data or more voice and SMS. In terms of contract duration, majority of the plans are on 24 months with exception for Maxis and Digi where they do have 12 months option for selected plans.  So which telco should you go for? We’ve gathered the plans and device pricing from all 4 telcos for your easy reference. Check them out after the break. For consistency, we compared the permanent non-promo bundles from each plan with its pricing without the 6% GST. Do note that the above minimum cost of ownership is just a guide and it is based on the assumption that you don’t incur additional usage on top of what has been included with the plan. On Maxis, they are giving 1GB extra for 6 months on its highest MaxisOne 188 plan. On top of that, they are also giving  4 months  of additional 1GB for 4G LTE use only for the MaxisONE Plan as well.  Digi on the other hand is giving 2GB of extra data for 12 months in conjunction with its current  Smart Plan promo . Following closely behind is Celcom where they are giving 1GB extra of free data for 12 months.  During sign up, most of these telcos would require an upfront payment, which is basically like a deposit that would be used to offset your upcoming bills. For U Mobile, they do offer a waiver for the advance payment but you’ll need to pay the device by credit card and sign up for their auto-debit billing feature.  Before committing to a plan on contract, it is always recommended to pick one that suits your needs. The iPhone 6s is obviously cheaper on the highest plan and you might end up paying more than what you actually need. Apart from the calls, SMS and data offering, there are other things to consider such as network quality, customer service and other value added services including international roaming. For those who can’t afford to pay so much upfront, U Mobile offers the flexibility with Microcredit which you can determine its duration and amount. However do note that this works like a personal loan and there’s an interest of approximately 1.2%. As usual, if you spot any errors in the table above, do let us know in the comments above. Considering the iPhone is more expensive than before, getting one with a telco contract would garner more savings provided that you get the right plan. However for those who prefer to get it outright, an iPhone 6s is  priced officially  from RM3,199 for the base 16GB model. Below is the full iPhone pricelist in Malaysia right now:"

Putting yourself in this stressful situation tenfold won’t do any favours for your health, so Google has decided to ease that burden off your shoulders for a bit by adding lane guidance for Malaysian public roads. Featured on the Maps app (pre-installed on Android) but available  here  for iOS, the add-on helps you stay on the right lane so no missed or wrong exits are taken in the process. No longer will you have those last second moments to switch from the opposite end of lanes just to make it to where you’re heading to. Accessing the lane guidance is similar to just using the turn-by-turn Navigation already present on the application. Type in your location and tap on the Navigation icon to get voice assisted directions with lane guidance. Do note that Google mentioned that it’ll cover MOST public roads but be prepared that it might not support wherever you’re heading to, at least not yet. Knowing them, they’ll continue to add to the existing roads already supported to ensure Malaysian can rest easy while travelling and paying (more expensive) tolls. [  SOURCE  ]"

Although, not officially on the Play Store yet, the APK is from WhatsApp devs themselves, so there shouldn’t be any issues with the update. So what do you need to do to get it running? It’s not rocket science and anyone who wants to have this on their Android devices can just follow these steps. Step 1 
Ensure that your device is set to allow installations from “unknown sources” 
Head on over to your Settings > Security > turn on “unknown sources” Step 2 
Head on to  WhatsApp’s official website  and download the APK file 
Install the file Step 3 
Now you have the feature available but you’ve got to enable it manually 
To do that, open your WhatsApp > the three vertical dots on your top right > Settings > Chat and calls > Chat backup > Back Up Here you’ll be able to choose whether you want to include your videos with that backup and how often you’d like the backups to be done. A great feature for all Android users who have multiple smartphones, it gets the nod thanks to Google Drive’s APIs that gives permissions to developers, hence offering the ability to users for this backup option. If you’re not too keen on getting the APK, you’ll have to wait until the official update comes to the Play Store, which quoting Google, will only roll out “soon”. It’s about time this came to the Android half of things, considering iOS has had their iCloud backup for quite some time. [  SOURCE  ]"

LG G4 owners in Poland will begin receiving their M upgrade beginning next week with other markets in Europe, Asia and the Americas to follow.

Yet, information still seems to be up in the air, from an earlier rumour of a MediaTek chipset, to it apparently features a Snapdragon 801. In timely fashion, three certification organisations have given OnePlus the go-ahead;  SIRIM ,  TENAA  and the  FCC . Aesthetically, we’re not quite sure how to feel about this design, as it looks a lot like the iPhones of old and the  OPPO R1x . Rumours aside, the two sets of photos from TENAA and FCC lessen some doubts about what the device will look like. This report however states that the device will carry a 2,450 mAh battery instead of the 3,000 it was  earlier  thought to house, fueling speculation that this indeed is just a mid-range device. For its dimensions, it’ll apparently come in 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm form factor – at least based on TENAA’s findings. Do note that the model listed is is labeled as the ONE E1001, compared to Malaysia’s listing of E1003; higher ending number probably means a higher spec model. So there’s a chance that its internals might be different from our local set. Otherwise, you’ll find the same notification slider that they’ve added on the OnePlus 2. Will this mid-ranger help OnePlus recoup some of their fans, who feel that the company hasn’t kept up with demands? We’ll have to wait and see. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The waiting game has struck Malaysia ever since the first crazy line for the  iPhone  4. Madness ensued across all telcos who’ve never braved such mammoth crowds when they first started. But now Malaysians are utilising different means to get their hands on their much beloved Apple smartphones, and it doesn’t always involve queuing up from daybreak. It’s safe to say that all the telcos have gradually firmed up their skills to handle the looming army that waits passionately for their  iDevices . So what do these buyers brave when waiting in line? Well that all depends on where they are: Celcom  has their Blue Cube setup at Sunway Pyramid, an outdoor area that could spell rain for those who choose that location. Foreseeing a rather wet occasion, Celcom has again raised some canopies to battle the chance of torrential downfall and to generally keep their customers comfy. Food and drinks were served here for those who wanted to get their hands on a Celcom iPhone. Frankly, we think it looks like a carnival. The kicker for Celcom, if you’re lucky enough, one of the celebs present will pass you your device, they’ll even deliver some of the sets to your houses themselves. The star studded list includes: Scha Alyahya, Amber Chia, Ella, Awal Ashari, Hani, Soo Wincci & Shaheizy Sam. Digi  on the other hand chose to hold their launch at their SS2 branch, which means rain is likely to damper hopes of the people in queue as well. This year they’ve enlisted help from some food trucks (for free meals) and gave out numbers (for those who queued), so they can linger around till 11:45 pm before heading back to the line. The night in SS2 is quite bustling so there’s no shortage of things to keep you entertained while you wait. U Mobile  takes advantage of their HQ in Berjaya Times Square, which makes it indoors (well kind of, under the huge cover of Time Square’s front lobby) and safe from any weather conditions that might take place in our unpredictable climate. Those who have a sweet tooth would certainly enjoy the Krispy Kreme doughnuts and coffee provided by the telco. Maxis  always has theirs at KLCC, this time around the line starts outside the actual selling floor but drinks and finger food was provided to those in line, while there were more options once you headed inside. The (pre-order only) line here hasn’t quite built up yet, possibly meaning that most of their customers opted for the delivery/pick up option. Here’s  a break down of all the telco plans compared for those who aren’t already in line. Now that we’re talked about how the wait for the devices were across all four telcos, let’s talk about what Malaysians could be preferring to do instead. Scalpers get excited at the opportunity to jack prices up, if there’s demand. Are Malaysians choosing to buy from these individuals instead? Or have they decided to head on over to Singapore to get their hands on an SG set? It boils down to if you’re going to be disciplined enough to travel back to our neighbours down south for your warranty, if anything were to happen to your Apple product. For scalpers, its mainly down to luck, or if you purchase from places like Lazada, we’ll hope that they fulfill their end of providing warranty coverage. Then you have those who’d rather wait for the storm to end and get their devices hand-delivered to them while in their comforts of their homes. You’ll get to choose from Maxis, Digi and U Mobile, so quite a wide array to choose from. So you tell us, have you ever been in these types of lines in the past? Do you think you’ll be in one anytime soon? Do let us know in the comments below."
Arif Lee,FCC gives us an early look at OnePlus’ upcoming device,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/12/fcc-gives-us-an-early-look-at-oneplus-upcoming-device/,"Carl Pei,co-founder,fcc,FCC certification,Mini,OnePlus,OnePlus certified,OnePlus FCC,OnePlus Malaysia,OnePlus mini,OnePlus USA,OnePlus X,SIRIM,X","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus,Rumour Mill",2015-10-12,"Late last week, the OnePlus E1003 showed itself on  SIRIM ; divulging little to nothing – SIM setup, Wi-Fi and cellular band support details. Dubbed the “X” from the Shenzhen based manufacturer, Carl Pei stated that this new smartphone would be the company’s take on a beautifully designed device, rather than its usual “Flagship Killer” tune. But from the photos we’ve seen, it’s safe to say that Mr Pei is slowly veering into the realm of delusion. Those who love/hate the brand have come accustomed to the co-founder’s antics – e.g.  Samsung internship . Sharing his thoughts on the holiday-season ready OnePlus X during an interview with USA Today, Pei said that it was tough choosing between the OnePlus 2 and this new device. Seems like he liked how the old iPhones used to look. Rounded on the top and bottom, the OnePlus X looks almost identical to an iPhone 5 or an  OPPO R1x . Supporting documents to the FCC show that the unreleased smartphone will run a 1.9GHz processor, at least on the E1005 variant. It also adds to SIRIM’s details that it’ll have LTE on board and the photos imply that it’ll use a USB Type-C connector. Rumoured reports have gone to state that it’ll retail for only  US$ 250  (RM 1,035) and have a MediaTek Helio X10 processor under the hood, along with 2GB of LD-DDR3 RAM for performance related-task. Considered a mid-ranger of sorts, it’ll apparently sport a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and feature 32GB of internal storage that is expandable through a microSD card. It’s purported to house at least 3,000 mAh of battery and have NFC capabilities. Otherwise, its camera is rumoured to be a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that can get you up to 4K video recording and a 5-megapixel shutter rounds off the front. Has OnePlus run out of ideas? Their “aesthetically pleasing” X model doesn’t scream any innovation or sense of design. Tell us what you think of the leaked OnePlus X and your thoughts about Carl Pei in the comments below. By any chance, you would love to get a OnePlus 2 on your hands (without an invite and totally free), head on over to our friends at  theSkop , who are giving away one with a complimentary Otterbox case to protect your device. Thanks again to  Felix  for the tip! [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The back is made of aerospace grade aluminium alloy with ceramic sand blasting effect for a more upmarket feel. To provide a comforting grip, the back has a subtle curve, while the power and volume keys are within easy reach.

You can use it to control your TV, DVD Player, Projector, Air Conditioner and even SLR cameras if supported. So if you misplaced your remote or if it is out of battery, you have the honor 7 to the rescue.   A great device needs to be backed up by excellent warranty and support. In addition to the standard 1-year warranty, the honor 7 gets 6-months free one to one exchange warranty which comes with an exclusive free pick up service. If the screen gets damaged, honor is also providing a 6 months LCD Crack protection for greater piece of mind.

In conjunction with the productivity software launch, the Asia Pacific division of the Redmond natives carried out a survey to gauge how working professionals in 10 countries adapt to their work-life. Finding a middle ground for most working professionals is definitely tough task to approach. Somewhere in between the hustle of our work lives and our personal time the line differentiating the two is slowly becoming smaller and smaller. The Malaysian workforce seem to agree and want access to the tools necessary to complete their work-related tasks regardless of their location – based on Microsoft Asia Pacific’s “New World of Work” survey.

Given their recent troubles, this will be a make or break device(s) for Japanese company; with the  Z5 line  has the potential of being their saving grace. The three devices are slated to make an official appearance in Malaysia on the 29 th  October during this special invite-only event (you can sign up  here ). If you’re lucky enough to score yourself these exclusive invites, you’ll be in store for some lucky draws, giveaways and door gifts.   Seen on SIRIM ( Xperia Z5 Compact ) earlier last week, it’ll be great to see how 4K will be illustrated in the form of the  Xperia Z5 Premium . Also, all three will make use of Sony’s latest 23-megapixel sensor that won it the best smartphone camera by  DxOMark , hopefully giving the other camera-ready flagships a run for their money in real-life situations. Sony smartphone camera sensors have always been top class, as seen on other notable flagships but the Japanese company seems to lag behind in the image processing department. The smallest of the Xperia bunch, the Z5 Compact will only command 4.6-inches of screen-estate in the form of a 720p (1280 x 720) resolution. While its internals utilise the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor found on its bigger brothers, it only has 2GB of RAM. For your storage there’s 32GB internally but you’ll get a microSD slot to expand up to 200GB if you want to. As mentioned earlier, it’ll come equipped with the same camera sensors as its bigger siblings; 23-megapixels on the rear and 5-megapixels on the front. As the smallest of the three, it shows itself in four playful colours; Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral. The middle-child, the Xperia Z5 sports a larger and denser 5.2-inch FHD display (1920 x 1080). Similarly, it’ll have the 810 SoC, 32GB of internal storage and feature the same camera setup but come with 3GB of RAM and a 2,900 mAh battery instead. Saving the best for last, the Xperia Z5 Premium will include the first-ever 4K (2840 x 2160) 5.5-inch screen – if you did the math, that’s about 806 ppi. A screen of such caliber has to have a camera capable of matching the output, so the aforementioned 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS Sensor with a f/2.0 lens is capable of shooting 4K. UPDATE : Sony Malaysia will be launching the Xperia Z5 Compact Dual, Xperia Z5 Dual and Xperia Z5 Premium Dual.  Other than its larger 3,430 mAh capacity battery, there’s not much that sets it apart from the Xperia Z5. All three support LTE networks and could arrive in a dual-SIM variant on our shores but if you’re relying on SIRIM, the Compact model listed only shows the singular SIM. However, the two larger devices aren’t shown, so maybe they might be dual-SIM capable.

Alexander Wong,TM teases something ahead of iPhone 6s launch. What could this be?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/10/tm-unifi-15-october-teaser-launch/,"Broadband,High Speed Broadband,HSBB,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM Unifi,Unifi","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-10-10,"A week before the  iPhone 6s  lands officially in Malaysia, TM has teased 15th of October as the day of change. What is a broadband company like TM doing ahead of probably the most anticipated phone launches of the year? Without saying much, the “Apple”-like tweet continues with “The smartphone unlike any other needs a broadband unlike any other.” Could it be a new mobile service? Although there are plans to roll out  full fledged mobile 4G LTE  service in  the near future , it’s probably not since it mentions “broadband”. What we do know is that TM has been experimenting with new  broadband packages  as of late and that could be a start for something bigger. We’ll have to wait until next Thursday, 15th October to find out more. What do you guys think?"
Alexander Wong,TM drops more clues for its 15th October reveal,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/13/tm-drops-more-clues-for-its-15th-october-reveal/,"Broadband,High Speed Broadband,HSBB,Telekom Malaysia,TM,TM Unifi,Unifi","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-10-13,"Earlier on TM has teased us that  everything is going to be changed  on 15th of October. As we are just 2 days to go, TM has released its  new microsite  which gives us a tiny bit more clues on what to expect on the actual day.  Again toying with the notion of launching a smart phone, the new site reads “A breakthrough device enhanced with Unifi” with the claim of providing the best broadband experience for your device. Scrolling further down, the page emphasises on 3 things – unlimited experience, unmatched choices and unbeatable value. In terms of current Unifi broadband, we are still getting unlimited quotas and this is expected to remain unchanged for the time being. As for choices, we’ve seen TM introducing more HyppTV channels and  newer plans  that offer faster download speeds for less. Is TM going to respond to the competition with even faster speeds and affordable subscription? We really hope to see that this coming Thursday.  What’s interesting is the area of Mobility as shown above. TM has the spectrum to operate a 4G LTE telco but we feel it is too soon for them to go live at this point of time. Furthermore, the site has been consistently talking about broadband rather than a mobile network. Perhaps it is an extended internet services from its TMgo 4G LTE broadband or its newly acquired P1 subsidiary that runs on WiMAX.  At the bottom of the page, TM invites you to register your interest on whatever they are going to launch and you’ll stand a chance to win a smart phone. No smart phone models were mentioned but since TM is announcing this closely to the iPhone 6s, they better be giving that away after all that teasing. You can check out the Microsite yourself over  here .   [  SOURCE  ]"

Ghost Push is apparently hard to get rid of as well, already causing havoc on 900,000 devices so far in 116 countries (Malaysia is the 7 th  hardest hit on that list). Discovered by the team at Cheetah Mobile aka the people behind “CM Security”, they’ve been monitoring the malware since September 18 th . No manufacturer has managed to resolve this issue by themselves, so it’s best you do your research on how to remove it once you’re infected. Cheetah Mobile has noticed that this malicious code can slip pass Google’s Play Store security and possibly attain full root access of your smartphones and tablets. Here’s a small list of apps that have been discovered to have Ghost Push onboard. Through the full control access of your devices, these Chinese hackers have been forcing app installations behind your backs. CM has a rough estimation – $4 million/day. Google has since pulled the infected apps from the Play Store, but similarly in the past if you’d already been infected, the Trojan won’t just disappear with a simple app update/reinstall. Opportunistically, Cheetah Mobile has now made available an app to detect the malware on your Android devices.

Well apparently if you can connect every 1 in 2 Malaysians, it’ll earn you the title. Digi has managed to surpass their 45% network coverage year-end target by 5% and their network is currently able to support that 50% of the population on their high-speed internet service. It doesn’t just stop there, as they plan to further their rollout by an additional 1,500 cell tower sites by the end of 2015 to increase their already wide network. Words from Digi’s CEO, Albern Murty says that Digi has expanded their “4G LTE coverage to reach 28 major cities and secondary towns nationwide.” Their 4G networks are now able to support the 1800MHz and 2600MHz base bands. Obviously more spectrum bands allow wider coverage and it’ll help both indoors and outdoors too. So far in the past 3 years, the yellow themed telco company has spent RM 2.3 billion in CAPEX (capital expenditures), with the funds mainly going to its networks. Additionally, they’ve set aside another RM 900 million for this year to increase their network strength for Malaysians.

Alexander Wong,U Mobile offers more data and financial flexibility to own the iPhone 6s in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/10/u-mobile-offers-more-data-and-financial-flexibility-to-own-the-iphone-6s-in-malaysia/,"Flexi U MicroCredit,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6s U Mobile,U Microcredit,U Mobile,U Mobile iPhone 6s,U Mobile Micro Credit","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-10-10,"The big 3 telcos – Celcom, Digi and Maxis have revealed their iPhone 6s plans. If you take a glance at all 3, they are the same old postpaid contract approach where you fork out a hefty sum for both device and advance payment. For U Mobile, they are offering  similar plans as before  but it gets more generous quotas and greater flexibility to make owning an iPhone 6s easier.  Could this be the best iPhone 6s deal in town? Read on to find out. For starters, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are offered with their iPlans, offering Voice, SMS and data all-in in either postpaid or prepaid. The lowest option is their i40 plan that comes with 1.5GB of data, 40 minutes of calls and 20 SMS to all networks for just RM40/month. If you commit RM20/month extra on i60, you’ll get 5GB of data, 60 minutes of calls and 30 SMS. For any excess usage, all calls are charged at 5 sen/30 seconds and 3 sen/SMS to all networks For the hardcore users, the higher i90 (RM90/month) and i130 (RM130/month) plans both offer unlimited phone calls and they come with 7GB and 10GB of data respectively. This is probably the closest plan to their recent  P70 Hero Postpaid  offering. Overall, U Mobile appears to be the most generous with data among the 4 participating telcos.  If you have an existing device, you can  trade-up  hassle free with U Mobile and they are accepting as high as RM1,900 for an iPhone 6 Plus. On top of that, all trade-ups to an iPhone 6s will enjoy extra savings with an additional RM100 rebate.   In terms of device, the subsidised iPhone 6s pricing on U Mobile are as follows (inclusive 6% GST): During sign up, there’s an advance payment which is rebated back across 24 months. However this can be waived if you pay the device by credit card and sign up for auto debit billing facility. There’s also a  0% interest EPP scheme  with participating credit cards.  Another neat reason to sign up with U Mobile is its Contract Freedom promise. You may leave their network at anytime without penalty. However you’ll either lose the remaining rebates if you’ve paid advance payment and for those who didn’t, will need to pay back the pro-rated subsidy of the device.   Previously U Mobile had introduced its very own MicroCredit facility which is basically a special financing for the device. This time they are offering the extra flexibility of the amount (RM1,000-RM3,500) as well as repayment duration (12, 24, 30 and 36 months) according to your preference. With MicroCredit, there’s no deposit or credit card required but take note that they will charge you with an interest rate of 1.2%.  Interested?

Thinking of convenience and comfort of its users, the green coloured telco company has designed a  pre-order site , that’ll allow you to have the device sent to you or self-collected at any 40 Maxis Centres around Malaysia. If you missed the pre-order window, fear not as Maxis has a better thought out plan this year around, with its RealView system in place. Weathering a storm of demanding customers who want their devices as quick as possible; given the pretty penny they’ll fork out for it, Maxis wants to set the tone early, establishing that they’ve learnt from their mistakes and their distinctive system covers all bases, leaving no customer left behind. Their campaign begins with their  pre-order site , that’s already live for you to register your device to your name and get it within 24 hours on the 16 th  of October onwards. Maxis’ Express Delivery promises to hand-deliver your pristinely purchased iPhone 6s (Plus) to whatever location within Malaysia you wish to be sent to within 24 hours; provided you’re there to collect upon delivery. If you’re not too candid about having someone deliver your unit to you, you can choose the Express Collection at their 40 outlets in Malaysia. An option that makes a whole lot of sense for the people who want to unpack the smartphone there and then to check if everything is in working order, allowing you to raise concerns at the outlet upon noticing anything amiss.

If that’s not enough, 3 more unique models will be heading our way which includes the epic ASUS Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition, Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max.   This is the mother of all Zenfone 2s. The  Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition  is not only the fancier version of its top of the line Zenfone 2 with 4GB of RAM but it comes with a whopping 256GB of storage. In actual fact, the on-board storage is just 128GB but ASUS is throwing in additional 128GB extra with a bundled microSD card.  The rest of the specs remain unchanged with a Intel Atom Z3580 Quad-Core processor mated to 4GB of RAM and it gets the similar 13MP+5MP camera combos, 3,000mAh battery and dual-SIM slots that support 4G LTE. From the recent ASUS media briefing, we are told that the Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition would be available in November. The elusive Zenfone Zoom that was  announced earlier  this year isn’t scrapped just yet. Seen as the answer to other photography centric smart phones like the Galaxy K Zoom, the Zenfone Zoom offers a 3X Optical Zoom lens that surprisingly doesn’t protrude. During its initial announcement, the camera has a 13MP sensor mated to 10 element lens which is assisted by OIS and dual-tone LED flash.  In terms of hardware, it is said to feature a 5.5″ Full HD display, 128GB of on-board storage, 4G LTE support and a 3,000mAh capacity battery. Since it is almost a year, ASUS is likely to make some tweaks to keep it up to date with the current smart phones.   Last but not least is the ASUS Zenfone Max that’s entry level on specs but goes large on battery. It gets a 5.5″ HD 720p display and under the hood it gets a Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage. The biggest star of course is the massive 5,000mAh battery which should probably last more than 2 days on a single charge. Both the Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Max would be available sometime in December before the year is out."
Arif Lee,Half of iPhone 6s’ produced may have lower performance and there’s nothing you can do about it,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/09/half-of-iphone-6s-produced-may-have-lower-performance-and-theres-nothing-you-can-do-about-it/,"apple,iOS,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Battery Life,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Processor,iPhone 6s variants,iPhone 6s versions,Samsung,TSMC","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-09,"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s Plus with Geekbench results shown above A manufacturer with high standards such as Apple would be assumed to be a company that it takes a lot to please but do 2% – 3% of a gap make a difference? Well it surely does, if you look at the actual numbers. Immensely so, if you needed that extra battery mile to last through your long work day or on your expedition in some desolated area. Apple says the difference is negligible on the  iPhone 6s  and the  iPhone 6s Plus  but we’ll let you decide yourself. Basically, Apple’s iDevices vary in their processors by engaging two different vendors to supply their A9 chipset. On one hand, you have (their competitor) Samsung, while the other 50% is made by TSMC. The former has a 14nm FinFET process footprint, opposed to the latter – 16.nm FinFET process. This allegiance is nothing new, as Apple has enlisted help for quite a number of years already. In real-world scenarios the 2-3% could set off alarms, depending how you use your new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A Geekbench battery test was run comparing the two devices and the results are shown below: On the left is the Samsung processor. The right is the TSMC processor. Other than their battery scores, the two processors also performed differently on AnTuTu’s benchmark – TSMC’s chip won overall. In the same test, it was also clear that their batteries levels differed; again, the TSMC processor had more battery left (77%), when compared to the Samsung powered iPhone 6s (71%). If you managed to do the math, that’s a 6% disparity in numbers, which is double the 3% Apple noticed in their lab tests. Then again, once you’ve loaded up your apps and info, your device would run totally different compared to someone with the same chipset. So its possible that Apple was spot on with the 2-3% irregularity. Being quick to assess damage Apple has since made a statement addressed to the various publications that brought this information to light. There’s nothing much you can do about it though, but if you’d like to see if you’ve one-upped a friend/family member of yours, by all means use this iTunes approved  Lirum Device Info Lite – System Monitor  to identify if your iPhone 6s / Plus is using the better performing chip If your device list these magic model numbers below then you’re in luck: TSMC processor 
iPhone 6s – N71MAP / iPhone 6s Plus – N66MAP but if you’re finding this model number instead, you’re on the other end: Samsung processor 
iPhone 6s – N71AP / iPhone 6s Plus – N66AP There may be a silver lining after all, cause any company should have an amazing reason choosing two sources for their internals. As far as supply and demand go, it’s tough when you need to go to a competitor like Samsung to get your chipsets, and relying on them is definitely pain. You could say that, biting the bullet and producing real-world results through its products on the shelves allows Apple to gauge if there’s still worth in getting chips from Samsung. Can Malaysians nationwide do anything about this? Well it’ll be hard to make a case stating that their device is inferior, cause there’s no way of telling the difference when actually buying the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus; unlike Android OEMs (e.g Samsung) that clearly tell you that this model is an Exynos processor, while the other is a Qualcomm chip. Apple’s statement was only directed at one publication but it doesn’t take a lot to assume that they will continue to roll-out system updates that could make them more alike; whether that means making the Samsung chip in the iPhone 6s / Plus better than the TSMC’s or vice versa, still remains unseen. Their power in controlling both their hardware and software internally gives them the ability to tweak and adjust to these issues highlighted. What do you make of this? Will Apple’s new iPhones suffer? Or will people just live with their new status symbol? Let us know your thoughts in the comment below. [  SOURCE ,  1 ,  2  ]"

For Celcom, they are also accepting pre-orders today but only at their on ground Bluecube and Celcom outlets. Earlier on we’ve seen the official iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus  Recommended Retail Prices  from both telcos which seems to differ by RM100. For those who plan to buy outright, your other alternative is to get one from the Malaysian Online Apple Store and they have just published its full pricing for the two latest models. In short, don’t expect them to be any different from what we’ve seen from Digi. As seen earlier, the full pricing is similar to Digi with the iPhone 6s priced from RM3,199 for the 16GB model while the iPhone 6s Plus going from RM3,699 for the same capacity. Below is the full pricelist for the entire range available right now: While it is listed on the  Apple Store , it isn’t available for orders just yet. Our guess is to try checking them out next week closer to launch but you would probably need a wait a bit longer for delivery. So RM3,199 for a 16GB iPhone 6s, is this the flagship worth paying for? For long term practicality especially if you take photos and videos a lot, which we think you would, we strongly recommend that you go for at least 64GB.   Alternatively you could consider taking one up subsidised on contract with a plan that suits your needs. Both  Digi  and  Maxis  have revealed their plans and you can pre-order with them now. The iPhone 6s will be available officially in Malaysia next Friday, 16th October.  [  SOURCE  ]"

A year and a half later the CEO of Sony, Kazuo Hirai spoke to reporters saying that there has been constant restructuring in the smartphone department but if they fail to bring home the milk or at least self-sustain next year, they might have to scrap it all together. Change doesn’t immediately equate to results but it points in the right direction, if you’ve been paying attention to the recently released  Xperia Z5  line, it’s a glimmer of hope that could turnaround Sony’s profits. A lesson from its  Xperia Z3+  that received a lot of negativity, due to the bad choice of processor – the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 (at the time the heat issues weren’t mediated properly).  Here’s  a look at how the Z5 Premium handles its heating. Sony’s lineup has looked awfully familiar for quite a number of generations; begging the question, if they’ll do away with their OmniBalance design. Rumours say that they might just do so in 2016 – chances are it’ll coincide with the new  Concept  for Android that Sony has been testing in Sweden.   Even with the aforementioned measures taken to decrease losses could not save Sony from expectedly posting a 60 billion yen / US$ 480 million (RM 1.97 billion) lost for this year. Exceeding the indicative figure of 39 billion yen / US$ 310 million (RM 1.27 billion) that was predicted. Not a great outlook for the Japanese company that ships only 1% of the smartphones in the States, while just captivating 17.5% of its own domestic market. Here’s the statement from Hirai on the state of Xperia’s business Can Sony make a U-turn? We’d like to see that happen, as the Xperias are a great offering and less competition is always a bad thing for consumers. Keep on keeping on, Sony, we hope for the best. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2 ]"

Is this the OnePlus X?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/09/oneplus-x-e1003-malaysia-certification/,"Android,Dual Sim,OnePlus,OnePlus E1003,OnePlus E1003 malaysia,OnePlus mini,OnePlus mini Malaysia,OnePlus X,OnePlus X Malaysia,SIRIM","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-10-09,"Taking some heat away from OnePlus’ inability to supply enough of their  OnePlus 2 , a new device has been spotted on the SIRIM database as E1003. This comes 2 months after Carl Pei was quoted on  USA Today  that he had a hard time choosing between the (possible)  OnePlus X/mini  and the OnePlus 2. OnePlus’ newest smartphone is apparently its take on a more aesthetically pleasing product, not its usual “Flagship Killer” motive. What we can confirm so far is that the new One E1003 will only support Wi-Fi bands from a/g/n omitting the best “ac” support out. At least it’ll support Dual-SIM LTE based on the certification listing, bringing some hope for the device. A previous report states that the OnePlus X/mini would launch sometime during the holiday season, echoing the  sentiments  of its co-founder and will retail for only  US$ 250  (RM 1,035). While its price might draw conclusions that it’ll less than worthy spec device, it surprises by supposedly running a MediaTek Helio X10 processor, coupled with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM. Its screen is reported to be a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display and the storage appears to be 32GB internally, and it’ll have a microSD slot – a first for the OnePlus lineup. Tuned up with a polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass the edges will taper smoothly, hoping translating to better ergonomics. Somewhere under the hood, its purported that there will be at least 3,000/3,100 mAh powering the new smartphone. Straying a bit from the OnePlus 2, the Mini is claimed anonymously to carry NFC, an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and the familiar USB Type-C that supports fast charge. Camera-wise it allegedly showcases a 13-megapixel f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor, supporting video up until 4K if you’re into the whole pixel game. The front on the other hand, gets a 5-megapixel shutter. There also has been rumours that it’ll be IP67 dust and waterproof, yet it’ll still maintain the removable back with customisable finishes and textures. Do you think  Maxis  has delivered enough OnePlus 2’s to be able to handle the ramped-up demand of this mid-ranger? We’d just caution everyone that the information above barring the SIRIM details are rumours, so don’t jump the gun yet. By the way, our friends at  the Skop  are giving away a new OnePlus 2 with an Otterbox case, if you’d like to find out more head on over  here . Thanks to Felix for pointing this out."

When asked about the company’s prospects by the Verge during the recent Code Mobile conference, their CEO said that failing to reach 5 million units sold, the company might abandon the mobile business. We’ve seen the falling of giants before, with Nokia first coming to mind but the physical QWERTY keyboard loving manufacturer has felt change was needed. Thus, the  BlackBerry PRIV  was envisioned, it’s first Android device. BB10 software was left out to see if this change would revitalise the brand but the PRIV did still include some signature security tech, as the devices namesake is also drawn from the word “privacy”. Posting their recent financial quarter results, the manufacturer only managed to sell 800,000 phones, an underwhelming number by a long shot. PRIV’s security that’s quoted to match Samsung’s Knox will still have some advantages according to Chen; battery technology, antenna technology and a physical slide out keyboard, along with other enticing  specs . The CEO also refused to say that BB10 will cease to exist if the PRIV takes flight and sells well. Their secure OS is often seen in high-risk business settings, similar to those in the public sector. Getting these same individuals to purchase the latest BlackBerry offering and move over to the new setting will be tough; migration aside, it isn’t common to waltz into a telco or carrier’s store and be able to purchase a BlackBerry device in the US. As the new smartphone runs Android, carriers are more open to picking it up for their stores. As such the CEO has been busy reaching out to them to sell the Android slider. He adds that carriers have responded positively, citing that staff familiarity with the OS would help when it comes to customer interactions. If BlackBerry’s run finally came to an end, would it make a difference in your life? Let us know in the comments below. [  SOURCE  ]"

 UPDATE 2 : Apple Malaysia reveals its  iPhone 6s pricing  on the Online Store Scalpers can be gone, unless they want to price their stocks at a more competitive price; as the official prices of the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are revealed by  Digi . It’ll cost you from RM 3,199 for the iPhone 6s, while the iPhone 6s Plus starts from RM 3,699. Pre-orders start on the 9th can be made through the  Celcom ,  Digi ,  Maxis  and  U Mobile  but these devices will only be in your hands from October 16th onwards. Hotly anticipated by Malaysians, as the Apple craze will sweep the nation yet again this year, though the long queues have dissipated since the iPhone 4s. Other than the previously stated telcos you’ll be able to get the smartphones from authorised retail outlets. Tougher and thicker, thanks to the 7000D series aluminium that added 0.1-0.2mm to its overall footprint. It also adds on 14grams of extra heft at 143 grams for the iPhone 6s and 20grams on the iPhone 6s Plus at 192g. Stacking the phones side by side, you’ll see a 4.7-inch (iPhone 6s) and 5.5-inch (iPhone 6s Plus) Retina Display – the same on the older 6 and 6 Plus smartphones. Under the hood, there’s a 64-bit enabled A9 chip that has a 70% increase in performance over the A8 processor. Performance is multiplied by integrating the M9 motion co-processor onto the A9 chip, saving some space internally as well at the same time. Taking a look at its battery, in actual fact the capacity decreases but in real-life situation it still maintains the same battery life with stronger power efficiency in iOS. For its colour options, Apple now adds a Rose Gold variant that is probably aimed to draw in the more feminine high-class crowd. Storage of these two devices remain the same at 16GB, 64GB and 128GB, a hard-case to justify why Apple doesn’t raise their bare minimum to 32GB but people will likely accept it. The prices below are  thanks to Digi , whose’ pre-order page went live before 12 midnight. So here’s the breakdown of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, with a price comparison made to the older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus during its initial launch: A turn of events have lead to Maxis providing  another set  of RRP pricing, differing from the RRP by Digi already listed above. Here’s Maxis’ RRP pricing: Force Touch is a new feature on the latest iPhones that we’ve seen in action on the MacBook trackpads and Apple Watches. Already multi-touch packed, the screen now adds pressure sensitivity technology dubbed as 3D Touch. Gentle taps, long presses and hard presses bring up new options – allowing users to do more with the same device. Doubling the iSIght camera on their new duo, both of them get bumped up to 12-megapixels with f/2.2 aperture, at the same time it also gets dual-tone LED flash for a more natural looking flash. The big brother in the form of the 6s Plus does have an upper hand in the camera department, as Apple has added Optical Image Stabilisation. On the front however, the old 1.2-megapixel sensor is replaced by a 5-megapixel shutter with f/2.2 aperture and adding the new Retina Flash to brighten up your selfies. Apple has prepared their new iPhones’ by adding more pixels to their sensors but how well will the devices stack up against the other camera smartphones in our latest  camera comparison  between the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s Plus, LG G4 and Samsung Note5.

Arif Lee,Shocking the world with the most powerful 13-inch laptop; the Microsoft Surface Book,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/08/microsoft-surface-book-the-best-13-inch-laptop/,"13-inch laptop,13-inch tablet,2-in-1 convertible laptop,Announcement,Book,keynote,launch,microsoft,Microsoft 13-inch laptop,Microsoft Surface Book,official,powerful laptop,powerful PC,Surface,Surface Book,Tablet,Windows 10,Windows 10 devices","Cool stuff,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices",2015-10-08,"We thought Microsoft was done after the HoloLens,  Band 2  and  Surface Pro 4  but nope, they kept the best (well-kept secret) for last; their first laptop, the Surface Book. If you’ve ever wanted a Surface but preferred it to be bigger and a non-flex like typing experience, Microsoft has just machined it for you. At 13.5-inches, the Gorilla Glass PixelSense screen will still give you a touchscreen experience at 3000 x 2000 resolution delivering 267 ppi. The display gives you the ability to tote it around if you just want a “clipboard” or attach it to the keyboard for (Microsoft’s promised) the best typing experience on a laptop. Microsoft bundles the Surface Pen together giving you the tool to create content, be it drawing or writing. The Pen, which has 1,024 levels of touch sensitivity – that’s 4 times more compared to the old Pen, and they added an eraser too on the tail. Yet another way to interact with the screen in one of the most precise methods in a tool that supposedly gives you all-year battery life.. If the Pen doesn’t suit your needs, the keyboard and trackpad should – giving you 1.6mm of key travel and a huge precision touch glass pad for those cursor movements. Intel’s latest 6 th  Gen Intel (Skylake) processor sits inside this wonderful package. If you need more graphics? Just add on the dedicated graphics card (at a pretty price), which is somewhere under the keyboard. RAM options start from 8GB and go up to 16GB and you’ll have PCIE storage that range from 128GB to 512GB – odd, if you noticed that the Surface Pro 4 went up to 1TB. Being a Windows 10 devices event, its a given that the it runs Windows 10 out of the box. Productivity and exceptional performance, Microsoft’s new toy is expected to handle your designing, video editing and gaming; all in one seamless (not gap-less, eh) package. So much power in a small footprint but how does the battery fare? Microsoft swears by a 12-hour battery life but we’ll wait for the real-world testing first before jumping on the bandwagon. But wait, a laptop? Who could care less, then the video showed that you can detach it from the keyboard. Sharing information now is easier, just detach and pass it down; literally, they passed it around during the presentation. Run programs like Adobe Creative Cloud, AutoCAD, Citrix and anything else on the Book + Keyboard combo, since the discrete card lives in the latter. Their dynamic fulcrum hinge and cable wire lock technology looks promising but we noticed some unnecessary screen wobbling towards the end after angling the screen, hopefully it holds up well over time. Fashioned out of magnesium in a 3.48 pounds (approx. 1.5 kg) package, the dimensions of the device are below: The ports of this detach-able laptop are two USB 3.0 ports, a full-sized SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a mini DisplayPort. On connectivity you’ll get 802.11ac for Wi-Fi while also supporting a/b/g/n. Being a tablet of-sorts, it has an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, capable of 1080p recording while for audio it has a dual microphone setup (front and rear) and Dolby front-facing stereo speakers. Here are the configuration options that you’ll be able to personalise your Surface Book and how well it stacks up against the Surface Pro 4: There’s no word when the Surface Book will arrive in Malaysia as of yet. A sadder notion is that the exchange rate isn’t favouring the Ringgit at all currently, though we’d like to know if you’d consider Microsoft’s new Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book.

Likely to retain the same design as the current R7 series, the new model is to be called the OPPO R7s.  While they haven’t officially released the specs for the device, the brand claims that the device will have a bigger battery, screen and double the storage of the R7 plus a stronger frame and camera. As far as rumoured specs go, the device is expected to have a Snapdragon 615 SoC with a 1.5GHz CPU under the hood mated to 3GB RAM and 32GB expandable storage via microSD slot. It will also have a 5.5 inch Full HD AMOLED display as well as a 13 megapixel rear and 8 megapixel camera combo. It is expected to run  Android  5.1.1 Lollipop. No word on the battery capacity however. If the rumours are true, then the device would be a slight step up from the original R7, be it only in screen size and internal storage. Aside from the R7s, OPPO will also be showing off many of their other devices such as the  R7 Plus ,  R7 Lite ,  Mirror 5  as well as the  R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition.  Speaking of which, to commemorate the new partnership, OPPO’s booth will also include a football pitch, just to drive the partnership home. The launch is a little under two weeks away but we will be sure to update more on launch day itself."

Now there’s a better solution on the way as Google has just announced Google Drive backup integration with WhatsApp.  This allows you to save those important WhatsApp chats, audio messages, photos and even videos to the cloud, so you’ll never lose them if anything happens to your device.  Once enabled, you can set to backup automatically by daily, weekly or monthly. You also get to choose not to include those bulky videos to your backup. The cloud backup feature has been long anticipated for Android users, and it was  actually released  for a short while in April before WhatsApp pulled the plug. For iOS, iPhone users are already able to backup their chats automatically and they are stored on Apple’s iCloud service. At time of writing, the latest version on the Google Play Store still doesn’t have the Google Drive option yet. According to Google, the feature will be rolling out in the coming months, so it looks like we’ve got to wait for a while before it reaches here.  [  SOURCE  ]"
Arif Lee,Microsoft wants you to Live Healthier and Achieve More with its new Band 2,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/08/microsoft-wants-you-to-live-healthier-and-achieve-more-with-its-new-microsoft-band-2/,"2,Band,Band 2,barometer,heart,microsoft,Microsoft Band 2,Microsoft smartwatch,Microsoft wearable,SmartWatch,wearable","Android,iOS,Microsoft,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2015-10-08,"The tech giant built by Bill Gates just released a wide line-up of devices during its keynote two days ago. They drew oooohs and ahhhhs during their presentation that starred the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book, the HoloLens and the smallest of the bunch, the Microsoft Band 2. Microsoft wants you to destroy limits with their new wearable, stated for individuals who want to be in a better state of health and just get more things done. Microsoft’s first band was packed with features but failed to be something people would want on their wrist, partly cause of its design; often compared to be clunky and simply too cumbersome to be a daily wearable. Consumers should now be happier, cause Microsoft listened and their engineers in Redmond took more time to design the Band 2 to be more ergonomic. A word that you’d first expect to hear when wearables are concerned. Now curvier than ever, its Gorilla glass display tears at an angle! Yes, we all love curves. Some (beneficial) elements do return; in the form of the AMOLED display (320 x 128), 2 day battery life, GPS and an optical heart sensor. The device can thank the battery’s change of placement for being less bulky, now at one end of the smart watches’ straps. On the opposite end of the strap is a metal clasps – nothing too interesting, except it doubles as the charging connector that you snap on to the charging dock magnetically. The 0-80% in 30 minutes fast charging feature makes a return too, making sure you’ll be ready to get to it after charging in just half an hour. Design language aside, the Microsoft Band 2 has some internal upgrades that increase its adaptability for those who love staying active. A barometer now lives somewhere on the watch, along with a native UV sensor that monitors rays constantly. Golfers will surely ravel at the sensors and functionality included; distances measured from the tee to the hole and swing mechanics to help those drives just to name a few. It’ll help you track other stuff too with its 8 other sensors. Tracking sports like running, biking and weights should appeal to the common folk too. Day to day task are easier to handle with your new personal assistant, Cortana, who lives on your device as well. Supported mobile devices are listed below: You’ll be able to get your hands on the Microsoft Band 2 in the States for $249.99 (RM 1,049), $50 more than its predecessor but a worthy price to pay for a hefty upgrade.

Alexander Wong,Surface Pro 4: The Tablet that could put Most Laptops to shame,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/07/surface-pro-4-the-tablet-that-could-put-most-laptops-to-shame/,"Laptop,microsoft,Microsoft Surface,Microsoft Surface Pro,Microsoft Surface Pro 4,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Malaysia,Microsoft Windows 10,New Surface pen,Surface,Surface Pro 4 Type Cover,Tablet,Windows 10","Microsoft,Mobile Devices",2015-10-07,"The tablet is normally seen as a media consumption device and nobody has done productivity better than Microsoft’s Surface Pro series. The new Surface Pro 4 marks its 4th generation of its 2-in-1 tablet/laptop convergence device and it runs on the very latest Windows 10.  The current Surface Pro 3 to us is a breakthrough as it offers a full Windows experience in a true tablet form. It did live up to its “Tablet that could replace your Laptop” claim and the new one just raises the bar to a whole new level.  Size does matter and we’ve seen countless of 2-in-1 devices that are just too heavy for tablet use. The Surface Pro 4 now gets a larger 12.3″ display that does a higher 2736×1824 pixels resolution while maintaining the same footprint of 292.1mm x 201.42mm. As comparison, the Surface Pro 3 has a 12″ screen that pushes 2160×1440 pixels resolution. On top of that, Microsoft has made it even thinner at 8.45mm (Surface Pro 3: 9.1mm) and lighter from 766 grams (Surface Pro 3: 800g).  The front still gets a pair of stereo speakers and microphones while the top gets a 5MP front camera. Over at the rear, the camera gets bumped up to 8MP and it comes with auto focus. You still get a full sized USB 3.0, microSD card reader, headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort, all encased in its Magnesium body that comes in Silver.  In the current Surface Pro 3, Microsoft had introduced a variety of Intel Core processors with various memory and storage options to suit every need. For the Surface Pro 4, the list is even more extensive with the latest 6th generation Intel Core processors. At the base level, they have opt for an Intel Core m3 processor instead of the usual i3 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. For those who demand more power and have a loads of cash to burn, you can opt for the highest Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.  Performance wise, the Surface Pro 4 is reported to be 30% faster than the Surface Pro 3 and 50% faster than the competing MacBook Air. No doubt it drives the price up to exorbitant levels and this is made worse with our current exchange rate. The full pricing for the Surface Pro 4 are as follows: Moving on to what makes the Surface Pro 4 a laptop replacement is the keyboard. The new Surface Pro 4 Type Cover has been massively improved to provide a better laptop class experience and it is thinner than before. The keys have been redesigned with larger spacing in between like a laptop chiclet keyboard which is made quieter and comfortable to type on. The trackpad meanwhile is 40% larger and it comes with a glass surface that tracks 5 multi-touch points. If you’re using a Surface Pro 3, good news for you as the new keyboard is compatible as well. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is priced at US$129.99 which is about RM554. With more players getting their hands onto styluses, Microsoft had introduced a newer Surface Pen. It boasts 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity (current Surface Pen: 256 levels) and it even comes with an eraser at the back. This replaces the secondary button on the sides, leaving just one for right clicking, while the eraser tip still doubles as a Magic Button which launches OneNote on a single click.  For the right feel and shade, there are interchangeable Pen Tips where you can swap from 2H, H, HB and B tips. It still connects via Bluetooth and with a AAAA battery, the new Surface Pen still lasts a whole year without charging needed in between. For storage, the Surface Pen now clips onto the slides of the Surface Pro 4 with the help of magnets. It sounds like a good solution but we’re not sure if it could hold on well with clumsy hands.   Overall, the Surface Pro 4 is thinner, lighter, faster and massively improved to steer you away from the traditional laptop. For those who work on the lap a lot, we are still unconvinced with the practicality of the kick stand but it is perfect when it’s used on the table. With the price tag of US$999 for the minimum Core i5 model, it is quite expensive compared to other similarly equipped laptops. If budget permits, this is still the best 2in1 hybrid tablet/laptop out there and it is more practical than Apple’s  iPad Pro . It will be available at selected markets on 26th October with pre-orders available starting today. For more info, head over to the  Surface Pro 4  page."

A leap forward for all laptops/tablets for sure, the ultra-productivity machine is back again and it’ll hit Malaysia just in the time for the year-end shopping season. You can expect to see the  Surface Pro 4  on Malaysians shelves by the 19 th  of November, leaving a lot of time to test it out before deciding to purchase it as a gift, possibly during the December gift-giving season – that’s if you have 4 figures to spare on the device that is priced from US$ 899 (RM 3,790). The aforementioned price is just an indication of how much you’ll be dishing out for the 2-in-1 convertible. Below we’ve listed the prices of the OLD Surface Pro 3 (at the time the USD to MYR exchange rate was 3.147) Compare that to their US prices today: We hope that the Ringgit trades higher in the coming month so your devices will be cheaper. Obviously there will still be people buying these devices at their current prices, but one can only hope for the best. Multitasking, productivity and portability are just some of the Surface Pro 4’s main advantages, and powerful enough to be the “Tablet that can replace your laptop”, many have already put their bets on the recently released device. From the well-phrased tweet above, you’ll see that Microsoft’s twitter account officially mentions the release date proving that Malaysia isn’t always the last in receiving devices, with only a 6-week wait beckoning. The same account @marauderz  asked  about the  Surface Book  too but received a lesser informative reply, stating that the bigger device will begin its release in US, Canada and Australia; in that order, followed by a roll-out in other countries (no indicative date set). At least Microsoft Malaysia has put up a  page  for the Surface Pro 4 on its website, keeping us a little happier. We’ll be sure to update everyone if any other news surfaces about the…….. Surface(s). [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Arif Lee,Has Apple made a comeback with its iPhone 6s Plus’ camera? You tell us,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/08/iphone-6s-plus-camera-vs-galaxy-note-5-lg-g4-iphone-6-malaysia-shootout/,,,2015-10-08,"UPDATE : We’ve tabulated the votes for the shootout. Jump straight to  Page 4  to find out which is the best as voted by you New devices,  call for new camera shootout tests and our latest camera blind test will pit the newest  iPhone 6s Plus  against the  iPhone 6 ,  Samsung Galaxy Note5  and  LG G4 . The last smartphone that took home the  best camera  as voted by you guys was the LG G4, but will it come to an end today? The newcomer of the group, the iPhone 6s Plus doesn’t pack a high megapixel count – only 12 on its rear iSight camera but its pixels come in at 1.22µ pixels, helping it somewhat. Storage might be an issue for the aforementioned device if you love those Live Photos, since the extra “moving picture” takes up roughly the same amount of space as the photos you take. Distinctive to the “Plus” is OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation), allowing you to take more stable shots when compared to its little brother, while its aperture is listed at f/2.2. For the first time we decided to include the front camera for our shootout and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus has a 5-megapixel sensor up front, with the same aperture as its rear camera. It also has the new Retina Flash, Apple’s alternative to putting an LED flash at the front like some selfie-centric phones in the market. Edging out the competition in the last shootout, does the 16-megapixel (rear) LG G4 camera have what it takes to hit the podium again? Well, the f/1.8 aperture rear camera has some tricks up its sleeves – similarly it has OIS as well but laser autofocus is what sets it apart. In terms of the front sensor, 8-megapixels makes its way on the top half of the display. A close second was the Galaxy Note5, that boasts the same megapixel count as the LG G4 and it also has OIS to back up its camera’s capabilities. On the front however, it isn’t so pixel hungry, as the selfie camera is only 5-megapixels."

Most recently, Stagefright is to blame for all the manufacturers being caught with their pants down – if you don’t know what Stagefright is, check it out  here . To cut it short, it’s a malicious exploit that digs up personal information on your Android device. And as smartphone vendors scrambled to get their acts together through rolling out OTA updates,  HTC ‘s President has gone on record to say that monthly updates are “unrealistic”. Following the whole shamble, both Samsung and Google jumped on to have monthly updates to remedy any such incidents in the future. Further extending on Android 6.0 when Google highlights the ability for the OS to show you when you last downloaded and applied a security update.   Some HTC users took to Twitter to address their anxiety as to why the Taiwanese company had been so silent on the matter; compared to LG and Samsung who made statements immediately. Jason Mackenzie, President of HTC Americas then replied these tweets saying that cellular carriers are setting an “unrealistic” schedule; he then adds that HTC doesn’t want to commit to something and receive backlash for not delivering that same promise. As a follow-up, Mackenzie does say that HTC has been very transparent with their updates, which will only get better – as seen by  Android Headlines , who says that the company updates them frequently on submission of updates to carriers (even pre-approval). Also, they’ve been notified about what these pre-approved updates include. Have the three vendor who’ve promised monthly updates stuck to them? Will they be capable in doing so? No doubt, the thought is a welcomed one, but after learning a thing or to about how updates get passed through carriers (at least in the States), maybe what Mackenzie is saying is somewhat true.

To bring the same experience onto smaller screens, they had just announced their latest flagship smart phones – the  Lumia 950  and  Lumia 950 XL . The operating system is no longer called Windows Phone but simply Windows 10 in line with its new direction.  The Lumia 950 and 950 XL aren’t just about the latest hardware but a more integrated experience with its family of products. One notable feature is how it transforms the smart phone to deliver a PC-like experience via Windows Continuum. This is better implemented than other smart phone to PC docks we’ve seen before. Going through the specs, there’s no surprises from what we’ve seen in  earlier leaks . Both the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL come with a Quad HD AMOLED ClearBlack display that are 5.2″ and 5.7″ respectively. These are the highest resolution smart phones Microsoft has ever made with over 500ppi in pixel density. The Lumia 950 XL gets Gorilla Glass 4 protection while the Lumia 950 settles for Gorilla Glass 3.  Under the hood, the 950 XL gets Qualcomm’s 2.0GHz Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor while the 950 gets a 1.8GHz Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 unit. Both of which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. Should you need more especially when shooting 4K videos, there’s a microSD slot which supports 200GB. But in theory, it can go up to 2TB when such capacity is available. Being a flagship, the PureView camera is back with a 20MP f/1.9 1/2.4″ main shooter with a triple-LED RGB flash for natural looking illumination. Like most new high-end devices, it shoots 4K videos in 30fps while audio is is captured with Lumia Rich Recording that uses 4 microphones. For shake free shots, Optical Image Stabilisation comes as standard and you can capture moments quicker with a dedicated camera button. For the front, it gets a 5MP wide angle f/2.4 camera which supports Full HD video recording. Keeping the lights on is a removable 3,000mAh battery for the Lumia 950 and a larger 3,340mAh for the XL sibling. As one of the pioneers of wireless charging on a smart phone, it still supports native Qi Wireless charging for both models. If you decide to juice up the old school way, Microsoft is future-proofing its Lumia 950/950 XL with USB Type C that supports fast charging. During the presentation, they shared that a 50% charge can be accomplished in just 30 minutes. Connectivity wise, both ticked the right boxes with faster 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and 4G LTE. Which ever model you pick, there’s also a dual-SIM variant but it is subject to each respective market. Another new feature is its Windows Hello biometric authentication feature. The actual workings behind it wasn’t explained clearly but the product demo looks similar to Android’s Face Unlock with the use of its front camera. Earlier rumours suggest an Iris recognition technology that’s assisted by IR light. Probably one of the coolest feature is Windows Continuum. With a  Microsoft Display Dock , you can simply plug in your USB Type C cable from your phone and it offers a PC-like desktop experience. The dock is a tiny box weighing 230 grams and it comes with 3 USB and HDMI/Display Port. When plugged in, you can check Outlook, edit your MS Office documents like a real machine and the transition is simply seamless. So if you got a spare monitor, keyboard and mouse at home, you can leave your clunky laptop at work but still get things done all from your mobile device. Now that’s the power of a PC in your pocket. The Lumia 950 and 950 XL will be available starting in November and they are priced at $549 (RM2,379) and $649 (RM2,813) respectively. So far there’s no word on Asia Pacific release but it is possible that they could be here before the year ends. For more info, head over to the  Lumia 950  and  Lumia 950 XL  product pages."

In terms of design, both models come with a standard clean look with the use of on-screen buttons. Over at the top, we get a closer look at the IR lamp which is used for its Iris scanner for Windows Hello. This lets you unlock your phone with a quick stare without having to use passwords. At the front, it gets a 5MP selfie camera with wide angle lens. Towards the back, it gets a polycarbonate body like its predecessor and much emphasis has been given to its PureView camera in terms of design.

Started up in 2006 by Hakuna Matata (communications agency) and the Fun Group (amusement park crane company) came together to set up this high-flying dining experience for 22 individuals and since has travelled across 45 countries in almost every occasion imaginable. Dinner in the Sky visited Malaysia during the month of August; the first country in South East Asia. Seizing this opportunity, MaxisOne Club member Ng Say Khai contacted Maxis to set up his proposal to his girlfriend of 8 years, Qiu Rong. Elaborate to say the least, the Maxis team decided to use 6 GoPros set up in a 360 view to record the wonderful occasion. Blind-folding the bride to be and accompanying her to the site, Khai took off her blindfold and once up in the air, she was surprised again with an engagement ring on her plate.

The Galaxy Active Neo could be considered sitting between the Galaxy Xcover 3 and the current high-end Galaxy S6 Active. Launched in Japan, the device carries a 4.5-inch display with a paltry 800 x 480 resolution, suiting its affordable price-tag. At least it runs Android Lollipop out of the box and is ready to resist dust and water, rated at IP67-certified, albeit having an exposed micro-USB port . It can also handle being dropped from 1.5 metres without damaging, helped by the Gorilla Glass 4 toughening the glass. At the helm of its brains will be a Snapdragon 410 processor and 2GB of RAM, providing just enough for daily tasks (little to no multitasking included). Camera-wise you’ll have an 8-megapixel rear and 2-megapixel front sensor, while its storage gets 16GB of expandable storage. Powering this LTE enabled device is a 2200 mAh battery and there are two colours to choose from – Camo White or Solid Black. Customers will also be entitled to a complimentary 100GB of Microsoft OneDrive storage for 2 years. Available in Japan from early November through the NTT DoCoMo carrier, for approximately $168 (RM 739). If you’re looking to buy this smartphone, there’s no news if the Active Neo will be released globally yet. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Knowing that this is a roll-out, you can expect the OTA’s to eventually come in but be ready to wait up to a month or so, until the actual notification update comes in. Expect new apps and features to now live on your device – notably, an extensive search function; Now on Tap, battery saving elements, and a revamped app permissions system. Now on Tap is pretty much now your best friend, on your smartphone. It’ll help you search up pretty much anything you need, keeping your task, scheduling and info always in check. A video below details what you can do with Now on Tap. Skip to 53:30 for the Google Now on Tap presentation.   Technology in the battery department has stalled since the installation of the lithium-ion polymer, causing heartache for those who rely on their devices for most of their life. Google however, wants to help out in terms of improving how your devices utilises the power it has. Doze on Android is just one of them, which puts your Android device into a deep sleep when idle for an extended period to minimize power usage. Tested in “controlled environments” Android techs pit one set of Marshmallow Nexuses’ against another bunch with the older Lollipop – and surprise, surprise, the former ran *roughly* 30% longer (based on standby time). Users will also get another function dubbed App Standby. A feature that puts your lesser opened apps into a state of reduced activity, making your device conserve more power for the apps that you use more often. Privacy options get a much appreciated update, now allowing you to personalise and select which permissions you want to give apps. Users are now able to pick what they want their apps to have access to at the time of use. All apps running on Marshmallow now only request permission when it needs to access one of the device’s functionalities (e.g. microphone, contacts, camera). Rejoice cause now you can deny permissions and still use the app but at a reduced functionality, of course. Permissions can now even be turned on and off for any app, in the new settings. With Android M the arrival of native finger-print support came together. A new (naturally) supported way to interact with your device, giving you power to protect your device in a multiple array of methods. The new OS places your fingerprint at the forefront of safeguarding your information, unlocking your device, authorising payments on the Google Play Store (& more), signing into other apps and paying through Android Pay (if available in your country). Much to be excited about for those who own a piece of Nexus tech and a lot more incentive for consumers to pick up the newest Nexus smartphones; the 5X and 6P. We sure hope that Google Malaysia brings products (officially) to our domestic market soon, cause we’re loving what we’re hearing about Marshmallow so far. Are you? [  SOURCE  ]"

Dubbed as the OnePlus mini, it is said that it would be  aesthetically focused instead of having top notch specs like the  OnePlus 2 . According to a new source, the OnePlus mini will be launched sometime in November/December with an estimated price tag of US$250, which is about RM1,091 in our current exchange rate. As expected with a “mini” model, it is a notch down with a purported 5″ Full HD IPS display and is powered by MediaTek’s Helio X10 processor mated with 2GB of LP-DDR3 RAM.  On-board storage seems to be decent at 32GB and guess what, it even comes with a microSD slot. For the front, it gets a more polished 2.5D Gorilla Glass which makes it smoother to touch around the edges. Keeping the lights on is a decent 3,000/3,100mAh capacity battery which is non removable.  The rest of the features appear to be an improvement over its “2016 Flagship Killer”. The anonymous source claims that NFC will be present along with an IR Blaster, front facing 1.2W loud speaker and a USB Type-C connector which supports fast charge.  The camera is said to be a 13MP f/2.0 IMX258 Sony Sensor that supports 4K videos while the front gets a standard 5MP shooter with Full HD video capabilities. Like the current OnePlus devices, the back is removable allowing you to customise with a variety of shells and word has it, that it could feature IP67 dust and waterproof capabilities. At this point, these are just speculations and while the specs are no way top notch like the OnePlus 2, the feature list seems to be quite compelling. However for the price tag, it faces cheaper alternatives like the Redmi Note 2 that’s priced at 999 CNY (about RM684). Even if you want it, buying it would be difficult as it would go through its rather limited invitation system.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The Moto X Play with the model number XT1562 has just passed our local SIRIM certification under distributor Brightstar.  For 2015, Motorola  had announced  2 versions of the Moto X. The Moto X Style is the top of the range version with a 5.7″ Quad HD display and a higher-end Snapdragon 808 processor. Meanwhile the incoming model is the Moto X Play with a 5.5″ Full HD screen and a mid-range Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM.

At the back it gets a 21MP main camera with dual-tone LED flash while selfies are taken with its 5MP front camera.  While the specs appear to be a notch below the Moto X Style, the Moto X Play should deliver a longer battery life per change. This is thanks to its huge 3,630mAh capacity battery that’s rated for 30 hours of use. On top of that, it also splash proof thanks to a water repellent coating.  Connectivity wise, it supports 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 and 4G LTE. According to the certification on SIRIM, we are getting the Dual SIM variant in Malaysia.

Celcom has introduced its new FIRST Basic 85 Internet Plan which gives you 21GB of mobile data for only RM85/month. Although it sounds the same, this isn’t the same as the standard  FIRST Basic 85  that comes with an OPTIMISER feature. Instead, this is a data-centric plan that gives you loads of data while calls are only charged when you need it. For RM85/month, by default it comes with 7GB of mobile data and 7GB of Celcom WiFi (if you could find one) that’s usable anytime of the day. The remaining 14GB of data (plus 14GB of Celcom WiFi) is allocated only for off-peak hours between 2AM and 8AM daily.  According to the  FAQ , unused internet can be carried forward with a maximum of 7GB to the following month and this is only from your 24 hour data bucket. Once you’ve finished your internet allocation, speeds will be throttled to 64kbps and there’s a limit of 15GB per billing cycle. If you need more data at full speeds, you can top up from as little as RM3 for 100MB, or you can opt for more at RM15/GB and RM50 for 5GB. As for calls, it isn’t specified clearly but SMS and MMS are charged at 15 sen to all networks. Interestingly if you’ve finished your FIRST Basic 85 Internet allocation, all calls and SMS are charged at 10sen. Come to think of it, this is basically Celcom’s  PortaWiFi 2.0 Internet Plan  with voice and you can sign up without the unnecessary activation and registration fee.  Should you get this over the standard Celcom FIRST Basic 85? If you use more than 5GB a month and hardly make any calls, the answer is probably yes. As comparison, the standard FIRST Basic 85  currently  gives you 5GB of internet, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS for the heavy internet user. Alternative those who talk a lot will get 2GB of internet plus 600 minutes of calls and 600 SMS each month. If you’re interested, this plan is available from now until 31st October and take note that it comes with a 12 months contract.

Officially there was no mention on screen size but they said it was all about a larger viewing experience. Possibly occupying a place in our dwellings but not moving around as much as smaller tablets. Spotted on GFXBench benchmarks, we now have a rough idea of what this device is going to be. Codenamed under the model number SM-T670, the monstrous tablet is listed to have an 18.5-inch display at 1920×1080 (FHD); at this size, we’d likely appreciate a higher resolution but we’ll have to see it in real life before making any assumptions. Theoretically the tablet will be viewed further away, more like a TV, so the “bigger” pixels shouldn’t be too noticeable. For it’s processor, it’ll run a 64-bit Octa-core Exynos 7580 processor coupled with a Mali-T720 GPU. This new processor is expected to fit in the mid-range chip-set market, as it’s supposedly only clocked at 1.6GHz; as far as we can tell, bigger model number doesn’t mean that this processor will be anywhere near the Exynos 7440. Similarly, the new processor was seen on the mid-range Galaxy J7 and the device’s benchmarks saw that it beat the Snapdragon 615 – which isn’t saying much. Back to the huge tablet’s specs, the listing also states that it’ll have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Otherwise, it’ll carry an 8-megapixel rear camera (based on another report) and a measly 2-megapixel sensor on the front (probably just enough for video calls, if necessary). Samsung’s Galaxy View will apparently size at 451.8 x 275.8 x 11.9mm and feature a 5,700 mAh battery; raising some alarms, but it could mean that Samsung assumes you’ll have the device plugged in long-term. It has already been passed  SIG  and  RRA  certifications, a tell-tale sign that Samsung will probably launch this device soon. [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

Worrying for Sony, who had relative success in supplying cameras to other flagships (iPhones, Samsungs and etc); success that has not streamed down to their own phone cameras, at least when field tested. A new change comes in the form of the latest  Sony Xperia Z5 line , that’s been tested by the guys at  DxOMark , showing a vast improvement. The newer 23-megapixel 1 / 2.3-inch Exmor RS sensor with an f/2.0 lens, is the biggest determining factor here – when compared to the M5 that has a 21.5-megapixel IMX230 sensor. The newest flagship is expected to hit the streets in some markets by this week, since being released in September this year. Feature-rich in other elements too, with its 1080p 5.2-inch display, Snapdragon 810 SoC, 3GB, and 32GB of on-board storage. The Xperia Z5 runs Android 5.1 out of the box, which will be upgraded to  Android M  in the near future. If you’re taking 4K videos using the device, here’s where the microSD comes in (expandable up to 200GB), packing a solution to those huge files. That plus the 23-megapixel sensor that captures 5520 x 4120 resolution images, while its video capabilities range from 2160p/30fps down to 720p/120fps. Sony’s thrown in the regular bells and whistles too, with its phase-detection autofocus technology, LED flash, and HDR. Looks like more camera shootout comparisons will be coming your way, if this is anything to lead on. Impressively the Nexus 6P could appear out of nowhere as well, since DxOMark lists them at the current number two spot. LG and Samsung better watch out, cause these devices are potentially going to knock them off the podium. Here’s a breakdown at how the Xperia Z5 performed during the testing.     [  SOURCE  ]"

Claimed to push the boundaries of interaction with your smartphone, it features a pressure sensitive screen that expands features based on touch and it could even weigh an orange! Following its global announcement, we finally have new details of it making a surprise appearance on  SIRIM  – leading us to believe that the device will soon make its way to Malaysia. The device isn’t a one trick-pony, considering it boasts some decent specs to go along with its “force touch” technology. Housed inside the all metal-chasis, is a home-grown Kirin 935 8-core processor, mated to 3GB of RAM, all in a 5.5-inch package. Its screen is a FHD display (1920 x 1080) and has curves on the back that tee off slightly, while the front makes use of 2.5D Gorrila Glass 4 to smooth the edges. There are two variants of the devices but the model listed on SIRIM is the CRR-UL00 model which comes with dual-SIM and has a different band support. It also supports 4G LTE in either FDD and TDD standards.  But as a rough indication, the UK  Vmall  site is selling the 32GB version at £469.00, instead of its larger 64GB model. Based on  early reviews  in the UK, the Mate S in “Standard version” doesn’t come with the pressure sensitive display and it is said to be available later in a high-spec trim with 128GB of storage. So it is still a question mark whether we are getting the “Force Touch” high-spec version in Malaysia. In terms of its imaging, a 13-megapixel camera will support its photo taking on the rear, while the front gets a 8-megapixel shooter. The former is an f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with OIS and dual-LED flash. On the latter, its an f/2.4 shooter with an accompanying soft LED light for flash. Fans of gestures will ravel over the (for show) Knuckle sense technology. An upgraded 2.0 version allows you to draw a “C” shape to open the camera app – we’re unsure how many of you will take notice or even use this though. The metal-chasis on the back surrounds a distinctive Huawei shaped fingerprint sensor. From Apple to Samsung, the Mate S also shares the 3 microphone multi way conference recording feature as seen on the Galaxy Note 4. A feather weight of sorts at 156grams and 7.2mm thick, it still manages to pack a 2,700 mAh battery under all that metal. Android 5.1 will run the device’s OS but have a EMUI 3.1 skin to go on top. No official word on its pricing yet in Malaysia, nor has there been news on the release date but we’ll keep you in the loop. Thanks to tipster  @KelvinNgTK  for the heads up."

Arif Lee,Sony’s Xperia Z5 Premium future-proof for 4K but will display mainly in 1080p,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/02/sonys-xperia-z5-premium-future-proof-for-4k-but-will-display-mainly-in-1080p/,"4K,downgrade 1080p,Premium,Sony,sony 4k,Sony statement,Sony Xperia Z5 Premium,xperia z5,Xperia Z5 4K,Xperia Z5 Premium","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2015-10-02,"IFA  brought some great devices, but at the same time Sony was busy as well releasing their latest smart phones and the  Xperia Z5 Premium  was one of them. What blew most people away was the fact that Sony decided to pack a 4K display on the 5.5-inch device – a first in the smartphone industry. But it certainly isn’t cheap because native  4K content  isn’t easy to find. Sony’s latest statement answers some questions but we’ll have to see how well it attempts to levitate this problem. What the Japanese manufacturer attempts to do is downgrade non-4K content to a more reasonable 1080p, although it won’t sacrifice any proper 4K content, ensuring you’ll still get the most pixels. Here’s a snippet of what Sony said: They then offer an explanation as for why they decided to do so: It’s great that Sony has chosen to address these concerns and the reasons listed do make sense. Adding to that, the statement goes on to say that presently, the microSD slot handles cards up to 200GB just fine so 4K recordings won’t cause your phone’s memory to be maxed out so quickly. In the instance that you’ve yet to hear about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, let us jog your memory a bit. The device runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that’s surely to give you enough power to handle all your tasks. While it’s RAM is listed at 3GB and the internal storage is 32GB (expanded to the amount earlier stated). And yes, the screen is a 4K 5.5-inch that has a mind-blowing 806 PPI (3840 x 2160 resolution) The rear camera on the device (1/2.3″ 23-megapixel Exmor RS) has already received the seal of approval from Dxomark, who’ve rated the latest Sony smartphone the best-in-camera title – you’ll be able to read-up on that in a follow-up post. It’s battery is rated at 3430 mAh; rather big for regular phones but Sony would be the first to show how 4K screens will affect a device’s battery life – they however rate the battery to last up to 2 days (dependent on your personal usage habits, of course). The phone also features Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, so that should help giving your battery a quick boost if it needs it. You can check out our post  here  for more info about the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

This works on any smart phone, provided that the headphone jack is on top.  Announced  earlier this year  as a companion piece to the  ASUS  Zenflash, the Lolliflash is a Dual-Colour LED Flash accessory made to enhance your photos with close to natural lighting.The device itself comes in a variety of eyecatching colours and is available in White, Blue, Red and Yellow to suit your tastes. How the little colourful lollipop shaped device works is that it affixes itself to the headphone jack of your phone and acts as a dual-toned LED torch for natural toned selfies. The function is pretty similar to what’s already on the latest  Zenfone  devices. The device also comes with three coloured filters that you use by attaching to the face of the Lolliflash that adjusts the lighting tone. Said filters come in Blue, White and Pink and each enhances the lighting in its own way. It even charges via a tiny microUSB port at the back and has about three hours worth of battery life with continuous use. The Lolliflash doesn’t actually sync to your phone so you can essentially use it with any device that has a headphone jack, so you don’t need to pair it with an ASUS device to work. So would you  purchase  the Asus Lolliflash? tell us in the comments below."

Alexander Wong,Two is better than One: LG V10 is a new flagship phablet with dual screen and dual front cameras,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/10/01/lg-v10-officially-announced-phablet-flagship-dual-screen-dual-front-camera/,"Android,LG,LG Mobile,LG V10,LG V10 Launch,LG V10 Official,LG V10 Specs","Android,LG,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-10-01,"The awaited  LG V10  and it has quite similar underpinnings as the G4 but with a lot of new extras. At 5.7 inches, it is a phablet and could replace the ageing  G Pro 2 .  Boasting a multimedia rich experience, the biggest highlight of the V10 is its dual-screen approach. Unlike Samsung’s “Edge” display on the Galaxy Note Edge and S6 edge series, the secondary display is a tiny strip that’s placed at the front, at top right of the main screen. The always-on display which claims to have no impact on battery life and it can be used for status, shortcuts, displaying next appointment and more.  
 Like its current LG G4, it uses a Quad HD (2560×1440) IPS Quantum Display that’s bigger at 5.7 inches with a pixel density of 513ppi. Meanwhile the secondary ticker display is also a IPS Quantum Display unit with a 2.1″ unit doing 160×1040 pixel resolution. For better durability, the V10 has a Dura Guard frame that protects the display from hard bumps and tumbles. The frame is made of SAE grade 316L stainless steel and it protects the most vulnerable areas around the edge and corners. The back and bottom of the device gets a softer material called Dura Skin that’s resistant to scratches. With a grid pattern design, the V10 gets a more reassuring grip when held in the hands.  Under the hood, it gets a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor and it is mated with 4GB of LPDDR-3 RAM. For imaging, it retains a similar 16MP f/1.8 camera as the LG G4 that also comes with OIS 2.0. In addition, it also gets 3 directional mics which you can be manipulated fully with its Manual Video mode. If you love taking 4K videos, storage shouldn’t be an issue with a 64GB of on-board storage and it still comes with a microSD slot supporting up to 2TB. For the professionals, it has an extensive manual mode and you can even shoot videos in 21:9 aspect ratio.  Over at the front, LG wants to take Selfie and Groufie pictures to the next level with not one but two 5MP cameras with each doing 80 degree and 120 degree wide angle respectively. With the two cameras combined, it can produce a wide angle shot without the need of having a selfie stick. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which is also removable. In terms of connectivity, it supports Cat 6 4G LTE, 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC and it still uses microUSB 2.0. Overall it is 8.6mm thick and it weighs quite a heft at 192g, similar to an iPhone 6s Plus. The LG V10 will be available starting in Korea this month and it will be released later in other regions including Asia, US, China, Latin America and Middle East. Looks like a complete package if you’re looking for a phablet for videos and photos, don’t you think? After all, the camera of the LG G4 is a  top pick  as chosen by our readers. [  SOURCE  ]"

Placed to fill a gap in the non-metal phones of this year, the Butterfly 3 packs a great package with HTC’s signature dual rear camera setup in a lesser premium outer layer. For a pretty penny, the Butterfly 3 is filled with internals that beg the question, if priced so highly, why not just make metal-clad? It’s been tough for the Taiwanese company to make profits and since September, they’ve been  dropped  from the main Taiwan stock index (TWSE 50). Problems don’t just stop there, as the company announced that they would lay off nearly 15% of their global workforce. Market strategies aside, HTC Butterfly 3 is a 5.2-inch device; it’s screen is a QHD LCD display (2560 x 1440). Occupying the processor slot inside the device is an Octa-core Snapdragon 810, while the RAM sits at 3GB. For your storage you’ll get a decent 32GB internally but if you need a boost, you can always take advantage of the microSD slot. The star of the show of the Butterfly line has always been its camera optics, and the third generation device a Duo camera setup; 20.2-megapixels as the primary camera and a secondary lens to help with those bokeh shots. Protected by sapphire crystal it boasts an f/2.2 aperture and a dual-LED module sits on the left of the main sensor. Selfie taking individuals will be pleased as on the front you’ll see a 13-megapixel shutter with a BSI sensor. In terms of aperture, the front lens steps it up a bit with an f/2.0 lens instead. If you prefer videos, the rear sensor gets you 4K quality and the front is capable of 1080p films. Aesthetically, the Boomsound speaker grills are slightly thinner this time around, giving it a sleaker look but still maintaining its large bezels on the top and bottom. Powering the HTC Butterfly 3 is a 2,700 mAh battery and the smartphone has a IP rating of 57, ensuring that it’ll be slightly dust and water resistant. It also has a single 4G LTE SIM slot. Android 5.0 Lollipop is behind the device’s OS but has an overlay of HTC’s Sense 7. The device launches in Taiwan on the 20 th  of October for TWD 19,.900 (RM 2,657) though no word yet on international availability. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Among the repercussions were the removal of  iFixit ‘s developer account that was attached to the app, thus getting it removed as well. This dismissal of sorts were caused by iFixit receiving a developer unit and risking it by tearing down the device that has yet to go on sale. While being dissembled, the people behind the website released info of the internals down to their model numbers, as they usually do. If you’re not familiar with iFixit, they’re the people behind the DIY fixing website for Apple products; they provide how-to’s and even provide the parts for self-repairs (if you’re desperate to look elsewhere). So far, they’ve released an official statement explaining the whole commotion that lead to Apple banning them. They explained that they knew the risk associated with going-ahead to tear down the Apple TV and the fact that “teardowns are in our DNA”, they couldn’t resist. Fittingly, Apple wasn’t too pleased but were fair to weigh the aforementioned decision against the repairing maestros and sent them a follow up e-mail explaining their offences; in-turn, banning the iFixit developer account with the app in tow. It isn’t all bad news though, as the team announced that their mobile site is essentially the exact same thing as the app; allowing the full functionality on the website. Adding that, due to the team being really small, they don’t have enough resources to keep the app up-to-date. Currently, they’ve no plans to rewrite their app, however the readily available APIs allow whoever wants to take up the task as the team has already given their seal of approval – since it’s open source. Meanwhile, the Android app still lives on and access to the repair guides are accessible on their existing mobile site. Watch the trouble-making teardown video below. [  SOURCE  ]"

HTC’s new device is pretty much the same ol’ M9+ but the Supreme Camera edition gets a new 21-megapixel camera updated with OIS and laster auto focus. Adding the laster auto focus however, now occupies the former secondary camera module, which this time has been left out. Touted to deliver 0.1 second focus speeds, the camera is now enabled with phase detection. Everything else, is literally the same; no we’re not kidding.

The brand has decided to take the fight to the selfie market with the release of the  ASUS Zenfone Selfie , a selfie-centric device with a huge rear and front combo. The Zenfone Selfie shares a lot in common with its predecessor the  ASUS Zenfone 2 , sporting roughly the same looks and layout with its older counterpart. It even has the same curved back design as the Zenfone 2 but curved at a lesser degree to make it wobble less when lying flat. The Selfie also comes in some pastel colour options if you want to stray away from the usual black-red-silver covers. There’s matte white, powder blue and pastel pink colours to choose from. As far as the specs go, the Selfie is on par with quite a few devices, but is slightly lower specced than the top of the line Zenfone 2. This puts it in roughly the same segment as the  OPPO R7  and the  Lenovo Vibe Shot  which all sport 3GB of RAM."
Alexander Wong,Google Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P announced with Marshmallow out of the box,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/30/google-nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p-announced-with-marshmallow-out-of-the-box/,"Android,Android 6.0,Android M,google,Google Nexus,Google Nexus 5X,Google Nexus 6P,Huawei Nexus 6P,LG Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X,Nexus 5X Launch,Nexus 6P,Nexus 6P Launch","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,nexus 5,Nexus 6",2015-09-30,"There’s a saying that good things come in pairs. And that appears to be the formula for new flagships like the Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ and the more recent iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The Nexus project has always been a showcase of what Google can do if they have full control on both hardware and software.  In its 7th Nexus smart phone generation along with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, they had introduced not one but 2 Nexus smart phones that cater towards different users. With very little introduction required, the Nexus 5X is their new compact “flagship” while the Nexus 6P is their crème de la crème with a 5.7″ phablet form factor and top spec underpinnings.  With LG being called up for another Nexus duty, the Nexus 5X is an upgrade over its previous Nexus 5 that’s encased in a premium injected molded polycarbonate body. The screen gets a slightly larger 5.2″ size but it still does a modest Full HD resolution. In terms of power, it manages to pull through with a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor that’s also powering the LG G4. It only gets 2GB RAM with an option of either 16GB or 32GB storage.  Looking at the rear, the Nexus 5X gets a main 12.3MP camera which claims to outdo its better specced rivals. While there are cameras out there with higher pixel count, the 12.3MP shooter from Sony boasts a larger 1.55 μm pixel size, which is pretty much the same formula as HTC’s Ultrapixel shooter.  The main camera has a f/2.0 aperture lens, dual flash light and an IR laser AF for quicker focus. For the front, it gets a rather standard 5MP f/2.0 camera with 1.4 μm pixel size. Audio is pushed from a single speaker that’s firing from the front.  Connectivity wise, it supports a wide range of networks covering Cat 6 4G LTE in TDD and FDD spectrums. It also has WiFi 802.11ac in 2×2 MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC support as standard. For better security, the rear mounted fingerprint scanner that’s called the Nexus Imprint lets you unlock by a mere touch. It recognises in under 600 ms and it learns to get better each time it is being put to use.  Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh battery that’s rated for all day use and it charges up using USB Type C that supports Quick Charge. The Nexus 5X is available for pre-orders at selected markets with the 16GB version priced from US$379 (about RM1,690). As seen in earlier leaks, this is the first Nexus phone produced by Huawei. Apart from being a new appointed Nexus maker, it is also the first all metal Nexus smart phone and it boasts a rather slender 7.3mm thickness.  With Huawei being reluctant of pushing a Quad HD smart phones, the Nexus 6P breaks that tradition with a 5.7″ Quad HD display that pushes a stunning 518ppi. To protect the display from harm, it gets toughen with Gorilla Glass 4 and there’s an added oleophobic coating for smudge resistance. The design looks like an odd mix between a Huawei P8 and an honor 7 especially with that visible camera bump. For audio playback, it does get a pair of front firing speakers and recording is assisted by 3 microphones that double up for noise cancellation.  Under the hood, the Nexus 6P runs on a Snapdragon 810 processor mated with 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. You get more storage options ranging from 32GB, 64GB and 128GB which are also non-expandable. The list of connectivity support, Nexus Imprint and USB Type C are similar as the Nexus 5X but the same 12.3MP camera gets an extra trick of having to support a higher Slow Motion recording of 240FPS. Taking selfies should be better as well as the 6P gets a higher 8MP f/2.4 shooter.  In terms of battery, it gets a phablet category 3,450mAh capacity unit which is fitting for the specs it carries. The Nexus 6P is priced from US$499 which is roughly RM2,225 in our current rates.  Both models are quite pricey when compared to mainstream Android smart phones but for the Android purist that want to get the very latest Android might appreciate one of these Marshmallow preloaded smart phones.

Arif Lee,Research shows that Malaysians love mobile-multitasking,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/29/google-research-shows-that-malaysians-love-to-be-mobile-multitaskers/,"e-commerce,google,Google Consumer Barometer 2015,Google e-commerce,Google smartphone survey,Google+ Malaysia,Malaysia smartphone,Malaysia smartphone penetration,Malaysia smartphone trends,Malaysia trends,smartphone penetration,TNS Infratest","Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-29,"Partnering with TNS Infratest who handled the research and analysis of this year’s edition of the report; a survey was held in over 50 countries around the world with 400,000 individual assessments conducted. Seemingly, Asia as a continent is showing a propensity to put aside their PCs to solely rely on their smartphones for their online needs – be it shopping, learning, searching and etc. So Google being Google, they’re tasked to illustrate an image to show how people use the Internet – as quoted by MD SEA Sajith. Essentially, the research serves to encapsulate the behaviours of the world while connecting to their devices – these instances are dubbed “micro-moments” and so far they’re transcending markets in Asia. How hooked are we? Well the insights show that 66% of all Asians own a smartphone, numbers that aren’t trumped by any other region; Americas and Europe are 60% each. Our neighbours down south (Singapore) sit high and mighty with 88%, the country with the fastest internet (South Korea) are at 83%, while Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia come in at 79%, 78% and 77% respectively – Malaysia’s percentile was at 71%. Malaysia’s data shows some trends that might be worrying; to sum it up, Malaysians could be likely to have ADHD, or rather just find it hard to concentrate on one thing – in this case, device for a span of time. Coming in at number 2 thanks to logging a percentile of 91% Malaysia was only beaten by Indonesia (92%); numbers that show that both countries have individuals that use their smartphones while watching the TV. Numbers which implicate that these two nations are either: Then on, the data also shows that 36% of Malaysians only use their pocket companions and nothing else to surf the web – again number two, behind Thailand 37%. It seems that it could be that the portability of their smartphones are driving them away from tablets and computers. Buying habits are now also being dictated through smartphones, although the numbers aren’t too high at 20%. Supplementing this data are more percentages that corroborate that e-commerce is still quite stagnant in the country. 51% of Malaysians prefer to do their groundwork on their purchases online but purchasing the actual item offline. The internet is helping them find out what they need and compare on the internet but knowing Asians, they still want to take a proper look at the thing they’re putting their money towards. Another interesting trend is that 48% of our citizens find out about products through online resources, first. E-commerce as an industry is still finding it hard to tackle the local consumer, but they’ll be happy to know that 30% of Malaysians are shopping online through other mediums (PCs, tablets, etc). Coming to a close, it’s no surprise that the majority of smartphone users come from Gen Y or younger (under 25; 93%) but these numbers are increasing in all age ranges. Some time during this article you’d probably compare yourself and decide if you fall within the majority; nevertheless, consumers could expect more content to be marketed based on these findings, so be prepared for interactive content that spreads across multiple-platforms.

They’re more productive than regular mobile devices; the commonality? A keyboard. Yes, the way we type dictate how productive we are, or at least for the time being. So since we’ve seen that drafting long-winded text has always been a headache-inducing experience; hence, Google has reworked their existing Pixel brand to encase a new screen and bluetooth keyboard combination in the form of the Pixel C(onvertible). Could this be a direct answer to the dwindling tablet sales? Convergence devices have a chance to occupy some market share and it seems that most manufacturers are coming up with some sort of variation to tackle this problem. Omitting kickstands and clasps, yet maintaining its rigidity, the device attempts to be a tablet but combining the keyboard through magnets allows you to immediately start your full-on typing jobs. Adjustable to angles from 100 to 135 degrees, when attached, the presentation showed that you can handle it in an array of angles, not coming apart even without being grounded. As an add-on, the bluetooth linked keyboard decreases pitch of the key size from the regular keyboard’s 19mm (13-inch), to the Pixel C’s 18.8mm pitch; the size of keys center to center from each other. It also features a 1.4mm key travel, so typing won’t be too annoying. Stowing the typing add-on is easy, simply placing it under the tablet. Battery-wise it charges inductively when closed through the tablet itself, and a few minutes a day will keep the small keyboard’s battery fully charged, otherwise the keyboard will last for roughly 2 months. In terms of the tablet’s internals, it pushes a 2560 x 1800 pixel resolution through its aforementioned 10.2-inch screen that’s capable of 500 nits of brightness. Running the engine is a quad-core Nvidia Tegra X1 processor with a Maxwell GPU, mated with 3GB of RAM. Internal storage options are available in two choices; 32GB and 64GB. You’ll charge the new Google device through the USB Type-C port, and it has a nifty way of showing the battery percentage, just tap twice on the light bar and it’ll show you a gauge of the current percentage. As for software, it’ll run Android OS leaving out ChromeOS out in the cold. Beckoning the question – are they going to market this solely as a combo? Or will they let the tablet do most of the talking? As is, Android tablets have already had third-party options that allow users to add-on a keyboard, so this is nothing spectacularly new from Google. Some details have been left-out for the time being – like the camera optics, type of screen, and battery size but more info will likely be released at a later date to keep anticipation high. The device today was just teased and Google hopes to release the device by the holiday season. Fortunately, they didn’t withhold pricing and they’ve announced it’ll cost you $499/RM 2,211 (32GB), $599/RM 2,654 (64GB) and $149/RM 660 for the bluetooth keyboard add-on. Google has set up a product page but for now its really bare bones, you can check it out  here . Here’s the Google Keynote below (skip over to 1:11:28 for the Pixel C)"
Arif Lee,Make entertainment smarter with Google’s new Chromecast devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/30/make-entertainment-smarter-with-googles-2015-chromecast-and-chromecast-audio/,"Chromecast,Chromecast 2015,Chromecast Audio,google,Google annoucement,Google Chromecast 2015,Google Chromecast Audio,Google Nexus,Hi-Fi,speaker,stream stick,TV","Android,Cool stuff,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-30,"Ousting the 2 year old version, the new 2015 Chromecast is set to once again offer a better way to make your regular devices smarter; unspecific to it just being a TV anymore, with the Chromecast Audio. Coming in at a small form factor of 39.1grams the new streaming stick and its new music-inclined sibling now boast an improved WiFi frequency support,  redesigned  to now be a circle and include an integrated HDMI cable. The pre-existing Chromecast used to look much like a stick with a HDMI head, opting for something a little more discrete and easier to plug in, Google has decided to switch to an integrated cable system to make the device easier plug in to hard-to-reach TV ports. The modern-looking Chromecast 2015 now adds support for a wider WiFi frequency; extending to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz with 802.11 ac bands. These bands have allowed Google to prove that the new device adapts to your WiFi surroundings in your home, giving you the best connection at any given time. Hardware aside, its app experience is now tweaked to give you a better overall time while using the device. Content is now shown on a home-screen but only caters to your personal app list, so if you don’t have a certain app, content from it won’t be shown. Though, through content discovery, it’ll show you the available apps that have the content you’ve choose to search for. Picking up (to) Full HD content on apps like Google Play, YouTube, Spotify and Netflix, users will surely have a lot of shows and movies to choose from. The updated Chromecast app wasn’t that slow to begin with but thanks to a pre-fetching option called “Fast Play”, app developers can allow their systems to decrease app load-times (80% faster in a test). Intrinsically, this pre-fetching extends further to utilise algorithms to pre-download content based on your behaviour – e.g. downloading a small bit of a new episode based on your current episode list. What about mobile gaming? Well, gaming is supported too, casting your screen onto your larger screen – now allowing multiplayer options that let users use their devices as controllers. Google also announced its audio only option with similar capabilities; the Chromecast Audio. As mentioned earlier, it’ll make your regular devices a little smarter, allowing you to repurpose your older expensive Hi-Fi systems by making them a streaming machine – similarly to a bluetooth speaker BUT you won’t be interrupted by phone calls anymore, since the device can run on its own without disturbing your listening. Owners can choose from an extensive list of apps like iHeart Radio, Pandora, Google Play Music (not available in Malaysia), Spotify and etc. Google aims to add to their Chromecast Audio app list throughout its lifetime. Some other perks when comparing it to a bluetooth speaker would be less battery drain, ability to use multiple cross-platform devices to control your “new” smart-er speaker. Sharing is enabled through audio sharing on the app that gives users on the same network the capability to control music options on the Chromecast Audio. Best thing is, casting is done on the app you’re playing your music from, so you won’t need to learn an entirely new app just to play music. Later in the year an OTA update will even allow multi-room audio, syncing all your speakers to play from one source. Both devices are readily available in 17 countries (Malaysia left-out) but only cost $35 each (RM 156) and come in 3 colour options – Lemonade, Coral and Black. The devices work with computers or mobile devices that use Android 4.1+, iOS 7.0+, Windows 7, or Mac OS X 10.7 and ChromeOS We’ll be sure to update everyone if/when the two devices come to Malaysia.

U Mobile which started to offer the iPhone 6  not too long ago  has commenced its registration of interest for the latest iPhone duo.  Both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be offered in either 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage options with a choice of 4 colours including the new Rose Gold. In the registration form, you would need to select your preferred pick up point which is available in the Klang Valley, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru, Melaka, Seremban, Kuantan, Penang, Ipoh, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching. The official release for the iPhone 6s in Malaysia is on the 16th October and we can only assume that you could collect by then.

A selling strategy that conjured up to ensure that they sell products at an extremely small profit margin. Their stint so far has proven that while people really want to buy their devices, they can’t keep up with the demand. So much so till it has driven Carl Pei to ask Samsung for an internship position, so he’ll be able to learn about being a bigger name in the market. The Shenzen based company, has faced a lot of hurdles since coming to existence in December 2013. They’ve suffered immense pressure to keep up the supply chain, and even daring to declare themselves as the “2016 Flagship Killer”. Maybe Mr Pei’s intentions of heading to Samsung would be to see how they incorporate Fast Charging in their devices; considering OnePlus didn’t include any form of the technology in their 2 devices or perhaps get some insider info on how to kill Samsung’s flagship in 2016. He’s even gone on record on his personal blog, stating that since the OnePlus 2, he’s learned important lessons from not meeting demands of orders. Adding that the company is working overtime just to get their newest device into the hands of their owners. It’s a given really when you intend to have a “one-hour open sale” that caused those on the invite-list to go mad – why have an open sale when you can’t even sell to those already waiting. We’re still not sure if they have a proper team handling marketing but at least they’ve set out to disrupt the market. Tipping the scales in favour of the consumer, so we’ll have to give lift our hats in that aspect. If the industry evolves, there’s likely room for more competition amongst the respective manufacturers – loosely quoting Carl Pei. But this is when it takes the cake, he goes on to say :- We’ll let you be the judge if this is an honest attempt at reaching out or just another stunt that could lead the brand further down the rabbit hole. Subsequently, the guys at Android Authority managed to dig up Pei’s LinkedIn account, which shows that the Co-founder has been around. Take a look at the photo below. These  kids could offer Carl some insights on how to successfully get an internship opportunity at Samsung. Take some pointers Mr Pei, they’re way ahead of you. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

This is the Piston 3.0 which succeeds its current  Piston 2.1  version, that’s priced at RM50.  The new Mi Piston 3.0 is totally redesigned and gone is the metal chambers that usually come in gold, opting for a more ergonomic design with the use of durable plastic. While the previous version was straight, the new version slopes downward slightly with a 120 degree tilt outwards for a comfortable fit.  The diaphragm in the ear piece uses an aerospace-grade metal composite material that’s sandwiched between its PET layers for a more balanced output. For optimal mid-range and bass performance, the sound chambers now has a new spiral air flow design which seems to direct sound better into your ear.  Designed for smart phone usage, the Mi Piston 3.0 also comes with a microphone module that has your typical volume up, down and selection button. Unlike the previous version where the mic is placed at the splitting end of the cord, it is now located on the right side cable, about 3 inches below the ear piece. The cable still uses kevlar fibre that’s encased in a braided sleeve for better durability.  From our long term use, the Piston 3.0 is more sleek in design and we find it to fit better in most ears. We know of some users complaining that the metal chambers of the current Piston 2.1 seem to hurt their ears during long usage, and it seems that the new ergonomic design has solved that. Noise isolation is a lot better and terms of quality, the mid-rangers are clearer while the bass is more warmer and full bodied. Overall, this is quite an improvement and the RM19 extra is definitely worth spending. If you’re interested, head over to the Mi Store to place your orders. The sale starts today, 29th September at 12:00PM on the official  Mi Store .  [  SOURCE  ]"

Sometime down the line the Finnish company decided to sell off 90% of its stakes to a company by the name of EQT VI; who works around the concept of making devices as fashion accessories. Think, Richard Mille, Patek Philippe, Franck Muller and the likes, in the watch making industry; similarly the Vertu Signature Touch aims to occupy the same segment, just for smartphones instead. The prices of their newest devices can fetch from between £6,500 all the way to £13,700, a hefty price for a smart phone. Now with premium prices, you’d expect a premium product, so what goes into making a smart phone that costs roughly the price of a compact car? First off, we’ll take a look at its exterior (yes, we’re treating this like a car impression); the device is fashioned out of expensive materials (go figure), you’ll get polished Grade 5 titanium – the kind you see in the high-end automotive and aerospace industry. Then we have a 130 carat sapphire crystal display ensuring you’ll have the “best” viewing experience. Lastly, the material that surrounds most of the smart phone is leather, and not just any type of leather; we’re talking calfskin, lizard and alligator hides from the best tanneries in Europe. But wait, what about its specs? In this department, the Signature Touch is no slouch either, accompanying its expensive exterior is a 64-bit Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, mated with 4GB of RAM. It’s screen is a 5.2-inch Full HD display, protected by the aforementioned sapphire crystal, while the internal memory is supported by 64GB of storage and features a MicroSD slot (support up to 2TB) that comes with a 64GB card inside. The device’s rear camera stands at a pretty 21-megapixels with phase detect autofocus and a twin Dual-tone LED flash providing better colour accuracy when lit. Moving over to the front, you’ll get a satisfactory 2.1-megapixel wide aperture sensor for those (expensive) selfies. Vertu’s Signature Touch promises to pack a punch when audio is concerned, thanks to its duo of stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Digital Plus surround sound decoding. For connectivity its equipped with the full WiFi spectrum (a/b/g/n/ac), as well as Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and 4G LTE to boot. Under its titanium housing, you’ll be pleased to find a 3,160 mAh battery that’s readily compatible with Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 and also Qi wireless charging. Capping off the smartphone’s specs is the software it runs – Android 5.1 Lollipop with some added Vertu extras bundled with the device. So once you’ve put down that huge wad of cash on the Signature Touch,, it’s expected that it offers you a little more than just being your mobile device; well yes, Vertu has felt the same way, handing its owners an exclusive ruby cut key that gives you access to their added services that include: The phone is available for pre-order in a selected few Vertu boutiques from the 28 th  of September till the 8 th  of October, while the device officially goes on sale on October the 16 th . The aforementioned prices (£6,500/RM 43,394 to £13,700/RM 91,605) will depend on which options of metal and leather you’ve chosen on your personalised Signature Touch.

Alexander Wong,More Microsoft Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL details leaked ahead of launch,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/27/more-microsoft-lumia-950-and-lumia-950-xl-details-leaked-ahead-of-launch/,"Lumia 950,Lumia 950 XL,Microsoft Lumia 950,Microsoft Lumia 950 XL,Windows 10,Windows 10 Mobile,windows phone","Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Windows Phone",2015-09-27,"UPDATE : Added a clearer Lumia 950 XL product image courtesy of @evleaks.  6th October will be a big day for Microsoft as they would be  announcing the latest  Microsoft Surface Pro 4 as well as their new flagship Lumia smart phones. Just like the Nexus 6P, a couple of slides have leaked from what appears to be an internal presentation of the latest Lumia 950 and Lumix 950 XL flagship smart phones.  NokiaForever  initially posted these images but they were later  taken them down .   The details revealed have reaffirmed a couple of  speculations  we’ve heard before. Both Lumia 950 and 950 XL will have Quad HD displays, 20MP Pure View cameras and they will use the new future-proof reversible USB Type C port. While Microsoft is yet to jump onto the fingerprint scanning bandwagon, these new flagships are shown with Iris scanning built-in for  Windows Hello . In terms of OS, they would be the first to run on Windows 10 mobile, in line with its current Windows 10 push.  The Lumia 950 is the smaller version of the lot with a 5.2″ AMOLED display and under the hood, it gets a Snapdragon 808  Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. It will come with 32GB of on-board storage which fortunately is still expandable with microSD. The back gets a 20MP Pureview camera assisted with dual-LED flash while the front will carry a 5MP selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports Qi Wireless charging like its predecessors.  Meanwhile the Lumia 950 XL is a larger phablet sized sibling with a 5.7″ AMOLED display. The screen isn’t the only feature that’s upsized as it gets a top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM with 32GB of on-board storage. While the main camera is the same 20MP PureView unit, the 950 XL gets an extra boost with a triple LED flash light. For selfies, it still retains the same 5MP shooter as the Lumia 950. With a larger screen, the battery has a slightly bigger capacity at 3,300mAh. It has been a while since Microsoft had launched a flagship smart phone and this is probably the biggest upgrade that matches up with its Android rivals. The Microsoft event is  happening  on 6th October at 10:00PM Malaysian time.  [  SOURCE   2  ]"
Alexander Wong,ZTE brings its Axon flagship to Malaysia with a working Iris Recognition Scanner,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/28/zte-brings-its-axon-flagship-to-malaysia-with-a-working-iris-recognition-scanner/,"Android,Axon Malaysia,Dual Sim,ZTE,zte axon,ZTE Axon Elite,ZTE Axon Elite Malaysia,ZTE Axon Launch,ZTE Axon Malaysia,ZTE Axon Malaysia Launch,ZTE Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,ZTE",2015-09-28,"ZTE isn’t really known for making a flagship smart phone but now they are trying to enter the high-end segment with its new Axon. Launched today for the Malaysian market, we are getting the Axon Elite which comes with a 5.5″ Full HD IPS display and a top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.  In terms of design, it gets a unibody aluminium back with some faux leather elements for the top and bottom. Size wise, it feels quite compact for a 5.5 incher. Over at the front, the display along with its 3 capacitive buttons are flanked by a pair of “metal girder” design grills.  For imaging, it gets a pair of cameras at the back which consists of a 13MP main and a 2MP secondary unit. Meanwhile at the front, it gets a 8MP camera which also doubles up as an iris scanner dubbed as EyePrint ID.  To unlock using your eyes, it isn’t instant as you would need to swipe downwards on the lock screen and wait for about 2-3 seconds for it to work its magic. Alternatively you could also unlock with a fingerprint scanner that’s mounted at the back or via its voice recognition feature.  The ZTE Axon Elite also boast a AKM 4961 HiFi Chip, NFC and a dual-SIM slot which doubles up as a microSD expansion on the 2nd SIM tray. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery which supports QuickCharge 2.0. At the moment, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and it comes only in Ion Gold colour. The ZTE Axon Elite is priced at RM1,999 and it will be available sometime in mid-October. Being the underdog in the flagship space, the price is quite steep considering there are plenty of high-end devices in this price range."
Arif Lee,BlackBerry CEO struggles with the new Android-running Priv (Venice) in a hands-on video,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/28/blackberry-ceo-struggles-with-the-new-android-running-priv-venice-in-a-hands-on-video/,"Android,blackberry,BlackBerry Android,BlackBerry Android Device,BlackBerry Android Smart Phone,BlackBerry PRIV,Blackberry Slider,BlackBerry Smart Phone,BlackBerry Venice","Android,BlackBerry,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-28,"Once a brand identifies itself and sets habits, they’re often hard to get rid of. Especially so when John Chen, CEO of BlackBerry tried his hand at the demo-unit of the new BlackBerry Priv; the first Android running device from the manufacturer. Well it’s safe to say that Mr. Chen uses a BlackBerry (10) himself, seeing he tried to swipe up in the video you’ll see below. Providing an exclusive hands-on, the CEO talked about how the brand identifies to give its customers privacy, security and privilege, while handling the device – that wasn’t set up yet. The short time with the device was spent more on how the company has decided to give other OS’ a go, since they can’t keep up with competitors’ app ecosystem. He also gave us a look at the slider in action, mentioning that the QWERTY keyboard will have capacitive keys. Recapping the rumoured specs, the Priv runs a 6-core Snapdragon 808 processor and 3GB of RAM under the hood. Curved in nature (a first for BlackBerry) the 5.5-inch screen is purported to display in Quad HD resolution. For its camera, it’ll be sporting an 18-megapixel rear shutter with dual-LED flash, while the front gets a 5-megapixel camera. As you saw on the video, the Priv runs Android; apparently 5.0 but it’ll also have some of the BlackBerry exclusive apps like BlackBerry Hub. A stumble for sure, perhaps BlackBerry could’ve asked their top technology guy to handle the preview of the device instead. Hopefully they’ll buck up during their launch presentation, or at least get the demo unit set up properly – as it is estimated to launch around November. If you’re a BlackBerry user, tell us what you think about the notion of switching over to Android in the comments below. [  SOURCE  ]"

Inventions and breakthroughs revolving around the realm of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) have pushed humans to be a more tech centric society. Our lives are now more reliant on technology to tackle the issues and problems that we face – in medicine, teaching impairments, home tech, and etc. An avenue to power these solutions and ideas has already been in the works with Samsung lending a platform through its Solve for Tomorrow competition globally held in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore and now, Malaysia. A competition that challenges the minds and market-savviness of university students in the aforementioned disciplines to provide conceptualised solutions tasked at handling topical issues and day-to-day STEM related challenges faced by Malaysians. Facilitating these ideas through the competition platform that pits 20 teams to pitch their concepts to a panel that have been in the industry long enough to tell whether these ideas are worth investing in. A final third tier pitching conducted earlier this month was to narrow down the 20 groups to a top 10 public presentation and to a final 3 groups that stand to receive a RM 20,000 (each) seed grant; Samsung Malaysia has also taken upon themselves to provide an internship experience and devices to go along with their learning trip to Samsung HQ, in South Korea. Judging their pitches and works of innovation are a panelist of 5 well-versed individuals: Teams were given only 5 minutes to present their ideas together with their stage 3 beta prototypes, followed by another 5 minutes for a Q&A session with the panelist above. Taking the stage, the 10 groups sent their representatives each having to showcase their prototypes and address the problems they chose to tackle. An unassuming trend was starting to form when they announced the winning top 3; all of them had their own ways of benefiting the field of medicine. In no particular order, the winners were: Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (LEE)  – a mechanical based exoskeleton that serves to help those with walking impairments, enabling them to stand and walk for longer periods. The group of boys from TARUC Selangor managed to get their 3 rd  prototype to only cost RM 150 (approx) and be light enough to promote ease of use. Flex Controlled Electrical Wheelchair  – based at the same university as previously mentioned group, this team managed to put together an electronic wheelchair that utilises a flex sensing technology to allow motorised movement through bending movements. It will be meant for disabled groups that have difficulty in moving their hands to adjust joysticks of the current generation of motorised wheelchairs. Interactive and Portable Rehabilitation for the Disabled (IPRD)  – a device purposed towards rehab patients going through physiotherapy, data can be recorded and analysed on the sensors’ attachment to determine rate of fatigue and instances when muscles fail. The wearable device interacts with computer or mobile games that uses motion controls through Bluetooth; making the whole experience a lot more fun and gratifying.  Some noteworthy groups that didn’t make the top 3 include the following: Insects’ Zapper  – a team of foundation students from TARUC that defined the current-age of fly-swatters and insect zappers to be a level below their own creation; a bendable zapper that improves efficiency to rid homes and other spaces of flying insects. This young team’s focus was to lessen energy exertion while improving the device’s impact resistance. A feat that lead them winning the people’s choice awards. Mosquito Buster  – an ultrasonic humidifying system that uses a combination of water and lemongrass to repel mosquitoes from inhibiting a large area. The team from UNITEN tested their prototypes around campus (a top 10 dengue site) and after which, cases were non-existent. 6-Sense  – a passive way of detecting blood glucose levels; an amazing invention made for diabetic patients that have to face constant finger pricking and blood-testing to monitor their sugar levels. The wearable system itself is in the form of a glove, enhanced by infrared sensors to detect blood glucose under the skin. However, KDU student Lim Wai Xiang didn’t manage to get the prototype to work when demonstrating earlier in the day. At Malaysia’s first Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition they saw 108 submissions from their 5 Demo Days held at selected universities across 5 states. Next year they hope to make it greater and bigger to allow more public and private university students a chance at solving the society’s STEM related problems.

Apple has officially announced that Malaysia will be getting the  iPhone 6s  and  iPhone 6s Plus  on the 16th October. This will be 3 weeks after its initial first wave release in countries including Singapore, Australia, US and the UK. In its  recent release , Apple claims to have sold more than 13 million units of the latest iPhone 6s/6s Plus in the first 3 days, which sets a new record. For the month of October, 40 more countries will join the list beginning with its 2nd wave on 9th October, followed by the 3rd wave in 10th October and finally the 4th wave on 16th October which includes Malaysia. The following are the full release schedule: If you’ve been resisting  the temptation  to pick up an imported unit, looks like your patience has paid off. With the official launch date announced, we should be seeing a drop in pricing in the days to come. This is probably the fastest iPhone roll out yet as we are getting it within a month since its global release. Price wise, do expect to pay more especially with the recent  price hike  and our poor exchange rate against  other countries .  The new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are visibly the same as the previous iPhone 6/6 Plus with the exception of a new Rose Gold colour as pictured above. However it gets a significant upgrade underneath with an improved aluminium 7000 shell while the display has 3D touch which is similar to the Apple Watch’s Force Touch. The performance claims to be double of its predecessor with a new A9 chip that’s mated with 2GB of RAM.  For taking pictures, the iPhone 6s gets a larger 12MP main sensor while the iPhone 6s Plus model gets added Optical Image Stabilisation. For selfies, you can expect better and brighter pictures with a 5MP front cam which uses the Retina Display as a soft flash in low light situations.

As the squeaky ball is round, it’ll work in either orientation, be it front-facing selfies, or rear camera portraits. Well, this idea is a good one, provided that your pet is actually attracted to the ball though if it starts to lose interest, the ball squeaks – yet again all depending on how amused your pet is.

So far they have made 2 version, the  first edition  for the Galaxy Note 4 and  an updated version  that supports the Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Today they have just announced a new one, and not only it fits the latest  flagship phablets  but it also more affordable than before. Dubbed as the Gear VR Consumer Version, it is now compatible with more devices as it supports the Galaxy Note5, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge. From the appearance, it looks the same as the  Gear VR Innovator Edition  which  we’ve reviewed  but there are some notable differences. Firstly it loses the top strap that goes across your head, leaving just the side straps to secure the Gear VR in place. While on the right side, it gets a redesigned touch pad that has visible directional groves which supposedly give you better controls. Still retained is a back button and a volume rocker that’s placed near the front. In terms of experience, the specs remain unchanged with a 96 degree field of view and a 54-70mm IPD Coverage. For a little sight correction, there’s also an adjustment dial that’s located at the top.  The new Gear VR only comes in Frost While and it will be available this quarter globally at only US$99 (About RM434). That’s almost half the price of the  current Gear VR  Innovator Edition for the S6 that’s priced at RM799.

The positive ones that come to mind would be its camera capabilities, good performance (for an 808 SoC), and satisfactory QHD screen. Consequently, according to this rumour, LG wants to build on what it has going for itself but don’t expect it to be out so soon; probably sometime in Q1 next year. Quoting an anonymous report from an insider, the G5 will have the best of what Qualcomm and Sony has to offer, in the processing and camera department. The latter is supposedly going to be an LG exclusive sensor made by Sony; all 20-megapixels worth, boasting a half an inch diagonal size sensor (the biggest yet). Comparing the current-gen lot below: So we’ve  compared  the top end cameras of the smart phone world and you guys decided that more pixels don’t necessarily mean the best photos, in real life scenarios. It doesn’t help either that manufacturers place an absurd amount of emphasis on the number of pixels a camera carries. Problems at the time with Qualcomm’s hot Snapdragon 810 processor saw LG look off and choose the 808 SoC instead; lets keep our fingers crossed that the 820 is the product of Qualcomm learning from their past and they’ve managed to keep it cool. So it’s safe to say the LG G5 will deliver in processing power – however there have been  leaks  of LG developing its own signature chipset. Rumours are rumours, so don’t be too excited for now; nonetheless, we’ll wait till Q1 2016 to see if there’s any weight to this news. [  SOURCE ,  VIA ,  2  ]"
Cheryl Bates,Dynamic Duo: The OPPO PM-3 Headphones and HA-2 Amp Review,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/25/oppo-malaysia-pm3-headphone-ha-2-amp-review/,,,2015-09-25,"UPDATE : Both devices have had a minor price revision, the OPPO PM-3 now retails for RM 1,399 and the OPPO HA-2 at RM 1,699. It might seem a little odd seeing one of the Chinese smartphone brands that we know and love suddenly out some high end audioware, but believe it or not OPPO had its roots in audio way before they started producing phones. Here we have the OPPO PM-3 Planar Magnetic Headphones, the cheapest option of their high end series of headphones alongside their headphone amplifier-slash-battery pack the OPPO HA-2. In case you’re not sure what a “Planar Magnetic Driver” is, it’s basically a sound driver that generates sound via a thin diaphragm using a magnetic system. It’s generally pretty stable and produces minimal distortion. Its same kind of driver that resides on OPPO’s PM-1 headphones that features a FEM-optimized neodymium magnet system as well as seven-layer double side voice coil diaphragm to make it lightweight but still maintains sound quality. The drive also comes in at a rather large 55mm diameter which OPPO claims is tuned to deep, tight bass with a smooth sound signature. That essentially means you’re going to be getting some really good sound reproduction."

With about 2 days to go, the purported presentation slides for the Nexus 6P have surfaced online, revealing almost everything you need to know about the latest phablet.  Firstly, the new Nexus 6P is the first Nexus flagship to feature an all metal build. Instead of a 6 incher (5.96″) like the current Motorola based Nexus 6, the new 6P that’s made by Huawei is going for a slightly smaller 5.7″ display. It pushes a Quad HD resolution that’s protected by Gorilla Glass 4. Accompanying the display is a pair of front ported speakers similar to its predecessor.  Under the metal body, the Nexus 6P runs on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor that’s found on most flagships today. There’s no mention of RAM but it comes with a variety of storage sizes – 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. As usual, there’s no expandable storage via microSD. For the first time on a Nexus, it will get USB Type-C which supports both faster data transfer and Quick Charge. At the back, there’s also a fingerprint scanner, that lets you unlock or skip passwords at a single touch. For imaging, the deck didn’t reveal exact pixel count numbers but its “Nexus Camera” is said to have been improved for better low light shots. Paired with its Google camera app, it promises quicker capture while keeping your subject in focus.  We have a hunch that this could be a Sony IMX230 21MP sensor with Phase Detection AF like the honor 7 . UPDATE : According to  Android Police  which has gotten a couple of more slides, the camera is confirmed to be a 12.3MP f/2.0 unit that comes with a larger 1.55 μM pixel size which allows more light. Meanwhile at the front, it is expected to carry a 8MP camera that has a standard 1.4 μM pixel size.  With a 3,450mAh capacity battery, the Nexus 6P weighs 178 grams. That’s quite remarkable as it is 230mAh more than the current Nexus 6 but it is still lighter by 6 grams. The biggest change in terms of experience is definitely Android M as it comes with a couple of tweaks on app management, power efficiency and native support for more features including a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C.  UPDATE : The Nexus 6P  could be priced   at US$499.99 (about RM2,215) for the 32GB storage option. It will be available in 4 colours – Aluminium, Graphite, Frost and Gold, with the last colour surprisingly exclusive initially for Japan. The Nexus 6P and its smaller Nexus 5X will be launched on 29th September at 11:00PM (Malaysian Time). You can check out all the slides in the source link below. [  SOURCE   2  ]"

In the video, the guys dropped the two devices at three different angles – front first, back first and sideways. Overall the new 7000 series aluminium held up quite well, merely scuffing when dropped in the last two orientations. The face first drop on the other hand caused the screens to crack – no surprise here, glass is still glass. We hope no one else actually does this for fun, or rather takes a videos of it; mainly cause the sound of the device hitting the ground is just painful to experience – over and over again. Has Apple addressed durability concerns? or will you be getting the new iPhones? Let us know your answers, as well as how far you’ve travelled to get to be an early adopter of any tech device in the comments below. [  SOURCE  ]"

Rolling on those releases, the unannounced Lenovo device (possibly camouflaged to actually be the Vibe X3), has shown itself in certification associations in Malaysia and China. There’s still some uncertainty surrounding the whole matter though, as the supposed successor to the Vibe X2 had already been  seen  on TENNA’s site; only carrying a different spec sheet and additional “Vibe” branding on the back. Luckily the newest report has some backing –  benchmarked  carrying a 5.5-inch Full HD screen (1920 x 1080), a six-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 and 3GB of RAM. It’ll also have 64GB of internal memory (no mention of expandability), a 21-megapixel camera and finger-print sensor combo on the back, while upfront it receives an 8-megapixel snapper. Overall, it is quite a huge step up from its former  Vibe X2 . Cellular connections will be managed by a dual-SIM LTE enabled slot, while the device runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and is powered by a huge 3,500 mAh battery; fitting, as Lenovo has a knack for putting large batteries in their devices. Since Lenovo’s acquisition of Motorola and the announcement that they plan to  dissolve  their Mobile division to sell under the Motorola name, their design language has shifted – as you can tell from the photos, the speaker grills and less aggressive curves tell the tale. The same device has already been spotted in the wild, at a 2015 Chinese Telecommunications Expo, no less; so it definitely exists, but no confirmations of specs are to be seen. When will we see it being released and what specs will it carry? Your guess is as good as ours, but it’ll be soon enough, if the certification appearances are anything to lead on. We’ll be sure to keep everyone updated as we know more. A big thank you to  @KevinNgTK  for the SIRIM tip. [  SOURCE  ]"

Most mainstream players have announced their flagships for the 2nd half of this year, which includes the Galaxy Note5, Sony Xperia Z5 and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. If you are expecting HTC to come out with a new flagship to close the gap, you could be in for a disappointment.  The new HTC Aero was initially  rumoured  to run on MediaTek’s top of the line Helio X20 processor that comes with 10 cores. However based on the recent information from @evleaks, the new HTC One A9 is likely to be a premium mid-ranger instead, which is more of a direct competitor to the  Galaxy A8  and the  OPPO R7  series. Even the model name  One A9  seems to be poking fun at Samsung’s Galaxy A series.  Instead, it gets a more mainstream 5″ Full HD display, a Snapdragon 617 processor that’s mated with just 2GB of RAM and has 16GB of storage on board. For imaging, it has a 13MP main camera with OIS while the front retains HTC’s 4MP Ultra-pixel camera. The Aero is meant to be a fashion centric device with a slender unibody metal design at 7mm thick. As usual, HTC is rumoured to pack a smaller battery with just 2,150mAh capacity. As seen in the new pic above, there’s a fingerprint scanner at the front but surprisingly it is missing a speaker grill at the bottom.  Just a few hours ago, @evleaks has also shared the 6 colour options available, which looks like a collection of iPod Touches. In summary, this isn’t going to replace its current One M9 but instead it is a possible successor of the former  HTC One S . The new HTC One A9 is expected to be released in November and hopefully this could be priced competitively to attract the masses.  [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"
Alexander Wong,You can buy the iPhone 6s in Malaysia and here’s how much it’ll cost you,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/26/buy-iphone-6s-malaysia-latest-pricing/,"AP Set,apple,Buy iPhone 6S,DirectD,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6S Malaysia Price,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia Price,iPhone 6S Plus Price,iPhone 6S Plus Pricing,iPhone 6S Price,iPhone 6S Pricing,Lazada,SatuGadgetDotCom","Apple,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-26,"UPDATE : The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus  comes to Malaysia  officially on 16th October.  The  iPhone 6s  and its bigger  iPhone 6s Plus  went on sale  since yesterday  in first wave countries which includes Singapore. For us in Malaysia, it would probably take months before it gets here officially and that’s despite the latest Apple duo making an appearance in our  SIRIM database  .  If you can’t wait, our enterprising retailers are always there to fulfill the need of those who want the latest. Most of these units are likely to be from Singapore due to proximity and  more favourable prices , based on our current exchange rates.  Want to buy the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus? We compared the current deals offered by  DirectD ,  SatuGadget  and  Lazada Malaysia  for your easy reference. Check them out after the break.  
 Getting an iPhone in Singapore is quite expensive to start with, no thanks to our current 1 SGD = RM3.08 exchange rate. Being an import or AP set, there’s an obvious premium to pay on top of the original price.  The cheapest iPhone 6s with 16GB can be yours starting from RM3,559 on  SatuGadget  but this is limited to the more classic Silver and Space Grey colours. Meanwhile, the phablet sized iPhone 6s Plus starts from RM4,699 for 16GB from both SatuGadget and Lazada.  Across the board, the gold colours would cost more due to anticipated higher demand and it is more extravagant for the new pinkish Rose Gold. If you do plan on shooting lots of 4K videos, it is advisable to  give the 16GB model a pass  and go for at least 64GB.  If money is no object to you, the iPhone 6s Plus with 128GB storage is sold starting at RM5,945 on Lazada and it goes up to RM7,288 for the Rose Gold colour option. That’s seriously a lot of money to pay and history has always proven that there are always people willing to spend that insane amount.  UPDATE : The iPhone 6s/6s Plus will be  launched in Malaysia officially  on 16th October. Better to wait for the official sets which are also available on contract from our telcos.  UPDATE 2 (29/9/2015) : Some sellers have started throwing price with the iPhone 6s 16GB  going for as low as  RM3,199 on Lazada. That’s below the market price since it is priced at S$1,048 in Singapore, which is about RM3,282.  For a more sensible purchase, you can probably wait until sometime in  November  when it is expected to launch officially in Malaysia. Looking at Apple’s constant  price hike in Malaysia , do expect to pay more compared to previous years. The prices above are correct at time of writing and they are subject to change without prior notice.  You can check out the iPhone 6s/6s Plus listings in the links below:

Codenamed internally as the “Venice”, serial leakster @evleaks has  revealed  BlackBerry Priv as the official commercial name.  The name “Priv” sounds more edgier than the current models that sounded more regular like the Passport, Classic and Leap. Probably sounds fitting since this is BlackBerry’s first diversion into a competing OS. After all it has been a while since BlackBerry makes a QWERTY slider device like the  BlackBerry Torch .  To recap on the specs, the BlackBerry Priv is said to be running on a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. The front display is a 5.4″ unit that’s expected to push a Quad HD resolution. The back camera is a 18MP unit with dual-LED flash while selfies are handled by its front 5MP shooter.  Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop but it gets BlackBerry’s own proprietary apps including BlackBerry Hub. Based on earlier rumours, this should be launched sometime in November and hopefully it arrives in Malaysia in time for Christmas.

The  Nexus 6P  is a 5.7″ phablet made by Huawei while the smaller Nexus 5X is an upgrade of the former  Nexus 5  that’s made by LG.  Ahead of the official event, the spec sheet of the Nexus 5X has been revealed and it is definitely a mid-ranger compared to its bigger Nexus 6P sibling. Head after the break for the full list. For starters, the front gets a 5.2″ display that pushes a Full HD resolution with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. That’s slightly bigger than the Nexus 5 and the size should be perfect for single handed use. Powering the Nexus 5X is a 2.0GHz Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor which is pretty decent but it is mated to only 2GB LPDDR3 RAM. For storage, it comes only in 16GB or 32GB storage options without expandable microSD.  In the imaging department, the main camera is a 12.3MP f/2.0 shooter with a larger 1.55 μM pixel size and it comes assisted with IR laser auto focus and dual LED flash. For the front, it gets a 5MP f/2.2 camera with a standard 1.4 μM pixel size. Interestingly, the cameras are similar to what was  rumoured  for the Nexus 6P.  As supported natively with the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Nexus 5X also comes with a rear mounted fingerprint scanner and it uses the future proof USB Type C connector port. There’s no mention of the battery size but the feature list promises all day battery life. We can only hope that LG can do better this time round as the previous Nexus 5 battery comes with just 2,300mAh capacity.  With Android M, users can expect  improved battery life  as demonstrated on the Nexus 5. With such specs, this should be geared towards value conscious customers compared to its top end Nexus 6P. According to  Android Police , the Nexus 5X is priced from US$379.99 for the 16GB version, which is about RM1,687 with the current US$1=RM4.44 exchange rate. Meanwhile the Nexus 6P with 32GB storage  could carry  a US$499.99 (about RM2,215) price tag. What do you guys think? [  SOURCE  ]"

From the leaks so far, it would be coming with a rear mounted fingerprint scanner and a possible 13MP/16MP camera that’s assisted with Laser Auto Focus. With  Android M  supporting USB Type C with fast charge, it is safe to assume that the Nexus 5X will come with it as well. The Nexus 6P is their phablet option and it is the first Nexus device that’s coming from Huawei. The alleged specs so far points to a 5.7″ Quad HD display, Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor with storage options that goes up to 128GB.

This is their current flagship offering that comes in a compact 5″ size surrounded with a premium feeling stainless steel frame. Priced at RM999, it sounds quite affordable by flagship standards.  The front display is a 5 inch IPS panel that does Full HD resolution, giving a pixel density of 441ppi. With glass on both front and back, it is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3 for better resistance to scuffs. Under the hood, it uses a 64-bit 1.3GHz Octa-Core MediaTek MT6753 processor that’s also powering the  Meizu M2 Note . In terms of RAM and storage, it gets 3GB and 32GB respectively which is expandable with microSD up to 64GB. Like most dual-SIM devices, the microSD slot is shared with its 2nd sim slot.  Being a flagship, it also gets a front mounted 2nd gen fingerprint scanner which claims to unlock at just 0.5 seconds. To protect it from scratches, the scanner has a sapphire glass surface with a stainless steel ring around it. On the right side, you’ll find the standard power button and volume rockers. In addition, there’s a dedicated “camera button” that doubles up as a customisable multi-functional key. For taking pictures, the Elite 1 packs a rather high 16MP f/2.0 Sony shooter at the back with dual-LED flash. The front meanwhile has a high resolution 13MP f/2.4 camera and it even comes with a flash for better low light selfies. Keeping the lights on is a rather small 2,400mAh capacity battery and overall it weighs 136 grams with a thickness of 7.5mm.

The LEAGOO Elite 1 is available at their authorised stores nationwide starting 25th September and it comes in 3 colours – Mysterious Black, Pure White and Glistering Gold.

Codenamed “Envoy” the new band could feature a more refined design, allowing the display to be viewed in different angles, and not just under your wrist anymore. On the surface, the images seem to confirm the notions of earlier reports by the group at Windows Central; mentioning the curved display and possibility of expanding the device’s availability to include more countries. Microsoft’s second generation wearable handles the problem of ergonomics and viewing angles that were faced by its predecessor. The tech giant has also moved the battery from the sides to underneath the coloured display. It’ll also include an altimeter; if we understood what Microsoft Insider reported as sensor to measure the “height of an exercise”. Accented with what looks like metal on its side, the Band 2 will supposedly include an optical heart sensor, accelerometer/gyrometer, GPS tracking, a microphone, ambient light sensor, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and UV sensor. Being the City That Never Sleeps, NYC will host the Microsoft event on the 6 th  of October – rounding off a busy few weeks that’s already seen the city host Apple and soon to go ahead with LG as well.

The older report was thanks to an image posted by Evan Blass aka  @evleaks  and rightly put, the newer image is as well. Considering the brand has been hit hard even in Korea, it’s assumed that adding devices to their existing inventory could boost sales; especially since they have yet to refresh the LG G Pro 2 that was released early last year. Touted as the aforementioned phablet’s successor, the LG V10 is seen to be the maker’s answer to their domestic rivals, Samsung – a move that saw the LG G Pro 2 rival the then Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Much alike their rivals with their styluses, LG seeks to add their own twist to the mobile device world (while still copying some cues from who else,  Samsung ) by adding this “ticker display”. A similar rendition of  Samsung’s Galaxy Note Edge , that allows users to have a continuous info-stream on the smaller display, while the device’s main display is off. But for a better viewing experience, the LG V10’s ticker display is horizontal, so no need to turn your head or the device in horizontal orientation to view notifications – assuming that it offers the same features as the Note Edge. When looks are considered, it pretty much takes a lot after the  LG G4 , more so due to the lower front being empty, as the button placements are all on the back. A backing which seems to have a textured finish, based on photos. That aside, it’ll sport a 5.7-inch main display that pushes QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution, while the secondary smaller notification-like display has no mention of its pixels. In terms of it’s processor, the V10 is rumoured to carry the tried and true 6 cored Snapdragon 808 processor; aimed to play it safe and forgo issues with the Qualcomm 810’s overheating. It will have 3GB of RAM and a standard 64GB of internal memory; no mention of a microSD slot, unfortunately. Camera optics however stand at a supposed 16-megapixels for the rear camera, together with laser auto-focus and dual-LED flash but the front is where it takes an expected turn. From the image provided, it looks like LG’s V10 will have some form of dual-front facing cameras – then again these are leaks so lets not dwell much further. It could simply just be an LED flash but there is information stating that the front camera will be a 5-megapixel sensor. Rounding off, the home button might have been redesigned to house a finger-print sensor but we’re just speculating off  TENAA’s earlier report.  For now that’s pretty much all there is about this new LG device but with October the 1 st  not long away, the New York announcement should answer all our questions about this phablet. [  SOURCE  ]"

Coming in either Volcanic Grey or Mica White colour options, the Flash 2 also comes with Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box and supports dual-SIM LTE slots for those who have two cellular lines. Rounding it off, the device will be powered by a 3,000 mAh battery that they’ve promised will last you through the day. Alcatel OneTouch has held back pricing for now but we’re likely to hear a follow-up announcement from them once they release the device in the Malaysian market. Head on over  here  to find out more about the device."
Arif Lee,Celcom launches Zipit Chat – an encrypted communications app,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/23/celcom-launches-zipit-chat-an-encrypted-communications-app/,"AES 256 encryption,Axiata,Celcom,Celcom Axiata,Zipit Chat,Zipit Chat Celcom","Android,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-23,"Celcom today announced its newest app that promises to provides a secure, worry free experience that utilises Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) 256 technology; a globally recognised encryption system to secure your information. We’ve all heard of  WhatsApp  having massive security flaws, causing malicious affects on user data and devices. The same goes for  WeChat  on iOS that was recently afflicted with the XcodeGhost code in its app – so the question remains, what alternatives do we have? Coincidences are great, especially when they work in your favour, thus, Celcom wants to provide you a way “to maintain fullest control of privacy for” your chats and messages with Zipit Chat. The app seeks to implement the aforementioned encryption to secure your chats, emails, voice over IP (VoIP) and files that you’ll transfer to others. Other than the encryption, it’ll also protect your passwords by allowing the app to reset your device and disable the screen capture option on other devices. Zipit Chat also gives you control over your media and phone book, by switching to private mode, while the same function can offer users to make their messages self-destruct. Users can pick if they want their conversations to remain “invisible” by putting conversations in stealth mode – by masking the user’s ID. Chats on a one-to-one basis are encrypted by default, and only the two people in the conversation can view the messages through a provided unique decryption key. The same goes for group chats, offering the same mutual unique key for opening content. Emails too are protected and even the major email providers below are supported: Zipit Chat can be purchased for RM 10/month on the  Google Play store  for Android with Celcom  looking to launching the iOS version next month onwards. Though, for a limited time the service will be free to use until the 22th of November 2015, so while it lasts do check it out (take note of the T&Cs) Check out how to set up the app  here , if you’re interested in subscribing to Celcom’s new offering."
Alexander Wong,The Pebble Time Goes Round. The thinnest and lightest round smart watch you can buy,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/24/the-pebble-time-goes-round-the-thinnest-and-lightest-round-smart-watch-you-can-buy/,"Pebble,Pebble Smart Watch,Pebble Time,Pebble Time Round,Pebble Time Round order,Round Smart Watch,Smart Watch","Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2015-09-24,"Not too long after releasing its  Pebble Time  series, Pebble has just introduced its new Pebble Time Round. Moving away from the typical square and toyish design, the new Pebble looks like a traditional watch with a variety of colours and bands to match. Furthermore, it is the lightest and thinnest smart watch yet weighing from just 28 grams with a thickness of 7.5mm.  Like the new mainstream smart watches, the Pebble Time Round comes in 2 strap sizes, a 14mm size for the ladies and a broader 20mm version for men. It is slightly narrower than the typical 22mm size on the previous Pebbles and the bands are easy to swap with its quick change mechanism. For now, it comes with just leather bands and the metal versions would be made available later. In total there are 3 options (Silver, Rose Gold, Black) available for the 14mm Pebble Time Round and just 2 (Black and Silver) for the larger 20mm version. In terms of design, it looks pretty sleek with its marine grade stainless steel body and the watch display is an always-on colour E-Paper unit, just like the Pebble Time. It has the same buttons with a back button on the left and the typical 3 navigation buttons on the right, so usability hasn’t changed if you’re using the current Pebble Time. It still gets a built-in microphone that’s used for voice commands. When compared to other smart watches, you’ll notice a much thicker bezel but Pebble somewhat has managed to mask it with a variety of patterns from circular lines to numeric markers for the hour and minutes.  The biggest sacrifice of going round and thin would be its battery life. Instead of the usual 7 to 10 days of use, the Pebble Time Round is rated to last just up to 2 days on a single charge. According to Pebble this is a worthy trade off for style and the new Time Round also supports quick charge, giving 24 hours of use with a quick 15 minutes charge. So a full charge for 2 days use in theory can be done in just 30 minutes, which is heaps faster than the Apple Watch. Charging is still done with its magnetic USB charger that snaps onto the back of the watch.  Another trade off for the Pebble Time Round is it isn’t as water resistant as before. On the previous Pebbles including the Time Steel, it can be submerged under 30 metres of water with its 5 ATM rating. The Pebble Time Round however is only splash resistant even with its IPX7 rating. The product page has explicitly mentioned: “Pebble Time Round is splash resistant but not waterproof. Incidental exposure to water–like unforeseeable rain–won’t ruin your device, but submerging the watch is not recommended.” No doubt the Pebble Time is more basic in “smart features” as compared to the Moto 360, Samsung Gear S2, Huawei Watch and LG Urbane. For Pebble, it isn’t about cramming the most tech but the main focus is on building a functional watch that tells the time 24/7 without sleep with the capabilities of notifications and apps. It is a pretty looking thing but we expected them to at least maintain the impressive 7 days of battery life. The good thing about Pebble is that it supports both Android and iOS devices, giving it a wider compatibility than other smart watches out there.  If you’re interested, it is available for  pre-orders now  at US$249.99 (RM1,095) with shipping to start sometime in November. Want something simpler? The original Pebble Classic is  now going  for US$99 (RM438).  [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"
Alexander Wong,Meizu PRO 5 official unveiled. A premium flagship that could take on the Note5,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/23/meizu-pro-5-official-unveiled-a-premium-flagship-that-could-take-on-the-note5/,"Android,FlymeOS,Meizu,Meizu Malaysia,Meizu PRO 5,Meizu Pro 5 Launch,MEIZU Pro 5 Malaysia","Android,Meizu,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-23,"Today Meizu has announced the PRO 5, a new premium flagship smart phone which has the means to take on the best Android smart phones available today. With Samsung  dominating benchmarks  with its own in house developed components, you won’t be surprised to see Meizu putting the best possible specs to raise the bar higher. At 5.7 inch, it has the same display size as the Galaxy Note5 and home ground rival Mi Note. Instead of having a Quad HD display, Meizu is settling for a more traditional Full HD AMOLED display that comes encased under a 2.5D glass. Design wise, it retains the same unibody metal design as the past flagships like the  MX4 Pro  and the  MX5 . At the front, it has a home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. The new generation fingerprint scanner is said to be quicker with 0.5 second response time when touched in any direction.  The hardware underneath is where it gets a little interesting. It runs on the same Exynos 7420 processor as the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note5 that’s mated to either 3GB or 4GB of DDR4 RAM. On top of that, it also utilises Samsung’s  Universal Flash Storage  (UFS 2.0) which is faster and more efficient compared to typical eMMC 5.0 storage.  With its own optimisation, the Meizu PRO 5 smashes the Galaxy S6 in Antutu benchmarks scoring over 77,000 points. There are 2 variants available, with the 3GB RAM paired with 32GB of storage, while the higher 4GB RAM variant gets 64GB of storage.  In the imaging department, the back gets Sony’s new IMX230 21MP camera with Phase Detection AF, Laser Auto Focus assistance and dual-LED flash. Meanwhile the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter that comes with its own beautification features. For sound, the PRO 5 boasts Hi-Fi quality audio with its additional ES9018K2M DAC and OPA1612 OP Amp.  Keeping the lights on, the Meizu PRO 5 is juiced up by a 3,050mAh capacity battery which comes with its mCharge 2.0 feature. With a faster 24W fast charger, it can charge up from 0-65% in just 30 minutes. That’s faster than Samsung but it is still a notch below OPPO’s VOOC Flash Charger that does 0-75% in the same duration. Meizu has also ditched the old school microUSB port for a reversible USB Type C that’s currently used on the latest MacBook, OnePlus 2, Nokia N1 and the recently announced Xiaomi Mi 4c.    In terms of connectivity, it supports dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and the 2nd slot accepts microSD with expandable storage up to 128GB extra. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 but with a heavily skinned FlymeOS 5.0 running on top.  The Meizu PRO 5 is priced at 2,799CNY (about RM1,908) for the 32GB version while its bigger 64GB model is priced at 3,099CNY (about RM2,112). That’s quite a huge step up from its previous flagships, encroaching the price range of its mainstream rivals. Nevertheless, it is still quite an interesting alternative considering it packs the same high performance hardware as the Galaxy S6. For more info, you can check out the  Meizu PRO 5  product page."

The  ZTE Axon  is coming to Malaysia and it aims to compete with the rest of the big boys in the high-end Android smart phone segment.  There are two models available, the ZTE Axon Pro and the ZTE Axon Elite. The Axon Pro is their highest offering with a 5.5″ Quad HD display and it comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB to 128GB of on-board storage. Meanwhile the ZTE Axon Elite is a notch down with a 5.5″ Full HD display, 3GB RAM and has 32GB of storage. Both comes with a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB for your extra storage needs. For the Malaysian market, we would getting the lower spec Axon Elite.  The rest of the hardware are identical with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor that’s clocked at 2.0GHz. For taking pictures, it features a dual 13MP+2MP rear camera assisted with dual-LED flash. Selfies meanwhile are handled by its front facing 8MP camera that shoots with a wide 84 degree angle.  The feature list doesn’t end there either, as it comes with a biometric fingerprint scanner, voice control and an iris scanner. Also included is a AKM4961 HiFi chip, NFC and dual-SIM slots supporting 4G LTE. Powering the device is a 3,000mAh battery which can be juiced up faster with QuickCharge 2.0.

Locally we have recently spotted a  grey importer selling  the ZTE Axon Pro at RM3,499 (128GB storage version) and the Axon Elite (32GB storage) at RM2,550. Officially, the ZTE Axon Pro is  sold  at US$449.98 (RM1,935) in the US and we expect the Axon Elite to be offered less than that in Malaysia. The ZTE Axon Malaysian launch is happening next Monday, 28th September so stay tuned for the latest updates."

During this period of time, you can openly access messaging and chat platforms, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube without a cap. This however isn’t too far off from what is being offered by  Hotlink ,   U Mobile  and   Digi  who has the same 1AM to 7AM time slot  YouTube  streaming. To get the benefit of free late night surfing, all one needs to do is subscribe to either XPAX’s weekly or monthly internet plans which starts from RM 10. The five plan options are as follows, Net10 gets you 500MB data for RM 10, Net25 gets you 1GB data for RM 25, Net38 for 2GB data for RM 38 and lastly Net58 for 4GB data with a RM58 subscription fee. Take note all the data being offered is high-speed 4G LTE, and that the RM 5 daily plan isn’t eligible for the late night free internet benefits. All monthly plans will also grant you 75 minutes of free talktime and 75 free SMS, while the Weekly plan will give 15 mins/15SMS and the daily plan only grants 3 mins/3 SMS. After this, you will be charged 2.5 sen/min for your calls with a new call rate of 30 sen per block of 12 minutes talk time. There apparently is also fair usage policy in regards to the data but Celcom claims that the limit is “big enough to literally surf unlimited”. This is on top of their 500MB free basic internet per month which you get as long as your subscription is active. You can check out the plans below, as detailed by  their website. Also, for this month only Magic SIM customers can give another Magic SIM to another member of family or friends as part of a promotion with the Internet Burung Hantu launch."

Though, the iOS App Store, has relatively been safe, recently Chinese developers have inadvertently implanted a spoofed version of the Xcode software that’s used by Apple on some of their apps. The XcodeGhost file was uploaded on Baidu, a site that serves as a file sharing platform; unaware of this, some Chinese developers accidentally used the malware-embedded code for their apps, hence the malicious code making its way on to the App Store. So how dangerous is this code? Well what it sets out to do is to collect user information on their devices and send them out to their servers. The information it collects include: Why would they need information like that? To put it shortly, the code needs it so it can fake alerts to trick you to reveal personal data or read and change any information on your copy clipboards – including password management apps. It’ll pose an indefinite risk to those who use WeChat, as a lot of information gets swapped around on the instant messaging app. Just be sure to remove the apps mentioned below, but in terms of fixes the developers of WeChat have updated it from the affected 6.2.5 to the current (unaffected) version 6.2.6; an update that removed the malicious code. As a precaution, we suggest you remove WeChat and then install the newest version – just be sure to backup your chat logs first. You can do so by following these steps: After being informed, Apple has since removed apps that were infected, though users who’ve installed them before, still have to delete the infected apps on their devices. While most of the 77 apps are mainly used by people living in China, there are still some apps that are widely used by users around the world.

Speculated  to be a phablet, replacing the LG G Pro 2, today’s launch confirms that LG might still have another device up its sleeve (excluding the  V10  that’s supposed to be on October the 1 st ). The Korean phone maker is changing it up this time around, as their latest device is more metal than ever before, carved out of a single block of metal, this unibody device carries a 5-inch (1280 x 720) display. A let down to many that in this generation feel that screens should at least be 1080p but moving along, it’s designed with 2.5D curved glass – easing ergonomics for those concerned but being a 5-inch device, it should be a non-issue. Other internals include 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage (expandable). The mid-ranger will be equip with 4G LTE, NFC but only have a 2,050 mAh battery on board; fueling reasons to why they may have chosen the lowly Quad-core Snapdragon 410 chip, that clocks at only 1.2GHz. The device weighs in at 147grams and runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. So far the LG Class has been classified as a domestic-only product but if you’re still interested it retails at KRW 399,300 aka RM 1,451 (at that price, you’ll be able to purchase the ASUS Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus 2, if you can get an invite). That said, we’re not sure what direction LG is going for but if they manage to price this lower and team up with Korean telcos well enough, they just may see some market demand. Do tell us what you think about LG’s new device, does it compete well at its price-range? Would you buy it? Do you like the direction LG’s design team is heading towards (with more metal and less polycarbonate)? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

We spent sometime with the device and can vouch for it’s one-hand mode, that shrinks the screen to enable users to reach in places they couldn’t in full-screen. This humongous device runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, together with 2GB of RAM. Storage options will leave users with 32GB of internal memory, while you’ll get a microSD slot to calm your memory capacity woes – utilises the only nano-SIM tray of the micro + nano hybrid tray.

The aforementioned camera shares a horizontal line with the Dolby Atmos audio speakers, which we’ve yet to fully experience (we’ll update on how it sounds when we can). On the front however, a 5-megapixel front facing camera is housed on the right of the speaker grill. Below that is a 6.8-inch IPS display that pushes a Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution.

Xiaomi has been taught lessons based on its experiences and have listened to consumers, providing a choice of either a 16GB or 32GB option for the Mi 4c. Marketed to be a young and hip device, it’ll be available in the same array of colours as its predecessor – white, black, baby blue, yellow and pink.

Still, if you’re one of the lucky few to have the OnePlus 2, the 2.1 update brings some new much awaited features. The two big highlights are its new manual camera mode and RAW support for third party apps. For the manual mode, it adds some great extensive features, such as manual focus, shutter speed up to 30 seconds, ISO settings and exposure levels. Their home-grown developers have also added a slider to adjust the colour balance of the display (cooler or warmer) of your 2016 Flagship Killer; you can find these settings in the Display menu.

On the Zerolution program, the device is going from as low as RM59/month across 24 months with 0% interest and no upfront payment required. The only prerequisite is that you’ll need to sign up with its MaxisOne Plan that starts from RM98/month. Alternatively, you can get the OnePlus 2 the old fashion way with 24 months contract on the MaxisONE Plan. The bundled pricing are as follows As comparison, the option without Zerolution offers more subsidy if you’re committing to its higher plan. At RM59/month on Zerolution, without any extra upgrade or insurance options, this comes out to RM1,416 in total for the phone. The biggest difference for not taking up Zerolution is that you’ll need to fork out an advance payment and there’s a penalty should you end your contract before the 24 months period is up.

Arif Lee,Malaysia finally gets the honor 7 on its shores,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/21/malaysia-finally-gets-the-honor-7-on-its-shores/,"Honor,Honor 7,honor 7 launch,Honor 7 Malaysia,honor 7 malaysia price,Honor Malaysia,huawei,Huawei Honor 7,VMall","Android,huawei,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-21,"UPDATE : The honor 7  goes on sale  on 28th Sept at 10:08AM. A quick flashback to early September saw the honor Malaysia’s  Facebook page  announce that they had finally set the date for their most premium honor yet. Prior to the post, we flew off to London to take a first-hand look at the  honor 7  that we felt delivered on its part, quite well – considering its beefy specs and its price-point. Locally, it’s sad to note that we’ll be receiving only the 16GB version, while back home (China) the brand packs an additional 64GB option giving users more storage space. Not such a huge issue, if you make use of the microSD slot that lets you expand that memory by an additional 128GB. We’ve mentioned that the device is sleak and it brings a whole new premium feel to the honor lineup, as it is fashioned out of a single unibody of metal (for the most part). To reintroduce you to the  honor 7 , it has a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) plastered up front, utilising an IPS-Neo technology display. That plus, a beastly 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor, mated with 3GB of RAM – surely to give you ample amounts of processing power for day to day usage. Its images will be taken care of by a 20-megapixel lens with an aperture of f/2.0 on the back, while your front facing photos are captured by an 8-megapixel shutter equip with soft flash. We did a camera comparison  here , so check it out to see how the honor 7 stacked up to other flagships. The smartphone is powered by a 3,100 mAh battery that will take you from 0-50% in only 30 minutes with its optional fast charger. On the back together with its rear camera, you’ll notice a squarish finger-print sensor, which will enable you to simplify the device’s security through biometric recognition. Adding to its extensive features, users can also call out their new honor 7’s with its voice recognition software ready to assist you through commands like: A great package that scales at 157 grams, 8.5mm thick and runs a home-grown OS in the form of EMUI 3.1 on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop. It even has dual-SIM (nano) LTE capabilities, for its affordable price range but as always, you’ll sacrifice one SIM slot for the microSD card. In the past, all honor devices have been exclusively sold online, so this time should be no different. If you want to pick up one yourself, you can register your interest at the  vmall website  (1pm onwards), to entitle you for the pre-order – actual sales begin on the 28th of September, in conjunction with Mycybersale. Priced at RM 1,399 (w/ GST), you’ll get to choose from two colour options, Mystery Grey or Fantasy Silver. Taking into account of the pricing, we still feel it’s decent, albeit not having NFC. Huawei has even thrown in some freebies like a free RM 50 voucher and 6 months of screen replacement; best of all for the first 1000 to register for the pre-order will receive a free 32GB microSD card to slot into their devices.

With the introduction of  iPhone 6/6 Plus , he shared that more people are making the switch from the Android smart phones. Based on this trend, they had introduced a “ Move to iOS ” app on the Google Play Store to make the transition even smoother. That should keep everybody happy right? Unfortunately things doesn’t seem to go well as planned.   Like the name suggests, the Move to iOS app is designed to make switching from Android to an iPhone easier. It allows you to transfer existing photos, messages, contacts, calendars and more over WiFi. With Android die hard fans seeing this as a blasphemous act, they had raged a “Review” war by downloading the app and then leaving some deliberately poor ratings along with some interesting remarks.  Some of the comments are hilarious with one claiming that he is turning into a sheep and another reporting the app is fake as it turned his LG G3 into a BlackBerry curve. There are those that are demanding Google to remove such app as Apple themselves would not allow such app to exist on their own App Store. There’s an iOS app guideline that prohibits any mentions of other mobile platform. At time of writing, the “Move to iOS” app has gotten 14,330 reviews, 80% of them being ranked with just 1 star.

As usual, there will be loads of people trying to get their hands on one especially in mainland China.  With people willing to do almost anything to get the latest Apple product, a special kind of bank is offering an attractive way of owning iPhone 6s. Nope, you won’t even need to lose any of your  vital organs  to get it and it is easier than you think.  In a populous country with over a billion people, China surprisingly is in dire need to fill up 18 sperm banks around the country. Struggling to attract new donors, they have started a campaign that offers an easier way of obtaining an iPhone 6s. All they need to do is to make a donation at a sperm bank.  The Hubei Human Sperm Bank had sent out a message over WeChat that links to an article entitled “New ways to get an iPhone 6s”. Inside it explains that the bank is seeking donors aged 22 to 45, with each to receive 5,000 CNY (about RM3,321) in subsidies. This in return would make them a step closer of buying an iPhone 6s that’s priced at 5,288 CNY (about RM3,512). So far there’s no word of its reception but the intimate deal has managed to get quite a lot of attention recording over 400,000 reads.  You must be wondering why sperm donation is a concern in China considering they have strict population control. According to a research by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, the sperm fertility of Chinese males has been dropping by 1% each year since the 80s. With the mad desire for the latest iPhone, this is probably the safest and less excruciating route for those without cash to spare.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

As seen earlier, the Mi 4c gets a hardware upgrade with a  Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor , which should make up for the  performance shortfalls  of its international version. Apart from getting a faster processor, Xiaomi has also confirmed that it will use a future-proof USB Type-C connector. If you’re worried about cable issues, Xiaomi has also posted that there will be a little nifty accessory that lets you charge using existing micro USB cables. So far it isn’t clear it the microUSB to Type C adapter comes included in the box, but do expect this to be priced cheaply if sold separately.  The rest of the specs are pretty much the same as before with a 5″ Full HD display, 2GB of RAM and the option of 16GB or 32GB of storage. For cameras, it would be utilising a 13MP main sensor at the back while the front gets a 5MP shooter. Battery is said to be more than 3,000mAh which is likely to be of the same capacity as the Mi 4i.  Xiaomi’s Weibo page has been teasing its upcoming event with the title “the prince is coming”. Since this is a Chinese market device, we are not too sure if it will be sold outside mainland China. Perhaps it could come as an enhanced version of the Mi 4i which currently runs on a Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM. Hopefully the USB Type C connector port supports Fast Charge with faster data transfer rates. [  SOURCE  ]"

This is an indication that Apple is preparing to bring their latest smart phones into Malaysia. But the question is when exactly?  As certified under SIRIM, Malaysia will be getting the A1687 and A1688 models which covers a wide range of LTE bands in both FDD and TDD standards. Apart from the new iPhones, the latest  Apple TV  with its Bluetooth remote has been spotted with the model number A1625. Also getting the green light is the new  iPad mini 4  with  both  A1538 (WiFi) and A1550 (WiFi + Cellular) making an appearance. So far there’s no sign of the  iPad Pro  which is expected to hit the market globally in November. To refresh your memory, the iPhone 6s and its larger 6s Plus is the  biggest iPhone refresh  we’ve seen so far. While the exterior looks the same except for its new rose gold colour, the newer iPhone gets toughen with a better aluminium 7000 material while the screen gets 3D touch.  Under the hood, it runs a newer A9 chip and 2GB of RAM, which is  double the amount  of its predecessor. For taking pictures, it finally gets a bump to 12MP, which is the first camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. The front camera is now a 5MP shooter and you can use the Retina display for selfie illumination in low light situations. You can read more about it in our iPhone 6s  announcement post . In terms of iPhone 6s local availability, we probably need to wait for sometime in November like last year’s iPhone 6. Our southern neighbour Singapore has commenced its pre-orders last week with actual shipping to start next Friday. If you want to get one,  it will cost  at least RM3,200 for the 16GB in Singapore, no thanks to current exchange rates. The new iPhone 6s does shoot 4K videos and we strongly advise you  not to take the 16GB version  if you plan on recording videos a lot. As for the  Apple Watch , there’s still no news until today and if you want to get one, it is already available in both Thailand and Singapore.  iPhone 6s Malaysia SIRIM Certification

We suppose it’ll ease the burden of those having to find yourself an ASUS authorised retailer, though the phone maker has already caused quite a stir releasing as many smartphones as they can. For the selfie-centric  Zenfone Selfie , you’ll be able to choose between pink, (sky) blue, or white; while the  Zenfone 2 Laser , you’ll be able to get your hands only on a red or black option – soon gold, silver and white will be available too. One of the perks of purchasing online is you’ll be able to get it delivered to your doorstep for free in only 3 days. Just to recap some of the specs, the former has dual 13-megapixel sensors and dual-LED flash – giving it ample justification for its name. It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor that’s coupled together by 3GB of RAM and provides 32GB of internal memory (expandable). All your images and videos will be viewed on a 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen, which has Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on board to protect you from scratches and smudges. You’ll be connected to your cellular network through its Dual-SIM (LTE) slot, that will be powered by a 3000 mAh battery, that’s easily swappable. On to the latter more affordable option, the Zenfone 2 Laser sports a 5.5-inch HD 720p display and runs a 1.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 410 mated to 2GB of RAM, under its chasis. It’ll also have Gorilla Glass 4 to hinder any nicks on its screen but loses the dual 13-megapixel cameras, the Selfie has; instead it’ll have a 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, while the front will have a 5-megapixel shutter that’s equip with an aperture of f/2.0. Powering all this is a 3,000 mAh battery and since this is the more affordable option, it’ll only have a 3G enabled dual-SIM slot. Both devices run Android 5.0 out of the box but the Zenfone Selfie costs more at RM 1,049 (w/ GST) and the Zenfone 2 Laser will run you back RM 799 (w/ GST).

New reports by the people behind underkg seem to show the alleged “phablet” having a much smaller footprint. So what about the 5.7-inch phablet we saw in the Geekbench benchmarks? We’re not quite sure, it seems that there may be two devices out there that’s soon to be launched by LG (aside from the  V10  in October). Though, the photo also brings confirmation of the Class being built out of real metal, not those faux metal (plastic) shells finishes. It’s well possible that LG is trying out this all metal design to combat the brand’s lack of premium feeling phones, instead of opting for those (good quality) polycarbonate designs that has made their mobile brand what it is today. A bid to unseat Samsung’s ‘A’ series perhaps? All we can say is LG G4 didn’t perform to the company’s expectations so maybe a change of direction might be good for the smartphone maker. What else does this latest report confirm? Only the fact that the images show the branding of one of South Korea’s mobile telco carrier’s, and possible pricing in the aforementioned country – KRW 400,000, roughly translating to RM 1,457. Nonetheless, LG has a tendency to release phones only for its home-country, but if you could, would you buy this device? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Seen as a mid-range phablet, as far as specs show in the info section of its benchmarking, LG could look at this to be the successor to its 5.9-inch G Pro 2. Rumours have mentioned that the Korean company will name the H740 as the LG Class, and the company’s social media channels have been actively teasing an announcement on the aforementioned date. Although, the specs don’t really deserve a second glance, it’ll be fully constructed in metal, which could mean LG is changing its stance on its removable battery and plastic bodies for a more premium feel and look. Some things still remain as brand trademarks; seeing the button placements haven’t moved from the back but there seems to be a thin line that looks like a speaker grill, now nearing the top. The device in question will come with ample screen estate, being a phablet sized 5.7-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen and carry an assumed Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor. It’ll also come with 2GB of RAM and possibly 8GB of internal storage (we’re hopeful its expandable). The camera optics of this device could be either a 12 or 13-megapixel sensor on the rear, assisted by a 5-megapixel camera on the front. Seeing that it carries the 615 chipset, it should come with LTE capabilities and will run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. LG has already sent out invites for an event on October the 1 st , but that’s likely the  V10 , so it possibly means that they aren’t placing such an emphasis on their supposed phablet.

They will be having an event in New York City promising to share something interesting about Windows 10 devices. Without hinting on actual products, it is safe to assume that Microsoft would be unveiling its latest Surface Pro 4 as well as its new flagship Lumia 950/950 XL. They are quite a huge deal as Microsoft’s first devices with Windows 10 running fresh out of the box. The  Surface Pro 3  that’s proven to be a laptop power house in a tablet form factor has been around for more than a year now. Don’t expect a major change for its design and the overall form factor and ports are expected to be the same which is good news for those that have made significant investment in accessories like its docking station.  This time around, the new Surface Pro 4 could come in 2 sizes – a standard 12″ like the current model and a much larger 14″ version. It has been rumoured that Microsoft might be pushing a 4K display on the 14 incher, doubling the 2160×1440 resolution of its current Surface Pro 3.  Under the hood, you can expect Intel’s new 6th generation of Skylake processors and it will be available in multiple combinations of RAM and storage capacities to suit different needs. The new Surface Pro 4 is said to be more power efficient and it might be slightly thinner and lighter than the current model.  After releasing several entry to mid-range Lumia devices, Microsoft is finally announcing its new flagship smart phones that could be worth the wait. Initially rumoured as the Lumia 940/940XL, both models are likely to be announced as the 950/950XL next month with Windows 10 mobile making its debut. In terms of specs, both models will be the first Windows Mobile devices to push a Quad HD displays on a 5.2″ screen on the 950 and a larger 5.7″ with the 950 XL. Under the hood, the 950 is expected to get a 64-bit Snapdragon 808 while its bigger sibling is powered by a top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor unit.    Both models are expected to get 3GB of RAM, 32GB of on-board storage which is expandable via microSD. In terms of cameras, a higher resolution 20MP PureView camera will take centre stage at the back with a  triple-LED flash , while the front gets a 5MP shooter. Another first for Microsoft is the usage of  USB Type-C  for charging and data transfer.   The Lumia 950 is said to come with a 3,000mAh battery while the 950 XL gets a larger 3,300mAh unit, both of which supports Qi wireless charging.

Dubbed as the BlackBerry Venice, this opens up a new opportunity for BlackBerry to tap into the Android segment where a built-in QWERTY keyboard is non-existent.  The folks at Android Authority were lucky enough to get their hands on the Venice, giving us better views of the device and some details of its new software experience.   From their hands-on, the new slider device gets a stock Android looking interface that’s shown on a 5.4″ like display. It isn’t mentioned whether it has an actual curved display but it does have a slight “Galaxy S6 edge”-like appearance from the front.  Without straying too far from its BlackBerry roots, communication is still the main focus with direct shortcuts to email, BBM messages and texting. The typical recent app interface has a slight tweak, displaying your running apps in different sizes depending on your usage.  Over at the back, the camera is said to be an 18MP shooter and it comes accompanied with 2 LED flash. According to the source, this new flagship device is powered by a Snapdragon 808 processor that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. The Venice is targeted to launch sometime in November on the big 4 telcos in the US. If it is the same as the Passport, we shouldn’t wait too long for it to launch in Malaysia.  For Android users that does a lot of email for work, would you consider making a switch to this device? or would you prefer to have a better spec-ed Galaxy Note5 or S6 edge+ with its optional  Keyboard Cover ?

Going for a more unconventional route, leaked photos have surfaced showing the yet to be released Nexus 5 (2015) in a Mint colourway. The photo in question shows the smaller Nexus option in an angle where the polycarbonate back seems to present itself as a Mint hue. Then again this could just be a photo that had its white balance settings tweaked, so there’s no real confirmation; just to remind you, these are leaks, so take everything with a grain of salt. Along with this purported Mint colourway, it’ll join the existing (leaked) options in White and Black. That aside, no other news has surfaced to go along with this particular leak. Just to jog your memory, LG’s take on the Nexus is supposed to be a 5.2-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display, running a Hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor and built with 3GB of RAM. Based on the latest report, it’s camera capabilities will apparently come with a 12.3-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front camera. Though, in the  past  we’ve posted based on other sources that say its rear camera will be a 16-megapixel or 20.7-megapixel shutter instead As seen in the past, Google’s Nexus devices will be the first smart phones to run Android 6.0 Mashmallow and it’s likely LG’s Nexus will make an appearance on the rumoured revealing on the 29 th  of September.

A promising candidate to make an appearance is the HTC One A9 (Aero) – a device that for the past few weeks leading up, has leaked quite a bit. The main game changer for HTC latest device, could be the processor that runs it; an assumed Deca-core (10) Helio X20 MT6797 chipset. Created with a tri-cluster system, the chipset’s supposed stats has finally been seen successfully testing its capabilities on Geekbench; topping the former number one Exynos 7420 carrying Samsung Galaxy S6 (4,547) by 1,337 marks. Other rumoured details of the smartphone include a 2.5D curve edged screen, that pushes a QHD resolution and protected by Gorilla Glass 4. It’s also purported to have 4GB of RAM and house an f/1.9 aperture camera (welcomed news, seeing that HTC’s cameras has suffered as of late).

The SIM is called KartuAs 2 in 1 and it runs on U Mobile as an MVNO along with its parent company, Telkom Indonesia for its service in our neighbouring country.  Essentially this is a Prepaid SIM that holds both Malaysian and Indonesian mobile numbers. Its allows you to make affordable IDD calls to Indonesia and those in Indonesia can call you at local rates to your 2nd number. When you travel between Malaysia and Indonesia, there’s no roaming charges and you get to enjoy low rates like a local. This is like having the benefit of dual-SIM cards and all you’ll need is one card.  The KartuAs 2 in 1 SIM Pack is sold at RM10.60 (inclusive of 6% GST) and it comes preloaded with RM5 and Rp 2,000 credit for each respective numbers. Upon activation, you get 5 minutes of free IDD calls to Indonesiaas well.

Calls within Malaysia are charged at 10 sen/30 seconds, while calls to Telkomsel numbers in Indonesia are charged at 9 sen/30 seconds.

The 2GB RAM for the iPhone is the first upgrade since the iPhone 5 and this helps to keep more sessions in memory and less reloading of apps from scratch.

It was just an iPad mini 2 with TouchID and it comes available with a gold colour option. When the  iPad Pro  was announced yesterday, they managed to slit in the iPad mini 4 into the keynote without much fanfare.  So what’s new with the iPad mini 4? Surely it is better than the iPad mini 3 and it really is.  As usual, there’s nothing new with the design so it still retains the unmistakable iPad mini appearance with its unibody aluminium body. However Apple has made some significant changes on the overall dimensions. It is only 6.1mm thin, which is the same as the  iPad Air 2 , the thinnest for an iPad.  In addition, they have also made some weight reductions bringing it down from 331g previously for the WiFi version to just 298.8g. Likewise, the WiFi + 4G Cellular versions which used to weigh 340g on the iPad mini 3 is now just 304g.  The display is still the same 7.9″ incher but they have improved it with the same fully laminated display as the iPad Air 2 with additional anti reflective coating. In the camera department, it gets the same combo as the bigger iPads with an 8MP f/2.2 main camera which now brings Burst shots and Slow-mo onto an iPad mini. Meanwhile the front still gets the same 1.2MP unit. The most welcome change is the processor, where it gets a newer A8 chip but it is still a notch below the A8X chip that’s powering its top of the line iPad Air 2. Apple claims that the A8 is 1.3x faster in processing and 1.6x faster in graphics than the previous A7.  With  iOS 9  being released very soon, the new Split View feature allowing you to run 2 apps side by side was previously exclusive just to the iPad Air 2, (and now iPad Pro) likely due to processor requirement. The new upgraded processor allows the iPad mini 4 to use split view, so this is good news for multi-taskers that prefer to use a smaller iPad. In terms of connectivity, it supports faster 802.11ac WiFi as well as Bluetooth 4.2. The battery life remains unchanged with up to 10 hours of use in a single charge. You get to pick up the iPad mini 4 in 3 colours – Silver, Space Grey and Gold. So far no word on its Malaysian availability but it won’t be as affordable as before especially with the  recent price hike  due to currency fluctuations.

The waterproof capability of Sony Xperia flagships lets you to take them where no other smart phones have gone before. With its current highest IP68 ingress rating, on paper you shouldn’t have anything to fear as it could withstand being submerged under 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. With the release of the  Xperia Z5  series, it appears that Sony is taking a step back with its waterproof claims. This is quite unusual especially they have been pushing its “waterproof” claims as a killer unique feature Under its new  waterproof page , the have mentioned the following: This is quite surprising considering Sony has been promoting its use underwater including taking photos and videos in the swimming pool. At one point of time, they even introduced a series of apps designed for  underwater use . Perhaps Sony is trying to manage customers expectations since they won’t cover damages caused by water in their standard warranty.  To ensure its ready for a splash, all ports must be covered fully but there’s always a risk that some flaps are not covered properly or its protective rubber lining starts to fail after a long period of time. In short, you can use it underwater but it will be your own responsibility if it is damaged as a result.   Sony isn’t the only one having such policy. When the Galaxy S5 was announced with IP67 water and dust resistance, it was marketed as a splash resistant rather than a submersible device. The same goes with the Apple Watch with its  IPX7 rating  but they are against  any use under water . Will this deter you from getting a “waterproof” Sony Xperia device?

With most new devices offering Quick Charging, Qualcomm is speeding things up with its newly announced Quick Charge 3.0. This shortens the time required to recharge a mobile device so you can get up and running in no time.  According to Qualcomm, the new Quick Charge 3.0 is up to 38% more efficient than Quick Charge 2.0 and it can do 0 to 80% charge in just 35 minutes. As comparison, OPPO’s VOOC charge does 0-75% in 30 minutes while Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charge on their flagship devices does 0-50% in the same time. Quick Charge 3.0 is available as an option with their newer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, 620, 618, 617 and 430 processors that are expected to be commercially available next year. It is backward compatible with previous Quick Charge supported devices and it supports various USB standards including the latest USB Type-C.  Going down to specifics, Quick Charge 2.0 is able to charge dynamically with 4 voltages – 5V, 9V, 12V and 20V.

Alexander Wong,U Mobile has an online store and it could be the best place to buy an iPhone 6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/u-mobile-has-an-online-store-and-it-could-be-the-best-place-to-buy-an-iphone-6/,"iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Malaysia,iPhone 6 Plus,iPhone 6 Plus Malaysia,iPhone 6 Plus price,iPhone 6 Plus U Mobile,iPhone 6 price,iPhone 6 U Mobile,U Mobile,U Mobile Online Store","iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"U Mobile finally has an  online store  where you can buy new smart phones with telco plans from the comfort of your home. Since it is new, there’s only a handful of products available which includes the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C and the Galaxy S6.  With the recent  price hike for the iPhone 6  in Malaysia, U Mobile appears to be the only telco selling the device outright on prepaid and it is a more affordable than the usual market price. With its U Mobile Prepaid bundles, the iPhone 6 16GB costs just RM1,982 and it calculates to just RM2,395.60 in total inclusive of the required top up and refundable upfront payment. That’s cheaper than the  RM2,699  asking price for the same unit without contract. Since U Mobile prepaid has no contract, you can leave at anytime but you’ll lose out the potential savings from the upfront payment rebates that goes into your credit balance over 24 months. Still, this is a better option than buying one outright. If you look at the iPhone 6 Plus offer, the largest 128GB is going for RM3,381 all in (inclusive of GST, upfront top up and payment). That’s cheaper than the iPhone 6 Plus 64GB  priced at RM3,699  currently.  Interested? You can head over to  U Mobile’s online store  and it appears that some models in specific colours are already out of stock. If you’re eyeing for an iPhone 6, this is probably your last chance to get it at old prices."
Arif Lee,"3 years later, we have a new Siri enabled Apple TV",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/11/3-years-later-we-have-a-new-siri-enabled-apple-tv/,"apple,Apple 2015,Apple Keynote,Apple Siri,Apple TV,Apple TV 2015,Siri,Siri remote","Apple,Cool stuff,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Others",2015-09-11,"Tim Cook candidly jested said that Apple took a “really long” time to bring an upgrade to the 2012 version of the Apple TV – even chuckling along with the crowd following the statement. Apple’s take on the TV set-top box is now bigger, more powerful and built with Siri to assist you through the new operating system. An overhaul that sees it now carrying a powerful 64-bit A8 CPU and PowerVR GX6450 GPU, together with 2GB of RAM. Significant jumps in each category; that sees Apple also adding more internal storage (32GB or 64GB), a better WiFi radio (802.11ac) and even a redesigned tvOS. A great operating system that will see the Apple TV now support Apps and have an accelerometer and gyroscope on its newest remote. Connectors on the small black box are similar on past editions, a power, HDMI and an ethernet port. With an addition of the app store for tvOS, Apple hopes that its third-party developers will expand and further the device’s functionality that places a new emphasis on gaming. You’ll be using the newly designed remote that comes with a glass touch pad on the top end that connects to your box through Bluetooth 4.0. Embracing voice-recognition and utilising Siri as its personal assistant, it’ll be one of the best ways to interact with your Apple TV but currently only has support in these 8 countries: For everyone elsewhere, the Siri button on the new controller will only get you to an “open the on-screen search app”. It’ll probably have the same traits as its predecessor, only with larger search functionality. Don’t be downhearted, if you’re initial thoughts were to pick it up, because Apple usually rolls support as the device’s lifetime lengthens. You’ll be able to ask the female personal assistant things like: Apple TV’s gaming experience will now have a shot at rivaling the Nintendo Wii, thanks to the new Siri remote that includes the accelerometer and gyroscope. During the keynote we saw a multiplayer game dubbed Crossy Road, which allows users to tether an iPod Touch or iPhone as an additional remote. Also demoed, was Beat Sports, a music and sports combo that sends music timed baseballs for you to hit. Apple’s main showcase to its new gaming element will be Disney Infinity 3.0, Guitar Hero Live and Rayman Adventures’, surely pleasing a wide range of gamers out there. A further extension of apps bring about a demonstration of online shopping directly on Apple TV, thanks to companies like Gilt – giving Apple an edge when compared to other set-top boxes out there. Obviously they won’t be leaving out the main purpose of the device, providing TV enthusiasts the viewing tools to get push notifications for game-time moments in live sports games. Potentially a great living room companion, the Apple TV starts shipping towards the end of October in 80 countries and will go for $149 / RM 641 (32GB) and $199 / RM 856 (64GB).

Alexander Wong,"iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus announced with upgraded specs, tougher materials and it’s thicker than before",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-announced-with-upgraded-specs-tougher-materials-and-its-thicker-than-before/,"apple,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s announcement,iPhone 6s launch,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"Apple has just announced its new  iPhone 6s  and the larger  iPhone 6s Plus  phablet, and like every iPhone “S” model, it is an update over its previous model without having an all new design. This time around, it is more than just incremental performance upgrades. The new iPhone 6s uses tougher materials to silence its  bendgate  critics and it incorporates its Force Touch and Taptic engine features from the  Apple Watch . There’s also a new colour for the iPhone that’s called Rose Gold. This is possibly the biggest iPhone incremental “model update” since the  iPhone 4S .   Like the iPhone 6/6 Plus duo, the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus retains the same 4.7″ and 5.5″ Retina Display option. No changes in display resolution but underneath its metal unibody shell is an upgraded 64-bit A9 chip that promises up to 70% better performance over its previous A8 processor. The M9 motion co-processor that keeps track of your activities is now integrated onto the A9 chip, which helps to improve performance and battery life. Now it gets the additional ability to track your running as well as your walking pace in addition to steps, distance and elevation.  While the overall design looks the same as the previous model, the iPhone 6s/6s Plus is actually slightly bulkier and heavier than its predecessor. This is probably due to its new use of material that comprises of 7000 series Aluminium, the strongest they’ve ever fitted on an iPhone and special dual ion‑exchange process glass which they claim to be the strongest in the smart phone industry. As a result, it adds 0.1-0.2mm to its thickness, width and length. The weight should be noticeably heavier with 14 grams extra on the iPhone 6s (6s: 143g, 6: 129g) and 20 grams more on the iPhone 6s Plus (6s Plus: 192g, 6 Plus: 172g).  In terms of colours, Apple is still retaining the same Silver, Space Grey and Gold but it now gets a Rose Gold colour option which is a more feminine with a pink hue. Nothing has changed in terms of storage as Apple continues the same 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacity options. Personally we wished Apple had killed the 16GB option and set 32GB as the bare minimum for a flagship.  After toying around with Force Touch trackpads and watches, the pressure sensitive tech has finally made its way onto the iPhone as 3D Touch. This gives the multi-touch display another form of interaction as it is able to differentiate soft to hard presses. With a gentle touch, you can now preview links while hard presses bring up additional shortcuts and menus on iOS 9.  From the home screen, you can jump straight into selfie or slow-mo videos by hard pressing on the camera icon. Alternatively you can jump straight to Inbox or New Message when you do the same on the Mail icon. In short, this is like having a right click function on a computer. Developers can also take advantage of 3D Touch as well with games making use of the finger pressure for additional controls.  The iPhone 6s/6s Plus also gets a Taptic engine which gives a more immersive feedback as you force touch into the display. Like the Apple Watch, this gives you a sensation of a glass being tapped or pressing through the glass that feels more realistic than the conventional buzzing vibration. Speaking of touch, the Touch ID fingerprint scanner has been improved with its 2nd generation unit, promising quicker response time than before. As the competition  beefs up  its camera capabilities, Apple has finally upgraded its iSight camera in pixel count from 8MP to 12MP with f/2.2 aperture. This is the first major camera upgrade since the iPhone 4S. It still gets dual-tone LED flash for more natural lit pictures while the 6s Plus has the additional feature of Optical Image Stabilisation. Finally 4K Video recording is supported and you can make ultra high resolution movies on the fly with its built-in editing tools. For Selfies, the front FaceTime HD camera has been upgraded from 1.2MP to 5MP f/2.4. To illuminate your face in the low light conditions, the new iPhones get Retina Flash, which basically increases the front display brightness by 3X as a light source.   Another neat feature is Live Photos where it starts shooting before the point of shooting a picture until after a few seconds after that. This gives you a short clip which actually consists of multiple shots and it is done automatically on every single photo that you take, which is kind of similar to HTC’s Zoe. To preview the Live Photo, just simply press harder onto a picture in the gallery for a quick playback.  Only for the US, Apple has introduced its  iPhone Upgrade Program  where anyone can switch to the latest iPhone every single year. It works quite similar to  Maxis Zerolution  where you sign up for a 24 months installment plan with an added option to change phone every 12 months.  According to Apple, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be priced the same as its predecessor at launch and they have reduced the price of its current models. The iPhone 6 Plus in the US carries the same contract price tag as iPhone 6s. With immediate effect, the iPhone 5C has been discontinued, making the iPhone 5S their new entry-level smart phone available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are still in the market but it is now limited to just 16GB and 64GB options. Colour wise, you’re limited to just Space Grey and Silver. So if you want to get a gold iPhone, you’ll have to go for the very latest model.  Pre-order starts this Saturday on 12th September with official sales to begin on 25th September in first wave countries. As usual Malaysia won’t be among the early batch of countries but if you want, you can try your luck in  Singapore ,  Australia ,  China  and  Hong Kong .  When it gets here, we can only assume there will be another round of price hike due to our weakening Malaysian Ringgit against the dollar which currently stands at US$1 = RM4.34.

Arif Lee,Digi is Malaysia’s first telco to offer direct billing on the Google Play Store,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/digi-is-malaysias-first-telco-to-offer-direct-billing-on-the-google-play-store/,"DiGi,Digi Direct Billing,Direct Billing,Google Direct billing,Google Play,Google Play Store,Mobile Direct Billing","Android,DiGi,Industry in General,Mobile Apps,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field",2015-09-10,"Malaysians can finally take advantage of paying for their Play Store purchases through their monthly Digi billings. Further improving a system that sees many Malaysians with no debit/credit cards struggling in the past, to pay for any apps while on their Android devices. Providing this alternative payment channel is an initiative to make the Play Store more accessible to the 22.1 million (approximate figure) Malaysians who currently don’t have a banking card to make payments (data by Bank Negara Malaysia). A testament that holds true for young customers who don’t have the luxury of having access to these cards. Today onwards, Digi customers on postpaid can simply add any purchase (in-app or otherwise) on the Google Play Store and be billed directly to their monthly bill. On the other hand, those on prepaid aren’t left out, as they can use their prepaid airtime balance to deduct the purchases outright. Digi’s Chief Marketing Officer, Christian Thrane shed some light on the partnership – stating that “Digi aims to be the best mobile internet provider for the mass market.” and introducing a service like Direct Billing for Google Play Store serves to add value for their 11.8 million customers. Looking at the Digi website, they’ve also support for the Windows Phone Store app, as well as the Blackberry World app – giving uses on these devices the same Direct Billing feature. The telco provider hopes that their aforementioned efforts will kick-off an echoing effect for mobile app developers to step up localised content for our market.

With the  Apple Watch  app store now supporting 10,000 apps that make use of more 3 rd  party complications, accessing the watch’s hardware – ranging from the mic to its other health related in-built sensors. Apple has even stepped up the personalisation of their two (out of three) watch models. App developers are now tooled to improve their apps thanks to watchOS 2, letting them play around with the watch’s hardware, opening doors to apps like iTranslate; for giving you voice translations on the fly, or the GoPro app, that lets you use your watch display as a viewfinder. Innovating in other fields like those involved in medicine, AirStip has already existed on other iDevices (iPhone and iPad) but with an upgrade to watchOS 2, the app now gives medical practitioners and the hospital team easier accessibility to patient records and their health readings. Daily rounds are displayed on the app, connecting the team within a network that lets them communication and share patient data on a more productive level. Time travel is now enabled and turning the digital crown lets you go through your daily rounds schedule to see upcoming patient visits and other appointments. Developers are also bringing another health monitoring app to the table, with Sense 4 Baby opening the same doors but for mothers and doctors that want to monitor a baby’s health while still in a womb. Sensors placed on the mother’s belly allows this and doctors can get an NST reading straight after the mother does a test at home – making the whole affair a more practical one. To the aesthetic side of things, Apple now adds to its collaboration list with Hermes joining forces to provide luxury watch bands and its own distinctive watch face with Hermes iconography. Hand-stitched leather in 3 options the Double Tour ($1,250/RM5,465), Single Tour ($1,100/RM4,852), and Cuff ($1,500/RM6,557) seems to be Apple’s venture into the more fashionable side of smart wearables. The French artisans made the first option to wrap twice around your wrist, coupling feminine elegance with security of mind. Available for the 38mm stainless steel case, this leather band will come in 4 colours – Fauve, Etain, Capucine and Bleu Jean. Wrapping only once around your wrist, the Single Tour attempts to appeal to both men and women and are available in the 38mm and 42mm stainless steel case. However, the single only comes in the Fauve and Noir, with an additional Capucine band for the 38mm. Hermes caps it off with the Cuff leather option, said to be created to stay in contact with the wrist better for a more accurate heart rate monitoring. It is only available in the 42mm stainless steel case in a Fauve colourway. Subsequently, Apple has also been busy updating their own designs, as two new finishes are now added to the line-up – Gold and Rose gold (38mm and 42mm) are now available in iodised aluminium. Two great colours that maintain the pricing of the original sports line up ($ 349/RM1,526 for 38mm, $ 399/RM1,736 for 42mm). There’s also a product RED version of the stainless steel case, which will have part its proceeds directed towards fighting AIDS. Although most of the updates are already available, the Hermes collection and watchOS 2 are slated to be out in October and September the 16 th , respectively. Unfortunately, Malaysia is once again left out of the list, so we’ll wait and see if Apple decides otherwise in the future. [  SOURCE  ]"

This enabled users worldwide to get a play by play of the latest breaking news that was happening around the globe. September the 10 th  brings the same menu, just tweaking the content to suit a more Malaysian fare. Now available locally, Google Play Newsstand will provide users with content from publications like Berita Harian, NSTP and the Star. Those inclined to know about the country’s current affairs will have access to KiniTV and The Malaysian Insider. It aims to provide not just written content but also images, audio and video – a full sensory experience, which even appeals to those wanting some fashion tips through Esquire Malaysia or Elle Malaysia. On Newsstand you’ll be able to sift through a 2,000 different sources that range from free to paid material. In terms of news Google has teamed up with internationally acclaimed The New York Times, The Guardian and Reuters to name a few; locally, they’ve partnered with Mkini, Karangkraf and Blu Inc.

Alexander Wong,Want to record 4K videos? Don’t buy the iPhone 6s 16GB,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/11/want-to-record-4k-videos-dont-buy-the-iphone-6s-16gb/,"4K Video,4K Video duration,4K Video Recording,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s 4K Video,iPhone 6s camera,iPhone 6s Malaysia,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus Malaysia","Android,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-11,"The  iPhone 6s / iPhone 6s Plus   is out  and it finally gets upgraded with a 12MP f/2.2 main camera that allows you to shoot ultra high definition 4K videos. That’s 4X the resolution of a standard Full HD 1080p clip. While most TVs and displays are still pushing full HD, there are those who prefer to capture moments in the best quality possible in 4K. There’s nothing wrong with that but the biggest concern is always on storage. With greater detail comes bigger file size and that could be a problem if you’re intending of buying the cheapest iPhone model available. MKBHD has gotten a hands-on with the new iPhone 6s and has shared some info on the new video formats. Under the settings page, a 4K video at 30fps would take around 375MB/minute of recording while a standard Full HD 1080p takes up just 130MB/minute. That’s nearly triple the file size just to shoot in the highest quality. Like most smart phones, you don’t really get the full available space as advertised as the storage is often partitioned for the operating system and bundled apps. So if you’re getting a 16GB iPhone 6s, you’re probably left about 10GB of free space once you’ve installed and set up all your essential apps. With just 10GB, that leaves you with enough space for just 27 minutes of 4K video.  If 4K video recording is your thing, it is recommended that you take at least the 64GB model or 128GB if you could afford that extra premium. Alternatively, you can free up more space from time to time with the  SanDisk iXpand , which is like a thumb drive for your phone.  With Apple’s premium iPhone pricing that continues to  get even more expensive  in Malaysia, it is high time for them to kill off the paltry 16GB model. Most of its flagship rivals are pushing 32GB minimum storage as standard especially if it doesn’t come with microSD expansion. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available for pre-order staring tomorrow with full availability by 25th September in first wave countries. If you’re  interested to get one , you can try getting one from Singapore through a family or friend residing there. Prefer to get the current iPhone 6/6 Plus model instead?

Malaysia isn’t going to be in the first wave for iPhone releases anytime soon. So if you’re trying to get your hands on the latest  iPhone 6s  and  iPhone 6s Plus , your best bet is to get from the first wave of countries which will commence pre-orders this Saturday, 12th September with stocks shipping on 25th September. This includes Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, United Kingdom and United States. If you got a friend or relative abroad, buying one overseas is better than getting an overpriced unit through enterprising scalpers. So how much does it cost to get one overseas? Head after the break to find out. In our current exchange rates,  Australia  and  Singapore  are your best options right now with the iPhone 6S priced below RM3,300 for the 16GB version. Of course, 16GB won’t cut it for most power users so the 64GB iPhone 6S option is the next alternative but be prepared to fork out around RM3,800 for it.  Surprisingly the iPhone 6S in 64GB, iPhone 6S Plus in 64GB/128GB are cheaper in Australia but do note that these are based on the today’s rates. If don’t mind paying more to be among the first to use it, you can start pre-ordering this Saturday at 3.01PM in Singapore or 5.01PM in Australia Eastern Standard Time.  As the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus took about 2 months from its official announcement to arrive in Malaysia, the newer models could be launched here sometime in November.

For the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, this marks the 3rd price increase since it went on sale late last year and the recent hike was when the  6% GST came into effect  on 1st April. When the iPhone 6 Plus 64GB was initially launched, it was priced at RM3,149 and now it is sold at RM3,699. That’s RM550 more since launch which is about 17% increase after a year. Suddenly buying iPhones are looking like an investment if you bought one early.  Apart from having the 128GB version discontinued, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus no longer has the Gold colour option.  So if you’re looking for gold, you need to look for the latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.   So for the newer iPhones, be prepared to pay more once they get here. From the looks of it, it would take probably another 2 months and we can only hope that our currency doesn’t slide down further against the dollar."
Alexander Wong,Hands-on: OPPO R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/08/hands-on-oppo-r7-plus-fc-barcelona-edition/,"Barca,Barcelona,FC Barcelona,FCB,Oppo,OPPO Barcelona,Oppo Malaysia,oppo R7 plus,OPPO R7 Plus FC Barcelona,OPPO R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition,OPPO R7 Plus FCB,OPPO R7 Plus Malaysia,OPPOxFCB,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-09-08,"OPPO has just  announced  the  R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition  a few moments ago. Dubbed as the Smart phone of Champions, this is produced for the die-hard Barca fans worldwide. Based on their current premium phablet, it carries the same specs underneath but it gets a couple of extras in the form of accessories and with something extra on the exterior. In the hands, it feels like a regular  OPPO R7 Plus . It comes only in gold and the clear differentiation is the large FCB crest on the metal back right underneath the fingerprint scanner. The front gets a large 6″ AMOLED screen that does 1920×1080 pixels resolution which is encased underneath a 2.5D glass with smooth edges. Swiping through the interface reveals their newer ColorOS 2.1 that’s based on Android 5.1. To remind you that this is a FCB official device, it comes pre-loaded with a FC Barcelona theme draped in blue and red colours.  Powering the R7 Plus is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. For on-board storage, the Chinese market is getting the larger 64GB capacity while the rest of the world settles for a decent 32GB storage option. The main camera uses Sony’s IMX278 13MP RGBW sensor with f/2.2 aperture lens and it is assisted by LaserAF, which boasts an ultra-quick 0.3 seconds focus time.  For selfies, it gets a larger 8MP f/2.4 front camera that comes with a host of beautification features. In terms of connectivity, the R7 Plus is a 4G Dual-SIM device with the 2nd slot performing double duty as a microSD slot when only 1 SIM is being used. Keeping things running is a large 4,100mAh capacity non-removable battery which can be replenished quickly with its VOOC Flash Charging. For the international market, the 32GB version is priced at US$549, which is about RM2,383 in our current exchange rates. For a mere US$50, that could be worth the extra premium as OPPO is throwing in a leather case, a FCB water tumbler, a  VOOC Power Bank  and  a selfie stick  as well. As comparison, the current OPPO R7 Plus is priced at RM1,998 inclusive of GST. If you want something more exclusive, you can try your luck with the autographed units that are going to be auctioned for charity on ebay. You can check out more hands-on photos of the R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition below."
Alexander Wong,Meet the 12.9″ iPad Pro. Apple’s answer to convergence devices,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/10/meet-the-12-9-ipad-pro-apples-answer-to-convergence-devices/,"apple ipad pro,Apple iPad Pro Launch,Convergence Devices,iOS,iOS 9,iPad,iPad Pro,iPad Pro Announcement,iPad Pro Malaysia,Tablet","iOS,iPad,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-10,"The  iPad  has revolutionised the way we consume content on a portable device. It started the whole tablet mania and it became the world’s  fastest selling  consumer product in history. For those needing to do some serious work on the go, the iPad still works but it isn’t as cut out as a real workhorse like the MacBook Air.  With  dwindling tablet sales , the next big wave seems to be focused on convergence devices that blurs the line between tablet and PC like the  Microsoft Surface series . And that’s where Apple is heading with its new iPad Pro that was announced today at San Francisco.  Designed as the ultimate media consumption and productivity tool, the iPad Pro is their largest tablet yet with a huge 12.9″ Retina Display that does 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution. This gives 78% more display area than its current iPad Air 2 and it pushes the same pixel density of 264 pixels per inch.  It is 6.9mm thick, the same thickness as the  iPhone 6  but thicker than the iPad Air at 6.1mm. Being a bigger device, it is heavier as well at 713 grams for WiFi and 723 grams for the Cellular version. As comparison, the original iPad weighs in at 680 grams for WiFi and it goes as much as 730 grams for the 3G + WiFi model. Like the rest of the iPad range, the exterior design is typical iPad and it gets a TouchID enabled home button along with Silver, Gold and Space Grey colour options. What makes this a productivity beast is on the inside. With a newer iOS 9 out of the box, you get more multi-tasking features which include split screen along with more shortcuts to get things done quicker. The A9X 64-bit chip on-board is their most powerful mobile processor yet with almost twice the power of the A8X chip found on the iPad Air 2.  Setting the iPad Pro apart from the mainstream iPad is its new Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessory. Now this is starting to look like a Surface fighting device. The Smart Keyboard is sold separately as a US$169 option (about RM730) and doubles up as a smart cover with a keyboard built-in. It consists of 64 seamless keys that’s spill resistant.  The fabric microfiber of the cover is just 3.2mm thin while the keys pops up slightly at 4mm with its spring-like tension feedback. Attaching the Smart Keyboard onto the iPad is seamless which lets you snap on and use immediately without the need of wireless pairing. Unlike the Surface which has ridges on the sides, the iPad Pro connectors are flush with its 3 smart connector pins.  Steve Jobs used to poked fun at the stylus when the iPhone was introduced. For its new productivity product, they have finally introduced one as the Apple Pencil. This adds another freehand interaction which gives you the familiarity of a pencil.  Boasting a 240 times per second response time, drawing claims to be more real time with no noticeable lags and it recognises pressure from a gentle touch to thicker stroke lines. It even supports shading when drawn sideways, as if you’re drawing with a charcoal pencil. During the keynote, they have invited Microsoft and Adobe on stage to demonstrate the Pencil’s editing capability for both MS Office and Photoshop.  The Apple Pencil lasts 12 hours on a single charge which is juiced up with its lightning connector hidden underneath its silicon cap at the end. To charge it, you’ll need to plug it into the iPad Pro, which would probably look awkward if you’re carrying it while on the go. Thankfully it manages to rejuice an impressive 30 minutes of battery life from a mere 15 second charge. The Apple Pencil is sold separately at US$99 which is about RM427. One minor gripe is there’s no place for you to keep the Pencil on the iPad Pro and it doesn’t even come with a clip for you to hook it onto the case or a folder. Perhaps that might come as another optional accessory. So for the full productivity suite, the Smart Keyboard and  stylus  pencil will set you back close to RM1,200. Quite a substantial amount to pay compared to the  Surface 3 ‘s Type Cover Keyboard and Pen costing RM479 and RM189 respectively.  For video and music playback, the iPad Pro boasts 4 speakers with a pair of stereo speakers mounted on the top and bottom which rotates according to the orientation you’re in. For imaging, it gets the same 8MP f/2.4 main camera and a front facing 1.2MP HD Facetime unit as the iPad Air 2. Even with its bigger display and power processor, the iPad Pro still pushes its same 10 hour battery life on a single charge.  At this point, you probably know that the iPad Pro will not come cheap. This is going to be a very niche device like the 12.2″ Samsung Galaxy NotePro 12.2 and its higher end model is actually pricier than a full blown MacBook Air 11″ with 128GB at US$899 (RM3,391 Malaysian RRP). With the thinner MacBook around, the iPad Pro potentially could replace the MacBook Air completely. After all, you could run all your regular office and designing chores with iOS versions of MS Office and Photoshop.  The iPad Pro starts from US$799 (about RM3,462) for the 32GB WiFi model, while the larger 128GB unit is sold at US$949 (about RM4,112). For the all round connectivity with 4G LTE support, the 128GB WiFi + Cellular version is priced at US$1,079 (about RM4,700). The iPad Pro goes on sale in November just ahead of the Christmas shopping season. For more details, you can check out Apple’s  iPad Pro  product page."

To celebrate its 3 year partnership, OPPO has introduced its  R7 Plus  FC Barcelona Edition, clad with the Catalan’s football team insignia.   Just like the standard OPPO R7 Plus, the FC Barcelona Edition shares the same internals with a large 6.0″ Full HD AMOLED display. Underneath, it runs on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor mated with 3GB of RAM. From the presentation earlier, China will be getting the 64GB storage option while the rest of the world appears to be getting the 32GB version. For storage expansion, this dual-SIM phablet supports microSD cards up to 128GB which utilises its 2nd SIM slot.   It still gets a 13MP Sony IMX278 camera at the back with dual-tone LED flash and an ultra-quick laser AF while selfies are taken with its front facing 8MP camera. Powering the device is a huge 4,100mAh capacity battery that supports VOOC Flash Charging. According to OPPO, a quick 5 minutes charge can deliver up to 2 hours of talk time. The back of the R7 Plus also comes with a fingerprint scanner which lets you unlock quickly in a single touch. Apart from having a FC Barcelona logo engraved at the back, it comes well kitted with additional goodies including a FC Barcelona leather case, water bottle, VOOC Power bank and a selfie stick. There’s also 5 OPPO R7 Plus units autographed by Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Dani Alves which will be sold through a charity auction on ebay.  In China, the 64GB OPPO R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition is going for 3,999 CNY (about RM2,726) while the 32GB version is priced at US$549 (about RM2,383). Sales in China starts today while the rest of the world would follow shortly within this month. For more info, you can check out the  OPPO R7 Plus FC Barcelona  product page.

Come September the 9 th  at 10 am (Pacific Daylight Time), which translates to the 10 th  of September, 1 am (GMT+8), Apple will provide its livestream of the keynote  here . It’s pretty simple, just visit the site at the aforementioned time, and you’ll see the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) of the big event. Here’s the catch, HLS (used to) only runs on iDevices (but this time around Apple has made some exceptions), so the following list of devices will support the stream: Chances are the 7,000 capacity Bill Graham Civic Auditorium will be packed with media outlets, so be sure to be one of the people to watch it as it happens. An incremental update to the iPhone 6, the 6s is sure to be only internally – upgrades are said to be tailored to a larger 2GB RAM, a faster A9 processor, a 12-megapixel camera sensor and assuming rumours are true, a Force Touch enabled Retina Display.

Alexander Wong,21% of Android devices are on Lollipop. Jelly Bean and KitKat still takes a lion’s share,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/09/21-of-android-devices-are-on-lollipop-jelly-bean-and-kitkat-still-takes-a-lions-share/,"Android,Android 5.0,Android Breakdown,Android KitKat,Android Lollipop,Android Versions,Fragmentation,Jelly Bean,KitKat,Lollipop","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-09,"The new Android M or now known as  Marshmallow  is just around the corner and it is expected to be released along with  2 new Nexus devices . With the new OS version going live, Google has released its latest Android breakdown figures based on active devices on the Android and Google Play ecosystem.  While the current Android Lollipop is gaining momentum taking up 21% (inclusive of Android 5.0 and 5.1), majority of Android devices are still running on KitKat which stands at 39.2%.  What’s more surprising is that a substantial number of devices are still running on versions that are more than 2 years old. If you look at the chart above, a total of 31.8% of Android devices are still on Jelly Bean which covers Android 4.1 to 4.3, making it the 2nd highest used right after KitKat. Meanwhile the rest of the older versions including Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread and Froyo stands under 5%, which mostly should be retired by now.  While the upgrades from KitKat from Jelly Bean seems to be fast, the fact remains that most devices are still being left behind without much software updates. This is partly due to respective device makers that have ended software support for older models or are simply reluctant to make the switch to newer versions in favour of its own custom UI. Some brands especially from China have re-skinned the interface so much, it looks anything but an Android device. Of course, being an open platform, the adventurous ones can find a way to get the latest OS with the use of Custom ROMs.  Unlike Apple or BlackBerry where its has better control over both hardware and software, the Android environment is quite vibrant which sometimes is seen to be fragmented. There are different brands, hardware choices, added features and software customisation involved, making it a challenge to ensure every device maker is on the same page. With software support becoming a huge concern by consumers, some brands have pledged for quicker software updates and pathces especially after the recent  Stagefright incident . [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Arif Lee,There’s already someone lining up to buy the unannounced iPhone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/09/theres-already-someone-lining-up-to-buy-the-unannounced-iphone/,"apple,apple iphone 6s,apple iphone 6s plus,Australia,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s launch,iPhone 6s Plus,iPhone 6s Plus launch,iPhone Australia","Android,Apple,Cool stuff,iOS,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Twitter",2015-09-09,"Starting yesterday, an Australian by the name Lindsay Handmer has been camping outside Sydney’s main CBD Apple store to be one of the first worldwide to purchase the latest iPhone. A brave venture, considering that when the device will go on sale is still unknown; even crazier is the fact that Apple’s keynote only happens tomorrow. Pitching himself outside the extremely well-lit store located on George Street (the same store we visited to check out the  Apple Watch ), has so far spent a day on his fold-able chair and tent combo. His intentions are based on past instances of the Oceanic country being one of the first to have the latest Apple products in store. Handmer has taken this brief moment of fame to (shamelessly) plug his self-created online secondhand technology marketplace, mysparetech.com, since seeing that other individuals have done it prior during their own line-up adventures. Apple’s iPhones tend to hit shelves around the 18 th  of September, if they’re sticking to their existing habits, Handmer will be out in the 12-17 degree Celsius weather for quite some time. Apart of his marketing stunt, the Australian won’t be purchasing the device for himself, instead he intends to auction the device(s) off for a charitable cause –  Mission Australia , a startup that helps the homeless. He’s said that so far “it’s an up and down process” when asked about his experience so far going 24 hours in to the camp-out and had times where he questioned his decision to do so. The legality of it all is kind of up in the air, at least as far as Handmer is concerned, as the police officers he momentarily crossed paths with only pulled up to head into the nearby McDonald’s – at least for now. When more people join in the craze, he plans on keeping the atmosphere high by getting some party lights and music. It’ll be interesting to see how long he lasts out there but he’s fortunate enough to have a 24/7 McDonald’s and some gyms around the vicinity if he needs to get some food and freshen-up. Best of all, he’ll have some company during the weekend, when his fiance joins in. These occurrences are never bad for Apple but the employees at the Sydney store have some raised eyebrows at how the first potential person to purchase the latest iPhone uses a Dell laptop, together with a HTC phone. When asked about this, Handmer merely quipped that “Apple makes great products, but I guess I like the more technical stuff. Android, for those type of things.” and “I just tend to opt for the more affordable side of stuff.” If you’re interested to prepare yourself for a similar adventure, you can follow his journey on  Twitter . Share with us your best experiences of lining up to purchase something, we’d surely like to hear about it in the comments below. [  SOURCE  ]"

Having spent some time with the  honor 7  in London, we’re looking forward how the Malaysian market reacts to this device, possibly outclassing the Huawei P8 in the process. The honor series has raised the bar since releasing their latest device in Europe, which boasts a metal chassis, a first for the honor lineup. Perhaps honor has taken a new turn, as they’ve announced during the release in UK that they want to reach out to the new generation. Capturing the youth is a daunting task but it gets easier if you have an affordable, yet great looking product. Recapping some specs, the honor 7 carries a 5.2-inch Full HD (1920 x1080) IPS-Neo display. Underneath the metal-clad body is a home-grown 64-bit Octa-core Kirin 935 processor, coupled with 3GB of RAM for zippy performance. Internationally, it gets 16GB of on-board storage, opposed to China’s huge 64GB step up option. Luckily there’s support for a microSD card up to 128GB for your expanded storage needs. Photo bugs will be pleased by the larger 20-megapixel sensor (f/2.0 aperture) that makes up the back of the device, along with its finger-print sensor module. On the front, selfies will be taken by an 8-megapixel shooter with soft flash. The lights will be kept on thanks to a 3,100 mAh battery that supports quick charge (0-50% in 30 minutes). A feature packed device that weighs in at 157 grams and 8.5mm thick. Operating system-wise it runs on EMUI 3.1 over Android 5.0 Lollipop. Malaysians love a bargain but there’s no info on the pricing as the vmall  registration link  leads to nothing (we checked), a bug that we hope the webmasters can sort out since many would be interested in this device. Its predecessor was launched at RM999 but the latest honor could see the price hover around RM 1,200 to RM 1,300, mainly dependent on how our currency continues to float on trading. We’re most probably going to hear something from the China based company soon regarding its pricing, as they usually do so before sales kick off. In the mean time, you can watch our hands-on of the honor 7 below:

Although the version number is newer, it doesn’t seem to fix the  Stagefright  exploit. Hopefully this means there are more updates to come and it is good that Sony is still taking care of its ageing flagship devices. As usual, the updates should be pushed Over the Air (OTA), but to get it quicker we recommend you to check using the Sony PC Companion desktop app. From the looks of it, the Android 5.1.1 is being pushed to Xperia Z users before the Xperia Z1.

Jump straight to  Page 3  to find out which is the best as voted by you. It’s time for another round of smart phone camera shootout. In our last  camera blind test , most of you  picked  the  Galaxy Note Edge , followed by the  Galaxy S6  as the camera of choice. With the  Galaxy Note5  released with a similar 16MP sensor, is it better than the rest of today’s new smart phones? To find out, we’ve taken pictures with 10 devices and we are letting you decide which is the better shooter. For this shootout, we have the Galaxy Note5, the Galaxy S6 edge, iPhone 6, OnePlus 2, Sony Xperia M5, honor 7, HTC One E9+, Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the LG G4. The Galaxy S6 edge has an impressive camera and the new Note5 shouldn’t be far off. Following closely is the LG G4 which boast a similar 16MP sensor, faster f/1.8 lens and it comes assisted with Laser AF.  In terms of pixel count, the Sony Xperia M5, honor 7 and HTC One E9+ leads on paper with its 20MP+ sensor. Like everything we’ve seen in the past, a higher pixel count doesn’t necessary represent higher quality. The Xperia M5 and honor 7 looks promising as it uses Sony’s latest IMX230 sensor that has Phase Detection AF for faster focus. While we are at it, we’ve also thrown in the Xiaomi Mi Note, Huawei P8 and the OnePlus 2 that comes with a 13MP camera with OIS.  Of course, we can’t forget the iPhone 6. It might have the lowest pixel count at just 8MP but it is still impressive with its ease of use and snappy response.  We want you to pick the top 3 photos from each set. For example, here’s how you can rank the top 3 pictures in Set 1, from best to worst: I, E, C. Just so you know, the smart phones are randomised so each alphablet represents a different device in each set. Then the reader proceeds to rank sets 2 – 4. So your votes should appear something like this: Submit your votes in the comment section down, we’ll tabulate the results. Voting closes on Sunday, 13th September and we will reveal the results on the following Monday on the same post. Head to the  next page  to view the pictures and enjoy!"
Alexander Wong,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ Malaysian Telco Pricing,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/04/samsung-malaysia-galaxy-note-5-s6-edge-plus-celcom-digi-maxis-umobile-comparison/,"Celcom,Comparison,DiGi,Dual Sim,Maxis,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus price,samsung malaysia,Telco Comparison,Telco Price Comparison,U Mobile","Android,Celcom,DiGi,Maxis,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Players on the Field,Samsung,U Mobile",2015-09-04,"Want to buy the latest  Galaxy Note 5  or  S6 edge+  but not sure which telco plan is the right one for you? We’ve compared the current postpaid contract offers in Malaysia, to assist you with your purchase decision. Outright, the Galaxy Note5 is priced at RM2,699 and the S6 edge+ is at RM3,099, inclusive of 6% GST.  Buying one without a contract is probably the most convenient way to go but you could save some money with telco subsidies. At the moment, our 4 main telcos – Celcom, Digi, Maxis and U Mobile have started their contract bundle plans for the Galaxy Note 5, while the S6 edge+ is offered by everyone except U Mobile for now. Across the board, they are pretty much tied with 24 months duration with exception for Digi where it has a shorter 12 months option. As always, we recommend picking a plan based on your usage. So it is best to find out roughly how much data, calls and SMS you’ll need to avoid paying more than what you need. To calculate the cost of ownership of each plan, we add up the bundle price of the device together with the minimum subscription amount that you need to pay throughout the contract period. Below is the comparison chart which you can click for a larger view. Celcom 
On Celcom, there’s just 2 choices. A FIRST Basic Plan at RM85/month that optimises between 5GB of data, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS or 2GB of data, 700 minutes of calls and 700 SMS. The next option of FIRST Elite comes with 2 SIM cards – one with up to 5GB of data, unlimited free calls/SMS and the 2nd SIM which gives you 3GB of data, 200 minutes of calls and 200 SMS. The amount of data and calls have been revised slightly with more data and calls than before. Digi 
Digi offers the widest choice from as little as RM78/month up to RM238/month on its SmartPlan. To cater for different type of customers, each SmartPlan has an option of having more Voice or more Data. As part of their current promo, all plans from SmartPlan 78 and above will get additional 1GB of data for 6 months (not included in the comparison table above). For Digi, they still charge advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with its 0% interest EPP offer. All plans come with 24 months contract with exception for SmartPlan 78 that also comes with 12 months duration.  Maxis 
In terms of plans, Maxis is offering the Galaxy Note5 and the S6 edge+ through its Zerolution programme which allows you to pay for your phone on a monthly installment without penalties and upfront payments. This however is only offered for its new MaxisONE Plans that come with unlimited calls and SMS starting at RM98/month. The bundled price is the same across all plans and the only difference is the amount of data you need on each month. While unlimited phone calls and SMS is perfect for those making lots of calls, it is quite expensive for those who require more data. It offers the least amount of data per buck compared to its rivals. For the highest MaxisONE Plan 188, they are offering 1GB additional data but it is only for the first 6 months.  For this comparison, we calculated based on the assumption that you will be keeping this device after 24 months. Therefore we are only considering the minimum monthly installment of RM93/month for the Note 5 and RM111/month for the S6 edge+, without the optional RM30/month early upgrade option and RM15/month device protection. If you look at the device price alone, the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ isn’t getting as much subsidy as the other telcos, but the benefit is that you have the freedom to stop at any time without penalty charges. Just pay the remainder balance of the installments and you’re done.  If you do plan to switch phones, the Zerolution RM30/month early upgrade option lets you do so after 12 months. So if the Galaxy Note 6 is out next year, you can just surrender the Note 5, and pay for the Note 6 installments for the next 12 months. Do note that you would need to return your old device in good condition, so it is recommended that you take up the RM15/month device protection offer.  U Mobile 
For now U Mobile is only offering the Galaxy Note 5 on contract and it is bundled with its Ultimate Device Plan that ranges between RM65/month to RM135/month. This is a more data centric plan with a couple of free calls thrown in.  Despite not having unlimited phone calls, the rates are the lowest across the range at only RM0.10/minute. If only U Mobile offered its  new Hero plan  as on option, they would definitely unbeatable in value. Similar to Digi, there’s also an advance payment but it can be waived if you pay by credit card with auto debit enabled for future bills.  Conclusion 
Considering the long contract period you’re signing up for, you should look beyond the cheaper device price tag. Cost comparison is just half the picture and there are also other areas to look at such as the network quality and customer service. Most telco contracts do charge early termination fees so it is best to stick to a telco that would satisfy your needs for the next 2 years without worry.

Arif Lee,LG’s alleged new phablet to carry two displays,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/07/lgs-alleged-new-phablet-to-carry-two-displays/,"LG,LG dual display,LG G4,LG phablet,LG ticker,LG V10,tenaa","Android,Industry in General,LG,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2015-09-07,"Hats off to TENAA for showing us how this potential, yet to be heard of device from LG will look like. With a V10 branding behind along with what looks like a textured backing, it seems that LG is considering the notion of releasing a successor to the LG G Pro 2. What’s most interesting about this just certified device is it carries a smaller display on top of its larger one, next to the camera and flash modules. Previously, its predecessor was considered to be LG’s answer to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but this “ticker” display could possibly set it apart from other large phablets in the same category. This secondary screen could be used to display notifications and other information that would otherwise clutter the primary screen. Sharing a lot of qualities of the smaller G4, it seems to look the part as well – utilising the back-placed power buttons and volume rockers, as seen on the aforementioned smaller smart phone. Regarding the unannounced phablet’s power button, it looks like LG tweaked the design, making it rounder – could this redesign house a finger-print sensor for biometric security? Internally, it’s purported to carry the same Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 processor, mated with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (expandable with a microSD slot). However, being a phablet, word from  @evleaks  goes to state that it’ll have a 5.7-inch QHD display. Camera optics supposedly will be powered by a 16-megapixel rear shutter (a great camera, from what we’ve seen on the LG G4) and a 5-megapixel sensor on the front. We’ve seen this concept before from its Korean competitors,  Samsung ; though still unsure what this “innovation” could bring to the current market as it is. Sources say that we won’t have to wait too long, as the device should be announced sometime in October. What do you think the functionality of the second display could mean for the LG “V10”?

Arif Lee,Lenovo goes the no-brainer route with its PHAB Plus phablet,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/04/lenovo-goes-the-no-brainer-route-with-its-phab-plus-phablet/,"Huawei P8 Max,IFA 2015,Lenovo,Lenovo PHAB,Lenovo PHAB Plus,PHAB,PHAB Plus,Samsung Galaxy W","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-09-04,"Termed to be a phablet, the PHAB Plus seems to be Lenovo’s answer to the already blurred line of phone to tablets. Measuring at a humongous 6.8-inch, the manufacturer claims the device is optimized for one-handed use, but that remains to be seen (even to those with fairly large hands). Announced at IFA, the Chinese tech company released two phone dubbed the PHAB Plus and the oddly (bigger) named PHAB. The former is the higher-end device, hence the name and it sports a FHD 1920 x 1080 resolution screen. Other specs includes dual-SIM 4G LTE support, 2GB of RAM and runs an Octa-core Snapdragon 615 SoC. 32GB is the standard for internal storage out of the box and is easily expandable through a microSD card. Lenovo’s PHAB Plus dons a 13-megapixel rear sensor along with a 5-megapixel front lens for your photo taking needs. To round off the internals, it carries a 3500 mAh battery to juice all the other components and weighs in at 229g. Moving on to the entry-level PHAB, unsuitably being the more affordable option, you’d expect it to smaller but this “phablet” maxes out at just a hair under 6.98-inches. Although, its screen gets a size step-up, it runs at a lower 1200 x 720 resolution and has less RAM (1GB) on board. Processor-wise it’s a mystery but it is an Octa-core Qualcomm chipset. Forgoing a lot when specs are considered, it does fortunately carry a bigger 4250 mAh battery to power its bigger display. Both phone/tablet/whatever you want to call it runs on Android 5.0 out of the box for its OS. However, if you’re interested in this peculiar market-segment, you’ll be happy to know there are other considerations out there; like the  P8 Max  and the  Samsung Galaxy W . Pricing for the two Lenovo devices are $300 for the PHAB Plus and $180 for the PHAB. [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

The folks at Lowyat had spotted some  social chatter  indicating that the  invite codes  are being distributed on a first come first serve. A couple of weeks back, Maxis had started its  registration of interest  for the OnePlus 2 and it will be sold through an invite system like the rest of the world. Now  MDroid  has come across a brochure, which indicates the OnePlus 2 retail price tag of RM1,687 (likely without GST).  If you include GST, that comes up to RM1,788 outright and we are not sure if this is the 16GB or 64GB storage version. As comparison, the US pricing for the OnePlus 2 stands at US$329 (about RM1,418) for 16GB and US$389 (about RM1,676) for the 64GB version., so it is more likely we are getting the higher option. The current  OnePlus One  with 64GB is priced officially at RM1,199 (excluding GST).  For a more affordable way of owning the device, Maxis is also offering the OnePlus 2 on its  Zerolution  program from RM58/month. This comes up to RM1,392 across 24 months if you don’t plan to upgrade mid-way. For those plan to switch phones after a year, you can opt for its RM30/month early upgrade feature and top up another RM15/month for its Device Protection program. The Zerolution feature however is only applicable if you sign up with the  new MaxisONE plan  that starts from RM98/month. To recap on the specs, the OnePlus 2 offers a 5.5″ Full HD display and it is powered by a 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 4GB of RAM. You get either a 16GB or 64GB storage option that isn’t expandable. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, Laser AutoFocus and Dual-tone LED flash light. Powering the device is a larger 3,300mAh capacity battery which is non-removable. Some of the new features for the OnePlus 2 includes a USB Type C connector, one-touch fingerprint scanner at the front and a new notification alert slider on the left side of the device. Since this is an international unit, it will come with OxygenOS that offers a stock Android like experience based on Android 5.1. This time, the OnePlus 2 supports dual-SIM cards in nanoSIM size with 4G LTE connectivity support. Assuming this is the 64GB model, will you get this over other flagships available today?

Seeing this problem has placed smartphone manufacturers left to choose between mediating the overheating issue or omitting the infamous chipset all together. Weighing two sides of the coin, Sony has decided to take the riskier route. For one the Z5 Premium, it seemed that no other component would’ve been more appropriate to push its 4K screen. So how did Sony attempt to keep temps low? A teardown revealed that Sony has built a special dual heat pipe on the upper part of the smartphone’s frame to improve ventilation. In addition, they’ve also added thermal regulating paste underneath the processing chip to further regulate its running temps. Not a lot of news has surfaced regarding how Sony’s latest offering handles multitasking, gaming and larger processing extensive tasks, so it seems like there’s a lot of real-world testing to be done.

After seeing leaks of its  purported device , HTC is likely to launch the Aero on 29th September in Taiwan as shown in the teaser image above.  Improving over the current HTC One M9, the new device is purported to have a 2.5D curve edge screen at the moment, for a smoother feel around the edges. The screen is reported to be pushing Quad HD resolution and it is toughen by Gorilla Glass 4. In terms of camera, the new unit is said to be having a f/1.9 camera and hopefully it is a huge improvement over its current average HTC One M8/M9 shooters. If the image of the Aero above is real, it looks quite similar to the current iPhone 6 with its metal body and antenna band lines. Can this new flagship  turn their fortunes  around?  Alongside the new HTC One A9 (Aero), the international variant of the  Butterfly 3  is expected to make its debut offering waterproof capabilities. As launched in Japan as the J Butterfly, it gets a similar spec as their current flagship offering with a 5.2″ Quad HD display, 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM and has 32GB of on-board storage. It also packs a 20.2MP Duo Camera at the back and a front facing 13MP shooter for higher resolution selfies. However in the battery department, it gets downsized to just 2,700mAh capacity which raises concern on its overall battery life. In Taiwan, the Butterfly 3 is expected to be priced at TWD 20,900 which is a hefty RM2,700 in our current exchange rates.  [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"
Arif Lee,Smartphone and tablet sales remain buoyant despite GST and weakening currency,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/07/smartphone-and-tablet-sales-remain-buoyant-despite-gst-and-weakening-currency/,"Acer,apple,Asus,gst,huawei,Lenovo,mobile sales 1st half,mobile sales 2015,mobile sales first half,Ringgit,Samsung,weakening ringgit","Android,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Others",2015-09-07,"Malaysians purchased 4.8 million smartphones and 0.9 million tablets during the first half of 2015. Numbers which rose by 42% and 15%, in the two aforementioned categories, compared to the same half of 2014. Predominately, sales were geared towards makers from China and Taiwan for smartphones and the tablet space still leans towards global vendors. These numbers tell a different story, if you’ve been keeping tabs on the recent downward spiral of the Ringgit’s trading value, GST implementation and other of the country’s uncertainties. Seems like the rise in figures are tied to most mobile tech manufacturers adapting a wider ranger of devices that also cater to those looking for a more affordable option. Smartphones hovering around RM 500, pre-bundled with SIM plans and larger tablet slates going for less than RM 300, seemed to make a difference. Taking a look at who received the biggest slice of the pie, numbers by Apple and its Korean competitor Samsung fell opposed to past performances. When looking at the other makers from China and Taiwan, they’ve managed to scrap on by through maintaining their competitive stance on pricing and targeting the local market based on their needs. Nonetheless, Samsung still sits pretty at the top, with a huge majority of 40% – sales coming from their mid-rangers and lower-end models, the Galaxy J series and Galaxy V smartphone. Surprisingly, Samsung’s top of the line Galaxy S6 and S6 edge didn’t stir up a lot of figures. Other major players in the same league were, Asus (20%), Apple (15%), Lenovo (13%) and Huawei (12%). Asus had the ZenFone 5 and the Zenfone 2 to thank, keeping it as number two in an already competitive market segment. More premium in the eyes of the world, Apple held steadily in third position, while the last two let their more budget friendly options do the work: the A319 and A7000 for Lenovo and Huawei’s Honor series leading the way. Tablets, while still performed positively, didn’t have the same rapid adoptive rates, unlike smartphones. Fingers could be pointed that due to the devices costing more, buyers might reconsider purchasing as the larger screened devices don’t always boast a better spec sheet. In similar fashion, Samsung has the largest piece with 30% – sales mostly coming from the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0. The rest of the pie is shared by Lenovo, Apple, Asus and Acer; Lenovo shares the number two spot with Apple (27% each). Asus had about 13% driven by its 7-inch Fonepad 7, while Acer’s telco team-up, managed to get the Iconia Tab A1-713 rolling as well. Have you personally felt the pinch?

Going as the Galaxy View, it made its brief appearance at the end of the Samsung livestream during IFA 2015, earlier in the day. Looking like a propped up Microsoft Surface with its own kick-stand, the Galaxy View left us asking more questions as Samsung only hinted with a couple of phrases for us to put together: “think bigger” and “a new dimension of entertainment”. Oh and they mentioned that more information about this huge “tablet” will be out come October. If the device’s screen does indeed come at an 18.4-inch size, we’re left mystified as to why earlier reports state that it’ll only pack a 1920 x 1080 display (works out to about 119 ppi), a lowly resolution for a screen that size. In terms of processing it packs a bigger punch – thanks to an assumed Exynos 7580 processor, together with 2GB of RAM. The earlier report labels the device as  the SM-T670 or Tahoe but we’re unsure if these two are the same. For in-built storage the device apparently carries 32GB of internal memory that can be expandable through a microSD card. The report also mentions that the device carries an 8-megapixel rear shutter, while the front only gets a lowly 2.1-megapixel camera. Being quite a large display, the device will measure 451.8mm x 275.8mm x 11.9mm and feature a 5700 mAh battery powering it. Currently, Samsung’s largest tablet in their line-up is the Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and it runs a QHD (2560 x 1600) screen. Will Samsung let its latest multimedia consuming tablet only run at a 119 ppi? We’ll only find out in October. Then again the earlier reports are just rumours, so don’t think Samsung has dropped the ball, just yet."

Available in 4 options (one yet to be released): the 46mm, 42mm (male version), 42mm (women’s collection) and the Sport (soon to be announced). Setting the bar apart from last year’s version will be Moto Maker – quoting Motorola, you’ll be able to have 300 distinctive combinations of its customisation that ranges from watch case colour, watch bezel colour and the band. That too plus they’ve added the aforementioned 42mm watch face, to the original 46mm size for females and the guys who prefer a less clunky smart watch. Repositioning of the sole hardware button is also apparent, moving it from a 3 o’clock position to the now more practical 2 o’clock – supposedly to prevent scuffing while moving and flexing your wrist around. All three options run the same 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 mated with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. Its screen(s) come in a 1.56-inch for the 46mm (360 x 330 resolution), while the 42mm gets a 1.37-inch screen (360 x 325 resolution). The thickness of the models are all similar at 11.4mm but differ in battery sizes – 400 mAh (46mm); 300mAh (42mm). Differences on the Sport edition are basically it has an added GPS feature to track your runs and a non-removable 18mm rubber-like band, possibly appealing better to the more active folks. It’ll be a lot easier to view outdoors too, thanks to an AnyLight display that gels together a transmissive and reflective display. The entire line-up features a hot-swappable watch band that uses a distinctive locking mechanism; allowing you to choose from the list of watch band materials, whenever you need to – leather, silicon, leather and metal options. Motorola has kept some “flaws” with the infamous flat-tire making its way back again. The company claims that if you want smaller bezels, you’ll have to sacrifice this OCD-inducing pain black box-ish thing at the bottom of the display. Out of the box, it’ll run Android Wear 1.3 and be equipped with the existing gyroscope, optical heart rate monitor and ambient light sensor, though you’ll be able to have your watch on you if you’re taking a shower, thanks to the upgraded IP 68 rating. Price-wise, it’ll run you back $300 (RM 1,293) – $430 (RM 1,854), depending which personal combination of selections you put together when you pre-order your Moto 360 2 nd  gen on Moto Maker.

Considering its intended price-point (predecessor cost RM 999), it offers a lot – a big battery and display, a finger print scanner and other note-worthy specs on the list. Ergonomics takes a turn for the latest in the G series, thanks to the 2.5D glass on the front and the arched backing. It seems to be bezel-less when your screen isn’t lit, similar to other Huawei phones out there but when active. You’ll be viewing everything on a 5.5-inch FHD screen (1920 x 1080) with 400 ppi. On top of the hardware, Huawei’s Emotion UI 3.1 will be doing the work, skinned on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop. The G8 boasts a 1.7GHz Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615. You’ll also get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage thrown into the mix to handle multitasking and larger apps or photos. In terms of camera optics, the device carries a 13-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 5-megapixel camera on the front. Worrying about your device’s security? The G8 is readily equip with a finger-print sensor on the back, giving you easier accessibility to your device, yet protecting it at the same time. Calling, text and data are supported through a dual-SIM 4G LTE set up but there’s no mention if you have to sacrifice one slot to give way for the MicroSD card. Powering the whole package is a non-removable 3000 mAh battery, which is likely to give you decent amount of juice to last you throughout your day. No local pricing has yet to be announced but the Huawei G8 will go on sale in Europe for €399 (RM 1,895), a larger hole in your pocket, almost twice its  predecessor ; leaving us to think, at that price, you’re better off considering other options on the market.

With the  Samsung Galaxy Note 5  and  S6 edge+  going on sale today, you can either buy it outright or purchase it with a typical telco plan. Since Maxis has launched its new  Zerolution programme , you now have a third alternative which is something worth considering if you hate to be tied down with 24 month lock-in periods that comes with nasty penalty charges.  To refresh your memory, the Zerolution programme is a new way of owning a new smart phone and it comes with added device protection in a form of an insurance as well as the option to swap to a new phone after 12 months. There’s no hefty upfront payments and you can leave at any time without any penalty charges as long as you settle the remainder of your monthly installments in full. The Galaxy Note5 is offered at RM138/month while the Galaxy S6 edge+ can be yours at RM156/month. These installment figures are inclusive of its RM30/month early upgrade fee, which allows you to swap to a new device after 12 months and RM15/month for extra device protection which covers theft and all sorts of damages to your device. Note that for the early device upgrade to happen, you would need to ensure that your device is in pristine condition, hence they have recommended the optional device protection offer. If the device is returned in unacceptable conditions, a RM300 fee might apply when you make a swap. Even if you don’t plan to upgrade or need the extra device protection, the Galaxy Note5 effectively costs RM93/month, which in 24 months cost a total of RM2,232. That’s RM467 cheaper than the full retail price of RM2,699. The Galaxy S6 edge+ would effectively cost RM2,664 in the same calculation, which is a RM435 savings from its RM3,099 outright price. Of course, the catch is that you’ll need to subscribe to their  new MaxisONE Plan  which starts from RM98/month. That comes with unlimited calls, SMS and 1GB of data. For every additional 2GB of data, it will cost you RM30/month extra. Note that the monthly subscription fee is charged on top of your monthly Zerolution phone installments.

For those who prefer to make lots of phone calls including international IDD numbers, their Best Prepaid has been revamped with lower call rates. The new Best Prepaid starter pack cost RM8 and it comes with RM5 of preloaded credit. For starters, you can enjoy 5 sen/30 sec (10sen/minute) calls and 2sen/SMS to 10 of your favourite KAWAN numbers on any network. If you activate by 30th November 2015, you get additional 10 KAWANs, giving you a total of 20 numbers to enjoy the lower call rate. To activate, just dial *128*1*8# and take note that it allows a maximum of 10 KAWAN numbers within Digi and 10 KAWAN numbers from other networks. Calls and SMS to non-Kawan numbers are charged at 10 sen/30 sec and 6 sen per SMS.  IDD calls are incredibly low with rates going from as little as RM0.02/30 seconds. These call rates are applicable only if you dial with the “13200” prefix in front of the phone number.  In terms of data, there isn’t any free basic internet like  Smart Prepaid .

Right on the heels of Apple’s new iPhone release, the Huawei Mate S boasts a smart pressure sensitive screen allowing you to “Force Touch” the display to do more things like zooming into a picture or to preview an object. The screen apparently is so sensitive that it could weigh objects by placing them onto the display. They even  measured an orange’s weight  during the announcement event. The Mate S comes with a 5.5″ Full HD display and it sits right between the 5.2″  Huawei P8  and their 6 incher  Mate 7 . The design of the back looks like an  honor 7  with its subtle curved metal back while the front gets a clean all-glass look that’s smoother around the edges with the use of 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4.   Under the hood, it uses their own in-house developed Kirin 935 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM, that’s also powering the honor 7. You get 32GB of on-board storage on the standard version and there’s a larger 64GB premium version as well. A larger 128GB is said to be released at a later date.  For imaging, it gets the same 13MP f/2.0 4-colour RGBW camera sensor with Optical Image Stabilisation as the Huawei P8, and it is also assisted by dual-LED flash light. For greater controls, the camera interface now comes with professional mode, allowing you to make fine tweaks on ISO, Shutter speed, White Balance and more.  With its protruding camera lens, it is protected by sapphire crystal to keep it away from nasty scratches. The front also gets a larger 8MP f/2.4 shooter and it is illuminated with a front mounted soft LED light.   When the Huawei P8 was launched, they introduced its Knuckle sense interaction, allowing you to take a screenshot by tapping with your knuckle. In reality, that was quite gimmicky and it robbed the P8 of its double tap to wake feature. On the Mate S, they have upgraded its knuckle technology to 2.0 which allows you to perform gesture controls like drawing C for camera using your knuckle. On top of that, the fingerprint scanner at the back also doubles up as a touch pad where you can use it for scrolling vertically or horizontally.  The Mate S also gets 3 microphones which allows recording for multi way conferencing, similar to the Note 4. With a 2,700mAh capacity battery, this is slightly larger than the Huawei P8 and overall it weighs 156 grams with a thickness of 7.2mm. The Huawei Mate S is currently running on Android 5.1 with its own EMUI 3.1 skin on top.  For more details, you can check out the  Huawei Mate S  product page."

Outed as the void-filler in between the One M9 and its yet to be released successor, it looks pretty much like an iPhone if viewed from the back. The official HTC Weibo post states that we will be able to take a look at the device on the 6 th  of September, leaving us to only 4 days before we’ll see the latest HTC smart phone. Since the image’s text was posted in Mandarin, many are still unsure of its meaning – even after getting help from Google translate, which struggled to translate it to English. Supposedly, the text goes to say something along the lines of “the strength to fight bias” and “simple colour value”. Not giving away much, by any means, however, it’ll be a tough climb for the Taiwanese company, if the device they’re releasing doesn’t offer any visual distinction from its competitors (provided the Aero looks like how it does in the  previous  leaks) Internally, that might differ, as the new HTC A9 is touted to be powered by an industry’s first tri-cluster Deca-core (10) MediaTek Helio X20 and a Mali-T880 MP4 graphics processor. It’ll also apparently carry a QHD display with Gorilla Glass 4, protecting it from any unwanted scratches and smudges. Notorious leaker @evleaks posted that this new flagship might carry the “One” title, with the HTC One A9 (Aero) but we’ll wait to see if September the 6 th  confirms his speculation. The late rise of Samsung in the Android market, brought the demise of the HTC name, so we hope in earnest that their new handsome hero can bring back some good news for the company.

Alarms are going off on the Interwebs as Huawei’s continuation of premium metal-clad design and evolution of mobile technology are to include a purported big hardware upgrade on the Huawei MateS. Apparently, the device’s screen will take a hit, shrinking it from the original Mate 7 (6-inch) to 5.7-inches, proving it to be a more one-handed friendly device. Based on leaks, we’ll likely see a better screen-to-body ratio that will help the aforementioned problem. Supposedly carrying a 1920 x 1080 resolution screen, this Huawei phablet is said to have the Kirin 935 processor on board, mated with 3GB of RAM. The device has been rumoured to feature a 20-megapixel rear camera, most probably a Sony IMX 230 module, an 8-megapixel front facing camera and a fingerprint reader as well. Sounds to be an exciting product so far but we’ve kept the best for last – it’ll “likely” have Force Touch on its large 5.7-inch display. Innovation in the area, could see better interaction with our devices, and beating Apple to their own punch (as the iPhone 6s is also rumoured to have this technology on its Retina display). Based on what we’re hearing so far about the MateS, it seems like the Honor 7 and the former share cues in the respective departments: processor, RAM, camera module and finger-print sensor. IFA 2015, in Berlin will be the place to be if you want to know more about this phablet from Huawei. Though, their tweet seems to confirm that the MateS will have Force Touch, Apple still might have a head start, even though they’re set to announce a week later – seeing that they’ve dabbled in Force Touch technology before in their MacBooks and Apple Watches.

Though, we’re likely to always go back to the circle, eventually. Samsung decided to do that very thing, leaving the square faced Gear S for its latest Circular UX Gear S2. Thanks to the circular bezel, it rotates to navigate – interaction with the screen without obstructing views on the 1.2-inch (360 x 360) screen. On the device, other than the rotating bezel navigation you’ll have a home button and a back button to help make your way around the OS. Tempting potential smart watch owners with two user focused designs: the quick detachable silicon band on the Gear S2 and the timeless 22mm leather band on the Gear S2 Classic – allowing buyers to choose based on their lifestyle preferences. Thin and compact at 11-4mm thin (non-3G), the aforementioned screen will allow you to view your notifications on its home-grown Tizen OS running a 1GHz dual-core processor. Utilising a 24-hour activity log, its functions include calendar, e-mail and news glances, as well as text notifications. For the first time ever, the Gear S2 will also come with an e-SIM option that runs on a 3G network. In-built with NFC, you’ll be able to use the function for mobile payment enabled terminals through Samsung Pay. Solving issues with home and car security, the Gear S2 is capable of connecting to smart homes and cars that use smart car keys. The device will allow you to run about for 2-3 days on its 250 or 300 mAh (3G model) before having to charge it with the included wireless charging dock. A smart wearable that will cater to individualistic creature comforts of having a personalised device. Partnering with organisations will allow Samsung to offer a range of visual watch faces and watch bands, allowing you to fully customise your wearable to make it your own. Water resistant with a water and dust resistant IP68 rating across all variants, so the Gear S2 can be worn during any sweat earning activities and it’ll allow you to track your movements through its activity tracker (inclusive of an accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate sensor and so on). The 3 models differ in dimensions slightly and are listed below: All three will run the same aforementioned processor and come with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal memory. They’ll also be equip with Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 for the internet and pairing. Samsung brought great news to its wearable users as the new Gear S2 will now work with other Android devices (not restricted to its Samsung smart phones). Prerequisites for pairing are the smart phone runs Android 4.4 and above, as well as at least 1.5GB of RAM. Slated to go on sale from October onwards, this smart wearable will be  priced  at  €  349 / approx RM 1,645 (Gear S2, non-3G) and  €  399 / approx RM 1,880 (Gear S2 classic) in Europe but no information has come to light on the price of the 3G version. Just to compare, the most affordable Apple Watch Sport 38mm in France costs € 399 / approx RM 1,880. Unfortunately, there’s no mention of its availability and pricing in Asia just yet, so we’ll just have to wait and see if Samsung releases any news in the future.

Arif Lee,Barcelona FC and OPPO team-up could mean a football themed R7 Plus,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/09/02/barcelona-fc-and-oppo-team-up-could-mean-a-football-themed-r7-plus/,"Android,Barcelona FC,Dual Sim,Oppo,OPPO Barcelona,Oppo Malaysia,oppo R7 plus,OPPO R7 Plus Barcelona,OPPO R7 Plus Malaysia,smart phone","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo,Rumour Mill",2015-09-02,"Officially partnering with each other since June, OPPO has seen the success and brand awareness that its competitors have attempted with other well-known footballing clubs, leading it to its first attempt at a branding collaboration. Posts on the Chinese company’s official Weibo account announces a special event that’s to be held on the 8 th  of September, possibly announcing the Barcelona  R7 Plus . Publications in China have been going off since the photo emerged with the Barcelona team pictured and the text “it’s my turn”. The R7 Plus FC Barcelona Edition is purported to match the original R7 Plus, when considering hardware – though it’ll have some sort of Barcelona emblem on the back and pre-installed themes associated with the Catalan club. Recapping some specs of the R7 Plus, it features a huge 6-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) AMOLED display and runs the 64-bit Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor. Memory on the device sits at 3GB of RAM and for internal storage, you’ll get 32GBs (expandable to an extra 128GB via microSD card). If you make use of the aforementioned expandable storage, you’ll utilise the second SIM tray slot on this Dual-SIM 4G LTE enabled phablet. This thin smart phone measures at only 7.75mm thickness but packs a huge 4100 mAh battery that supports VOOC Flash Charging (75% in 30 minutes). The R7 Plus runs a 13-megapixel Sony sensor, which is readily equip with Phase Detection auto-focus and dual-tone LED flash; donning the front is a decent 8-megapixel selfie camera that provides ample amount of pixels to produce selfies. It’ll also feature a finger print sensor on its back under the mentioned camera module. Software is supported by version 2.1 of ColorOS, based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. Initially priced (in July) at RM 1,998 in Malaysia, we’re unsure that with the current specs, OPPO will still be able to market this Barcelona edition at the same price. No mention of pricing has cropped up yet for the Barcelona version but news floating around goes to say that the shipped unit will feature a packaging and accessories carrying the Barcelona name, leaving us to believe it’ll be a true representation of the La Liga giants. Would we see this device sold globally? Most probably, as it’d be foolish for OPPO not to take advantage of the global presence the football club carries. Are die-hard Barcelona fans willing to drop a chunk on the purported device? You tell us. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

It packs a 4K display at the front which is basically 3840×2160 pixels crammed into a 5.5″ screen, giving an insane pixel density of 806 pixels per inch. If you can’t imagine how big a deal this is, it is like squeezing 4x Full HD displays into a single smart phone.  This a huge leap not only for Sony but also for the smart phone industry where most players are still reluctant to jump onto the Quad HD bandwagon due to power and cost practicality. With a display allowing you to watch 4K content in its intended resolution, the Xperia Z5 Premium also gets a newer 23MP 1/2.3″ Exmor RS sensor with a f/2.0 lens. This is a fully upgraded camera since the Xperia Z1 that came with a 20.7MP shooter until its recent Xperia Z3+. It records 4K videos and despite having no Optical Image Stabilisation, the Inteligent Active Steady Shot technology helps to remove unintended shakes from your footages. With a Hybrid AutoFocus system that first featured on the Xperia M5, you can capture moments quicker with its 0.03 second focus time. For the front, it gets a 5MP camera that could also record Full HD videos. Under the hood, it gets the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor as the rest of the Xperia Z5 series and it is mated to 3GB of RAM along with 32GB of on-board storage. Being a 4K consuming and creating device, it allows storage expansion with microSD up to 200GB.  In the audio department, the Xperia Z5 Premium has no compromises with its High-Res Audio support, DSEE HX upscaling and built-in Digital Noise Cancellation. For better audio playback, it gets an S-Force Front Surround speakers and it also records audio in stereo format.  Even with such a high resolution display, the Xperia Z5 Premium still maintain’s Sony’s phenomenal up to 2 days of battery life thanks to a much larger 3,430mAh capacity battery. The long battery life is achieved with a built-in memory on the display which cuts down processor utilisation when the screen isn’t refreshed. To juice up faster, it supports QuickCharge 2.0 that could give you 5.5 hours of use with just a 10 minute charge.  In terms of design, it is slightly thicker at 7.8mm and it weighs 180 grams. On the right side, the iconic physical power button has been replaced with a capacitive unit which doubles up as a one touch fingerprint scanner. To live up to its Premium name, the device comes with a stainless steel frame and it comes with a mirror finish Black, Gold and Chrome colours. As always, the Xperia Z5 Premium is also water and dust resistant with a capless micro USB charging port with IP68 rating. In terms of availability, the Xperia Z5 Premium will be available from November 2015 and it comes in both Single and Dual SIM variants.

This time it will be released in 3 sizes – a Z5 Compact, a mid-sized Z5 and a larger Z5 Premium version. Thanks to a  couple of sources , we now have a clearer look at the new Xperia flagships ahead of its official announcement.  In terms of design, the overall shape hasn’t change since the early Z series with its omni-balance approach of having a flat slab with subtle rounded corners. Gone is the iconic chrome power button and it is replaced by a wider flat looking one which potentially could double up as a fingerprint scanner. The frame has a poly-carbonate looking material with matte finish, while the premium version seems to have a glossy look to it. We are not sure if the devices shown here is a final product but it looks more sturdy than the previous version. Retained also is the standard volume rocker and dedicated camera button, and the micro USB port is exposed just like its newer waterproof devices. On the left side, all 3 models has the word Xperia written and it still gets a flap cover which potentially still houses both Nano-SIM and microSD expansion. The back hasn’t changed since the beginning of the Xperia Z series and it is shown to carry a 23MP 1/2.3″ sensor, which is an upgrade over its current 20.7MP shooter on the Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z3+.  In terms of specs, the Xperia Z5 Compact will get a 4.6″ HD 720p display, while the Xperia Z5 retains the similar sized 5.2″ Full HD display. For the Xperia Z5 Premium, it is said to be a larger 5.5″ screen that pushes a  Quad HD display of 2560×1440  4K display at 3840×2160. According to leaked  benchmarks , both Xperia Z5 Compact and Xperia Z5 will be running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor and it gets 3GB RAM for the Z5 and just 2GB RAM for the Z5 Compact. In terms of storage, the benchmarks suggest 32GB on-board for both models. They are also expected to receive a 23MP main and a front facing 5MP camera. Strangely the front camera is a notch below its current Xperia M5 and Xperia C5 Ultra that comes with a 13MP front shooter.  So far there isn’t any indication on the Z5 Premium specs but it is likely to carry better specs with 4GB RAM being a possibility. The Xperia Z5 is expected to be announced early tomorrow morning and we will find out the full specs by then. Do you like what you see? Or did you prefer if Sony went bonkers with an all new design?

Still running on a 2 flagships per year cycle with no signs of slowing down, the Xperia Z5 marks yet another evolution with some welcome upgrades.  The Xperia Z3+ or better known as the Xperia Z4 in Japan was seen as stop gap measure launching just months ahead of IFA 2015. Now the Xperia Z5 and its Z5 compact appears to be a more worthy replacement of its former Xperia Z3 series, launched exactly a year ago. In terms of design, the Xperia Z5 still looks familiar but there are some subtle tweaks to its appearance. The aluminium frame now gets a carved Xperia on the sides and the iconic power button has been replaced with an integrated fingerprint scanner. In the past Xperia Z series, the glass back is elegant to look at but it is also a huge fingerprint magnet. This time, Sony has opt for a frosted glass back, which aims to put an end to smudgy looking phones. Surprisingly the dimensions of the Xperia Z5 is identical with the Xperia Z3 at 7.3mm thick and it weighs slightly heavier at 154g (Xperia Z3: 152g). This makes the Xperia Z3+ the thinnest and lightest Xperia Z flagship at just 6.9mm and 144g respectively.  The front display is the same 5.2″ Full HD unit and under the hood it gets the same 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board storage still stays at 32GB with expandable storage made possible with microSD up to 200GB. Like the  Xperia Z5 Premium , the new 23MP sensor takes centre stage at the back, promising ultra-quick captures with its 0.03 second focus time. For selfies, it gets the same 5MP shooter as the Xperia Z3+ along with a wide angle 25mm lens. The battery on the other hand is slightly smaller than the Xperia Z3+ at 2,900mAh but Sony still reckons it maintains the same up to 2 days of battery life on a single charge.  In terms of colours, the Xperia Z5 comes in Graphite Black, Gold, White and Green. It is also available in either Single and Dual-SIM variants, supporting 4G LTE.  Offering a flagship experience without the bulk, the Xperia Z5 Compact comes with a smaller 4.6″ display that does HD 720p (1280×720) resolution. It shares the same Snapdragon 810 processor as the bigger Z5 brother but it comes mated with just 2GB of RAM. Storage remains unchanged at 32GB and it also gets the same 23MP main and 5MP front cameras. Keeping the lights on is a 2,700mAh capacity battery that’s rated to last up to 2 days.  Being a more youthful device, the Z5 Compact comes in Graphite Black, White, Yellow and Coral colours. Overall, it is slightly thicker at 8.9mm but it weighs a much lighter 138 grams. Both the Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Compact runs on the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop and both are expected to go on sale internationally from October 2015 on wards.

Flash-forward to the last day, which allowed us to see the new Zenfone 2 Deluxe and the Zenfone 2 Laser. As the name implies, the 2 Laser has a 13-megapixel shutter on the rear, that’s equip with laser auto-focus and dual-LED to boost its camera taking ability. Seems like ASUS wants put its Zenfone devices in smaller niche categories by making them differ in small aspects. However, we aren’t sure this is a great strategy to begin with. Nevertheless, the determining factor that sets the Zenfone 2 Laser apart from the Zenfone Selfie, is omission of the 13-megapixel sensor on the selfie camera, no dual-LED up front and tuning the internal specs a tad lower. It’s quite unfortunate that Malaysia will be getting only the mid-range model from the list of three Zenfone 2 Laser devices released. Zenfone 2 Laser on the left, Zenfone 2 on the right The Zenfone 2 Laser has an entry level 64-bit capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 410, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Although, being a slouch in the processing department, the device is no slouch in the cellular connectivity department – LTE enabled dual-SIM support. Sporting a 5.5-inch display with only 720 p resolution, the smart phone is powered by a large 3000 mAh battery and runs on a ZenUI skinned version of Android 5.0 out of the box. Upping the stakes on its current Zenfone 2 series, ASUS also announced pricing of the Zenfone 2 Deluxe. An upscale model that redesigns the back to look like intricate polygons scales, purported to increase the grip of the device. That aside, ASUS also decided to maintain the Intel Atom Z3580 to 2.3GHz but double the internal storage to 128GB. Once you’ve considered the two, otherwise, the Zenfone 2 Deluxe is pretty much the same as the high-end Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) model. Packing 4GB of RAM and even a microSD slot for additional storage (up to 128GB), given that you’ve stuck out on your already existing 128GB of internal memory. It’ll also run the 5.5-inch IPS screen at FHD (1920 x 1080), that’s present on the ZE551ML. ASUS’s latest premium device supports 4G LTE on its Dual-SIM capable phone that has a 3000 mAh battery (fast charge enabled). Lastly, it runs the same ZenUI skinned Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. Slated to arrive in retailers from the first week of September onwards, the Zenfone 2 Laser will run you back RM 799 (w/ GST), while the Zenfone 2 Deluxe will cost nearly double, at RM 1,599 (w/ GST) and the existing 64GB high-end ZE551ML Zenfone 2 costs RM 1,399 (w/ GST). Stay tuned for a breakdown of all the Zenfone models, so you can easily decide which device suits your needs."

Worse still, they never decided to tackle this issue for five years, until now; thanks to an update you’ll be the boss and decide how you want your photos to be oriented. Way back when the app first popped up on the Apple App Store, it was fine to stick to squares, as then we’d be viewing them on our then 3.5-inch screens (if you had an iPhone at the time); we all know that isn’t that case anymore, as the average screen now sits around 5-inches, give or take. So it’s great that half a decade later, they’ve finally succumbed to the pressure to support landscape and portrait views. Quoting the photo app, it mentioned that 20% of photos and videos posted on the medium aren’t uploaded in a square format. Now however, you’re given the freedom to choose to your liking with a format icon that lives on the photo app. Devs also thought it would be a great idea to roll out a merged filter system that goes across stills and videos. Check your Instagram now to make use of this nifty feature and if you aren’t on version 7.5 yet, be sure to upgrade on either the  Apple App Store  or the  Google Play Store . [  SOURCE  ]"

Early adopters are gonna be in for a ball, as Samsung Malaysia will be giving out free accessories worth up to RM 538 with purchase of a  Galaxy Note5  or  Galaxy S6 edge+  during its roadshow events on the 4 th  of September; in these three locations – Sunway Pyramid (Kuala Lumpur/Selangor), Gurney Plaza (Penang) and Sutera Mall (Johor Bahru). If you’re in to brave the potential crowds on said date, you’ll be getting a huge 11,300 mAh Samsung Battery Pack (RM 306 value) and the Wireless Charger (RM 232 value) absolutely free. The mobile device maker has also thrown in a special 50% off on any second purchase of a Galaxy Note5 but you’ve gotta be the first 100 in line for the Sunway Pyramid roadshow and the first 50 for both the Penang and Johor launch – making only 200 individuals lucky enough to snap up the Note5 at half its RRP of RM2,699. Basically you will be paying half price for a device that packs a 5.7-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) display that’s powered by a 2.1GHz Exynos 7420, mated with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Other than that, it’ll have 32GB of internal storage; unfortunately, there will be no MicroSD slot on the Note5 that weights in at a mere 171g. Images are captured better thanks to a 16-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel front-facing snapper – both sensors have an f/1.9 aperture, making low light shots a better experience. Samsung also decided to omit the hot-swappable battery, which stands at 3,000 mAh. With omissions, there are definitely new inclusions, as the device now supports Dual-SIM LTE slots. You’ll see the same specs on the Galaxy S6 edge+ too but it’ll differ in two aspects – the captivating dual edged display and no S Pen on board. Its definitely meant to be more of a screen upgrade from the original 5.1-inch Galaxy S6 edge and improve its rigidity by upping the aluminum to a 7000 series. Existing Note users won’t be left out either, as Samsung has let them upgrade through their  trade-up  program. Below you’ll find the listing of value matched to the corresponding models. Still feeling unsure of buying a phablet? You’re in luck, cause Samsung also dropped the prices for the smaller Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, for the duration of the roadshow.

With the  iPhone  6s announcement expected in the next couple of weeks, we’ve already caught  bits and pieces  of the upcoming device. The latest one we have here are images of the iPhone 6s display along with what looks like the chip responsible for the rumoured  Force Touch  enabled display. From the images, it also appears that the next iPhone might be slightly thicker than its predecessor, which confirms rumours that the iPhone 6s will have a different width as the  iPhone 6 . The chip is also a wee bit thicker than the rest of the display components, resulting in Apple needing to make a cut out for it just to preserve the general thickness of the rest. The new display is apparently 2 grams heavier than the display on the iPhone 6, but the brand is planning on compensating for the extra weight with a lighter rear cover. But will that solve the  Bendgate  issue or make it worse? For those not in the know, Force Touch is essentially a feature that’s currently available on the  Apple Watch  and the  12 inch Macbook  which allows users to access functions based on pressure applied on the screen or trackpad. The next closest thing to Force Touch would be gesture controls, which is a feature that’s already available on certain Android devices from ASUS and  Huawei  for example. Still, no one else has yet managed to re-create anything like Force Touch just yet, so depending on how popular it gets with the new iPhone 6s, it might very well be the next thing the phone companies try replicate. Like  fingerprint  scanners. We have yet to get a chance to see Force Touch in action on the new phone yet, but the iPhone 6s is expected to be announced on 9th September. [ SOURCE ]"

The  Pebble  is a perfect example of a functional smart watch but for some, it is still too much to pay for a digital accessory. At the  honor 7  global launch in London, they have  announced  the availability of its new honor band that could bring smart watches to the masses with its affordable price tag.  The design of the honor band is simple. A round OLED display that’s surrounded by a metal frame without any use of buttons. Navigation is done simply by swiping and tapping onto the black and white OLED screen. However essentially this like having a  Huawei TalkBand  underneath and it tracks your steps, sleep, display alerts and you can find out who’s calling you while your phone is in your pocket.  The “watch” itself is pretty slim and the overall package including the rubber strap is rather light. If you’re wondering if you could take this for a swim, you would be pleased to know that it has IP68 water and dust resistance which they say is capable of being submerged under 10 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. In terms of battery life, the honor band does up to 3 days on a single charge. There isn’t much details on the full specs including the display resolution and battery size, and we are told that these units aren’t final for full commercial release.  There are 3 colours available – Black, White and Khaki. For the European market, the band will be available sometime in Q4 2015 and it carries a price tag of 79 Euros or 59 GBP. That’s approximately RM370-RM380 in our current exchange rate. There’s no info on Malaysian availability just yet but we are told to stay tuned for future local announcements. If you’re just looking for something basic, the honor band could be your cup of tea. For those wanting more with a longer battery life, you could top up around RM50 extra and go for a Pebble smart watch that’s currently priced at US$99 (about RM415).  Before you pass any judgement on the “honor band” name, they are actually running a naming contest from now until 27th September. If your suggested name gets picked, you will win the opportunity to use all honor products for the next 5 years. To participate, just head over to the  honor Facebook page , drop your suggested name and your reasons under the Facebook comments."
Arif Lee,Apple schedules annual announcement on the 9th of September,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/apple-schedules-annual-announcement-on-the-9th-of-september/,"apple,apple ipad,Apple iPhone,Apple TV,iOS,iOS 9,iPad,iPhone,iPhone 6S,iPhone 6s Plus,operating system,OS X El Capitan,WatchOS 2","Apple,Industry in General,iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-08-28,"Fall has a tendency to be the season that Apple chooses to make its grand unveiling, at least in recent times. Planned to be held at San Francisco’s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which seats 7,000 people – meaning it’ll be their grandest yet, leading many to believe there will be a lot to be talked about. We’re likely to see the internal upgrades of the  iPhone 6s  and the  iPhone 6s Plus , coming from the Cupertino natives. Subsequently, there’s a possibility that a fresh iPad and Apple TV might make an appearance during the event. Apple’s take on an iOS 9, OS X El Capitan and watchOS 2 are also stated to be released during the time. Word floating around goes to say that the displays on the new iPhones will sport the innovative Force Touch function. If you’ve haven’t heard of Force Touch, it’s basically a pressure-sensitive technology that enables users to access extended functions – that’s been available on the Apple Watch and their latest line of MacBooks. Do we think it’s absolutely necessary to have Force Touch on board? It’ll be negligible at best, with increased accessibility to functions; widgets, maybe? Nonetheless, Apple’s “innovation” has always been “revolutionary” like Siri (which people ended up forgetting about), so we’ll see if there’s anything to shout about while having this feature incorporated in the Retina Display of the new iPhones. Other hardware upgrades should also bring about 2GB of RAM, a new A9 processor chip, and a camera optics bump to 12-megapixels. In recent times, Apple has gradually slowed its ability to innovate, or at least innovate something that’s game-changing. A worrying trend that’s been faced by other manufacturers, as well. That aside, iOS 9’s features, has already been previewed in June and it’ll come in just a 1.3 GB package. This is a great improvement since iOS 8 required at least 5GB’s to unpack. A little late to the party, but the new OS will allow users to take advantage of iDevices with larger displays through multi-window. Other nifty improvements can be seen  here . Fortunately, Chinese tech site cnBeta gives us something to look at (since the device will look the same) with the purported packaging images. What you’re looking at is a stupendously pretty Butterfly Koi image on the said device. Rumours say that this image could be the similar motion wallpaper previously available for the Apple Watch. Will the “s” in the “6s” compel more people to jump aboard the Apple ship? We’ll have to wait to see the reactions following the September 9 th  event; watch the livestream  here  at 1 am (GMT +8/local time) on the aforementioned date. [  SOURCE  ]"

After  revamping its postpaid offering  with probably the most generous serving of data, they have upgraded its P70 plan that could please most chatterboxes. Dubbed as the U Mobile “Hero” postpaid plan, this is likely a response to MaxisONE plan that has been thumping on unlimited calls and SMS. For just RM70/month, the P70 comes with unlimited free calls to all networks in Malaysia and on top of that, you still get the same 7GB of data which was upgraded from just 4.5GB previously. According to the  FAQ , the upgraded unlimited calls and 7GB of data are offered on a permanent basis, so you can enjoy this until you switch plans or when you port out. For SMS, it is still chargeable but at a low 3 sen/SMS within U Mobile and 8 sen/SMS to other networks.  Can’t finish 7GB in one account? You are able to share this with up to 2 more SIM Cards with its supplementary  member line  at RM10/month each. This is probably the best all you can eat postpaid offering right now unless you’re still into good old SMS. As comparison, the  new MaxisONE plan  starts from RM98/month and it offers unlimited calls and SMS but it comes with just 1GB of data. Additional data costs an incremental RM30 for every 2GB extra. If you’re an existing U Mobile P70 subscriber, the plan will be upgraded automatically and they won’t charge any fees to make the switch.  For clarity of its unlimited call usage, according to U Mobile’s fair use policy, this covers all domestic calls within Malaysia excluding those premium numbers (e.g. 1300/1500/103). They reserve to the right to suspend the line if it is being abused for call centre usage, sim boxing and keeping the line on for hours.  For more info, head over to U Mobile’s  postpaid page ."
Arif Lee,Samsung Gear S2 is officially revealed with a round face.

Boasting an IP68 rating (waterproof) and to come in 3 models: the  Gear S2 , Gear S2 classic and the Gear S2 3G, it’ll be the first round faced watch from Samsung. Offering the two visually different models to a different crowd – Gear S2 towards the sportier, always running about user, while the classic version will be for individuals who much rather have a timeless watch face design. The former will be attached to the silicon band, available in either a dark grey case + black band or a silver case + white band combination. Then we’ll see a black case donning the leather black band, on the Gear S2 classic. All three variants share the latest Tizen OS, seen on previous iterations of Samsung wearables, with only the inception of the rotating bezel screen changing the game for the Korean outfit. Specs internally will feature a 1GHz dual-core processor, mated to 512MB of RAM on the 1.2-inch Super AMOLED housed device. Resolution stands at 360 x 360 with a 302ppi and it’ll have 4GB of internal memory on board the 11.4mm thin frame. You’ll connect to the internet through Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n and pair with other devices through Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC. Assuming you’re picking up the Gear S2 with 3G capabilities you’ll have an e-SIM slot available at your disposal. All three models come in the same 11.4mm but differ slightly in dimensions and battery size. The regular Samsung Gear S2 measures at 42.3 x 49.8 x 11.4mm at 47 grams, while the classic model is slimmed down to reflect a more elegant look – 39.9 x 43.6 x 11.4mm at 42 grams. They both share a 250mAh battery, supposedly will last up to 2-3 days of normal use. Being a 3G model, the 2 day rated Gear S2 e-SIM enabled smart watch will run on a slightly larger 300 mAh battery, bulking the device a bit – 44.0 x 51.8 x 13.4mm and tipping the scales at 51 grams. There’s no pricing yet but we’ll see that during IFA in Berlin. So does it make sense to pick up a wearable like this? It’s great that they’ve added two different models appealing to a different crowd, matching a more traditional round watch-face and an innovative rotating bezel for manoeuvring through its OS. It also beats the  Apple Watch  in battery life, which only has 18 hours but it still leaves us asking for more – perhaps battery technology has to catch up to our power-hungry needs. It still leaves us to this question – will you buy it? [  SOURCE  ]"

A headache causing model line-up, that in the past has already been quite a mouthful. Sharing the same 13-megapixel sensor for its rear and front cameras; same goes for the dual-LED (Real Tone), while the laser auto focus makes its way only on the rear camera. Making this device, surely to be a pocket friendly point and shoot; though we haven’t had time to thoroughly test out the camera. Selling as a selfie centric device, ASUS has included some camera centered software features to let users take charge of their photography. You’ll see everything on a ZenUI overlay of Android 5.0, that as it is, quite heavily skinned. Adding to an existing slew of addware, the Zenfone Selfie has ZenMotion – a feature that lets you draw an “S” on the screen to open the front facing camera to snap your selfies. As more Zenfone models become a norm, it’ll be harder to differentiate their devices – at least in terms of aesthetics. Similarly, the Zenfone Selfie looks much alike the Zenfone 2, on the surface for the most part. Internally, it differs by being equip with a 64-bit Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, mated to 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory that’s expandable. The 5.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) device has its glass bolstered thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and supports Dual-SIM LTE networks for cellular connectivity. Battery-wise, it be powered by a removable 3000 mAh battery, that somewhat mediates the problem of lacking ASUS Boostmaster quick charging. Priced at RM 1,049 (w/ GST), the Zenfone Selfie will be available in 3 colour options: white, pink or blue and potential buyers can expect the device to go on sale sometime this week. Below are the  Zenfone 2  on the left and the Zenfone Selfie on the right. As you can see, although both share the same screen size at 5.5-inch, the Zenfone Selfie is indeed longer; mainly the camera making up the difference."

Samsung  has hastily responded to the issue by simply saying: To sum it up, there’s no solution to the problem – cause it technically shouldn’t be an issue in the first place. By chance this does happen, you probably weren’t paying attention to your four figure device in the first place; sheer negligence on your part. Logically with the way you would handle the stylus, it’d make sense that after fiddling with it you’d put it in nib pointed first, otherwise it’d just be going against the natural way of things; then again, accidents do happen. The Korean company does warn you about this but chances are you skipped user manual for the most part. Owners can head over to page 25 on the user manual to read the details on the S Pen insertion. Ideally, it’s a two way street when concerning this issue, as Samsung could have probably designed the stylus in a way that it can’t possibly slide in backwards by accident.

Alexander Wong,Honor 7 First Impressions: Get more without busting your budget,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/honor-7-first-impressions-get-more-without-busting-your-budget/,,,2015-08-28,"High performance and low price. That’s the name of the game with these online driven brands. Before the rise of Xiaomi in international markets, Huawei claims to be in the forefront of e-commerce with its honor smart phone line up. Although both Huawei and honor share the same roots, they are distinctively different in terms of positioning and for us consumers, the price tag makes a whole world of difference. During today’s event, “honor” was emphasised as a brand for the new generation and for those who are young at heart. Being a digital-native driven product, it goes directly to consumers, cutting out the middle man which results lower cost and a more competitive price tag. Last year, the honor 6 stood out as one of our favourite 4G LTE smart phones under RM1,000. With its in-house developed Kirin processor, it performed just as good as a flagship Galaxy S5 and yet it cost half the price of other similar flagship devices. For 2015, the new honor flagship isn’t just an improvement but it aims to move the goal post further. The honor 7 gets a slightly bigger 5.2” Full HD display encased in an all metal unibody design. It feels much better than the honor 6 which felt plasticky. The front looks virtually the same as the honor 6 but you’ll notice the changes as you turn to the sides.  The back has a nice curve which makes it comfortable to hold, while the top and bottom ends have a plastic cover with some nice texture to it. You’ll find a large camera lens which protrudes slightly but you need not to worry about scratches as it uses sapphire glass. Also prominent is a new fingerprint scanner that’s quite similar to the Ascend Mate 7.  On the right, you’ll find your usual power and volume rockers, while the left houses a SIM tray slot and a new Smart Key. At the top, it is no surprise with a typical headphone jack, a secondary mic as well as an infrared blaster. Looking at the bottom, it gets a pair of speaker and microphone grills on each side of the microUSB port, which is much better than the old one having the speaker placed at the back."

We saw it first from  @evleaks  who replied to a tweet saying the HTC A9 (Aero) is to be out by Q4 of this year. Now we get to see fresh glimpses of the said device thanks to a leak in China. Struggling to stay afloat, the Taiwanese company is trying to redeem itself, since its less than stellar sales of its flagship smartphone. Sharing an uncanny resemblance to an iPhone from the back; only differing in terms of camera placement, this could mean HTC has lost all luster in the design department. We’ve seen it before with the M9, M8 and M7 – all sharing the same aesthetic appeal. Taking a look at the front, the huge HTC logo stays in place at the bottom being closely followed by the bottom Boomsound speaker, while topside there’s nothing much we can tell from the blurry photo, other than the top Boomsound speaker and a front-facing camera. Internally, the device purported will carry a QHD screen with Gorilla Glass 4 protecting it from scratches and smudges. The HTC A9 will have 2.5 D curved edges to help its ergonomics and come equip with a f/1.9 rear camera lens to handle those dim environments. Seems like there’s much more that’s yet to be leaked about this HTC smart phone but its rumoured to be announced in October and be on sale in some markets come November. [  SOURCE ,  2 ,  VIA  ]"

Almost a year after the release of its  honor 6  in Malaysia, the new successor steps up with a premium build and enhanced features to close the gap with its flagship rivals. For those who are unfamiliar, Honor is Huawei’s sub-brand that’s digitally driven through its Vmall online stores. In China, the honor 7 did tremendously well with 200,000 sold online in just 2 minutes.  To recap, the honor 7 is slightly larger at 5.2 inches and the IPS-Neo display pushes a Full HD resolution of 1920×1080. Under the hood is an updated 64-bit Octa-Core (4X 1.5GHz + 4X 2.2GHz) Kirin 935 processor that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. For the international market, it gets 16GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB. The overall build of the honor 7 is pretty solid with its unibody metal back that comes with a slight curve for a more comfortable grip. On the right, it gets a power button in the middle and a volume rocker right next to it. On the left side, you’ll find a Smart Key button which can be customised to your reference and a SIM tray slot that supports dual-SIMs.  The main speaker and microphones are placed at the bottom alongside its microUSB port, while the top comes with the standard headphone jack and an infrared blaster.   For photography, the honor 7 gets a much larger 20MP IMX230 sensor from Sony and a f/2.0 aperture lens. The new sensor comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus which provides an ultra-quick focusing time of 0.1 seconds. While the camera lens has a protruding bump, it uses sapphire glass to protect it from scratches. In terms of features, it supports a wide range of filters, slow-mo, time lapse and even light painting, a key feature that was introduced with the  Huawei P8  flagship. At the front, it gets an 8MP f/2.4 shooter with soft flash. Over at the back, the honor 7 also gets a fingerprint scanner which unlocks instantly on a single touch. Like the Huawei P8, it also supports knuckle sense, allowing you to double tap using your knuckle to take a screenshot but at the same time, it still supports the standard double tap to wake while the screen is switched off.  Keeping the lights on is an embedded 3,100mAh battery and it also support quick charge which does 0-50% in 30 minutes. Overall the honor 7 weighs 157 grams and has a thickness of 8.5mm. Out of the box, it runs on EMUI 3.1 that’s based on Android 5.0 Lollipop.  The honor 7 is expected to come to Malaysia officially in September. In China, the dual-SIM 4G LTE variant with 16GB is  priced  at 2,199CNY which is about RM1,436. Meanwhile in the UK where the device is being launched, the honor 7 is priced at £249.99 (about RM1,611). We should be getting some price indication closer to local launch.

The returns were minimal, although achieving sales through the high end Moto X, and lower end Moto G and Moto E. Lenovo decided that their portfolio was better suited if they capitalised on buying Moto’s presence in the Western market, giving them a better chance worldwide. Almost a year on, they’ve now decided to sell solely under the Motorola name, dissolving its Lenovo Mobile branding. A merging will see all future phones to be sold under the Motorola name, solving the problem of managing two separate companies, who sell the same type of product. In theory, both companies gain as Motorola has always had an issue with only having a limited model inventory, at least presently. Lenovo tops out in terms of its marketability, for the markets they’re not well known yet. All of this is speculation, for the most part – as no official English press release has been outed. So what happens to the latest Lenovo Vibe Shot and the Lenovo Vibe S1? It’ll likely be Lenovo’s last offerings, to match Motorola’s conspicuous design or could we see a more varied aesthetic language from the future Motorola devices? Back to the lack of worldwide mention on the subject; based on the lack of information coming from Lenovo, instead only coming from Xiaomi Times – we hope all customers take this information with a grain of salt.

So does printing a disclaimer save them from the backlash? As far as we’re concerned, when you fork out RM 2,699 for a phablet, you’re expecting something that has stood up to vigorous testing. How far along were they before they finally realised? Was putting up that 25 th  page in the user manual adequate? What actually causes the S Pen functionality to go bust? We aren’t entirely sure about the first two questions but we’ll help answer the third in this article. Blessed to have the guys from  9to5google  and  uBreakiFix  who’ve dived into this whole mess by showing what it looks like on the inside of the Note5 when the S Pen inserted the wrong way. Looking closer at the photo, you’ll see levers that jut out in the silo: one controls S Pen detection and functionality, while the other secures the stylus from falling out the silo. The former/lever 1 sits in between the middle and the end of the silo, under the primary logic board angled upwards on the right of the S Pen; without this lever, you’ll lose two features – Screen-off memo and Air Command. However, lever 1 doesn’t cause the S Pen to get stuck – that’s caused by lever 2. Located a little further up the silo, towards the end is the lever that will be the doom of your stylus. An intricate writing tool of sorts, it’s designed to have two small cutouts near the writing end that holds it in firmly when slotted correctly, writing tip first. A positive design but here’s the deal – if it’s placed backwards or click side first, you’ll see it getting hitched after passing the second lever. Once you’re in this deep, you’re probably not getting it out, considering the lack of space following this mishap. If you’re lucky enough to get the backward S Pen passed the second lever, you’re gonna have to get past the first lever again. Removing the Samsung stylus after this could likely damage the other plastic lever that’s mounted inside an internal part soldered to the main board. Thin in nature, this plastic lever gives you the S Pen detection capability, thus making you disable S Pen Detection to get the stylus to work (that is if you’ve managed to get it out in the first place) – killing the two aforementioned features, delivering a bleak Note5 writing experience. Sympathising with current and future owners of the Galaxy Note5, all we can do is advise everyone to avoid this scenario (as unrealistic as it is) and don’t try to replicate this problem at all, you’ll regret even trying to do so.

Arif Lee,First solid rollable keyboard comes to life: the LG Rolly,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/28/first-solid-rollable-keyboard-comes-to-life-the-lg-rolly/,"LG,LG Rolly Keyboard,portable keyboard,Rolly Keyboard","Cool stuff,LG,Mobile Accessories,Others",2015-08-28,"Announced as the “industry’s first solid rollable wireless portable keyboard”, the  LG  Rolly is made for people on their tablets and smartphones who need to type out a wordy document or quickly reply to conversations on instant messaging apps. We’ve seen a lot of flexible keyboards in the past but being made out of silicon, they were flimsy at best. The LG Rolly keyboard tackles that by existing in an “impact-resistant” polycarbonate with ABS plastic – potentially increasing the experience of the tactile feedback. Roll it/fold it and turn it into a slim cuboid shape to carry around, increasing portability without sacrificing too much on the typing feedback. It’ll connect to your favoured device through Bluetooth 3.0 and can be paired to two devices at the same time and has an in-built stand (limited to tablets not more than 10 inches). LG probably took some cues from  Logitech K480 , which has the same two previously mentioned features but loses out to the Logitech’s ability to switch between 3 devices, not just 2. Though, you’re likely to prefer the rollability of the LG Rolly more, if it’ll be joining you on the daily. For a device powered by a single AAA battery, it’ll provide enough juice to last you 3 months – as quoted by LG. Scheduled to make an appearance during IFA 2015 in September, we’re hoping to see this thing in action and if it’s all it’s made to be. There’s no word on pricing and availability for now but you’d probably find out early next month. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Speculated to take place in the city that never sleeps, Microsoft could pull back the curtains on its latest update to the 2-in-1 convertible, along with its latest iterations of Lumias. Other than the phones and convertible being released, we might also see the latest Microsoft Band 2, which is supposed to be launched as well. Running a slimmer version of Windows 10, with the Mobile version, the Cityman (940 XL) and Talkman (940) will join other  Lumias  that are to run the mobile OS. The smaller of the latest two Lumia phones, will sit at a 5.2-inch sized screen and feature a Hexa-core Snapdragon 808 SoC for processing. Otherwise, the smaller sibling is as similar to its big brother, the 940 XL – a 5.7-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) screen and the infamous Snapdragon 810 powering the way, mated with 3GB of RAM to ease multiple tasks. Lots of pixels, power and multitasking that comes together with 32GB internal memory, that is expandable with a MicroSD card. Camera internals were leaked awhile back, and the larger 940 XL apparently carries a 20-megapixel PureView camera on the rear, while a 5-megapixel snapper meets the front. Rumours also go on to state that both devices will come equip with an iris scanner for biometric security and a USB Type-C port for charging/data transfers. A much needed revive could see the Lumias attempt to make an impact in the smart phone department, at least for now we know what the device could live up to be. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The  Galaxy Note5  will be launched officially in Malaysia next Thursday. The Galaxy Note 5 retains a similar 5.7″ Quad HD display but it now comes in a premium all glass and metal design similar to its S6/S6 edge series. Under the hood, it gets a top of the line Exynos Octa-Core processor with a massive 4GB of RAM for all your multi-tasking needs. For the busy man on the go, the new Note5 will come with dual-SIMs allowing you to stay connected on 2 different telcos. With the launch happening on a Thursday, we expect Samsung Malaysia to make the devices available almost immediately across all retail channels including its big 3 telcos. Also to make its official debut in Malaysia, is the S6 edge+, its phablet version of its double curve display smart phone. So far Celcom has  started teasing  that the Note5 and S6 edge+ will be coming on their network. In terms of price, do expect to  pay a lot more . Not only it is priced higher than the Note 4 due to GST, but we would probably need to factor our  current exchange rate  of RM4.24 to 1 USD. Any guesses for the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ price tag?

Available with Dual-SIM and 4G LTE support, both models are available for pre-order from 11street until 31st August. During the pre-order period, the first 200 customers will be entitled to get extra freebies, either the SmartBand SWR10 or Sony Speaker SRS-BTV5 that are worth more than RM250. On top of that, you can stand a chance to win an Xperia C5 Ultra Dual by participating the contest on 11street Facebook page. To be among the first to get it in Malaysia, you can also join Sony Mobile Malaysia’s LINE official account and answer a simple question to win a brand new Xperia C5 Ultra Dual or Xperia M5 Dual.    Shortly after announcing the Xperia C4, the Xperia C5 Ultra is the bigger successor with a phablet sized 6″ Full HD display and it comes with 13MP cameras on both sides. In terms of specs, it retains the same 1.7GHz MediaTek Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM and it also comes with 16GB of storage. Fortunately there’s room for more with its microSD expansion slot. Going back to the camera, the Xperia C5 Ultra takes its PRO Selfie feature up a notch with a wider 22mm view and a soft-LED flash light at the front. Despite its larger display, the Xperia C5 Ultra gets a near-borderless display which makes it more usable in a single hand. Powering the Xperia C5 Ultra is a 2,930mAh capacity battery that’s rated to last up to 2 days. It is officially priced at RM1,399 and comes with a choice of White, Black and Mint colours.  The Xperia M5 is a compact waterproof device with high-end aspirations. It gets a 5″ Full HD display and under the hood you’ll find a 2.0GHz Octa-Core MediaTek Helo X10 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board it gets 16GB of storage that also comes with an expandable microSD slot. The front 13MP camera is similar with the Xperia C5 Ultra but the back gets an updated 21.5MP Sony IMX230 sensor that supports Phase Detection Auto Focus. With this, you can capture moving objects in greater clarity thanks to its 0.25 seconds focus time.  To maintain its slender 7.6mm side profile, the Xperia M5 comes with a 2,600mAh capacity battery but it is also claims to push up to 2 days of battery life.

Revamping the former and making the latter bigger but keeping the insides relatively the same; Samsung’s two updates will seek to cater to the market’s attraction towards bigger screened mobile phones. The latest Galaxy Note5 will set you back a cool RM 2,699 (w/ GST), while the bigger S6 edge+ will cost RM 3,099 (w/ GST). Both of the aforementioned devices will go on sale from the 4 th  of September onwards; the former will come in two colour options – Gold Platinum or White Pearl, as the latter will be available in either Gold Platinum or Black Sapphire. They are essentially hitting the market next Friday so be sure to check out any promotional materials from telco companies soon. Envisioning a market space that grew thanks to its humble beginnings with the Note series, the Galaxy Note5 is promised to be a worthy 5 th  year edition. Focused towards users who want to be more productive and have a larger screen real-estate, the S Pen will attempt to be an amazing writing companion. Designed to help people with its writing capabilities through the pen computing of the renowned S Pen, it’ll enable you to jot information down quickly with Screen-off Memo. Scroll capture is a great new edition to the S Pen’s features – allowing you to screen capture up to 22 pages for easy reference of conversation history or GPS directions while driving. We’ve talked about the Note5’s specs before but just to refresh your memory, this is a 5.7-inch QHD (2560 × 1440) screen device that runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. It’ll be powerfully equipped with an Exynos 7420 processor that’s clocked at 2.1 GHz, mated with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Internal storage options currently only stand at 32GB but we’re sure bigger versions will make their way to out market soon. Weighing in at 171g, this device has a rear 16-megapixel camera sensor and a 5-megapixel camera sported on the front (both at f/1.9 aperture). Powering this phablet is a 3,000 mAh non-removable battery – surely disappointing fans of the old Note(s) that always had a battery that was hot-swappable. The same goes for the MicroSD slot, that used to live on the Note 4 and its predecessors but has been omitted from the newest Note5. Don’t be too disappointed though, as you’ll be pleased to know that the LTE capable device now has Dual-SIM support on board, allowing dual-wielding phone users to minimise the number of phones they need to carry. The other star of the show, is the Galaxy S6 edge+, and while it only differs in terms of the availability of the S Pen, the dual edged display and its aesthetic value, has the same specs as the Note5. Succeeding its smaller sibling in a big way, the 5.7-inch screen is larger to increase visibility, and improve its hardiness, with a tougher 7000 series aluminium – stronger than the S6 edge. Since we’re 10 days away, let us know what you think of the device so far and to recap our coverage of Samsung Unpacked you can check it out  here ."

Other new additions include two new emojis – the spock hand sign emoji and the always appropriate middle finger. Feature-wise, they’ve also added the option to mute contacts individually, which in the past you could only do with group chats. Marking chats as read or unread are enabled too, making double tick excuses no longer necessary.

Full instructions after the break. The self-proclaimed  2016 Flagship killer  is getting its first OxygenOS software update that aims to quash teething problems after its global debut. Just to recap, the OnePlus 2 comes in 2 flavours – HydrogenOS for the Chinese market and OxygenOS for international users.   The OTA update weighs 1.1GB and it will be rolled out first in India before it trickles down to the rest of the world.  As you would expect, the latest update fixes the critical Stagefright issues and it addresses other stability and performance concerns on the new device. The changelog reads as follows: 1. Download the latest Oxygen OS ROM or update file (if you’re currently running on Oxygen OS 2.0.0) 2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and copy the file to the root folder 
3. Switch off your phone 
4. Press and hold the (Volume Down) and (Power Button) Together until the phone starts 
5. Select English 
6. Select Install Upgrade File from SD 
7. Select the file that you’ve copied and click OK 
8. Reboot after upgrade is completed.  You can read the full upgrade details  here . ============ If you’ve followed our  Twitter  and  Facebook feed , we shared that the OnePlus 2’s battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Despite having a massive 3,300mAh capacity battery, we managed to do an average of 17-19 hours on a single charge with 4 hours of screen on time. At that’s on a very light usage with no GPS disabled. Considering the OnePlus is still on a Full HD 1080p display resolution, that’s quite short compared to other flagship smart phones with higher Quad HD screens and smaller batteries. So far no issues on performance and we liked the stock-like nature of OxygenOS which feels very fluid. One of such bugs we’ve spotted is the Google Photos app. When you try to pinch and zoom, it automatically springs back to 100% width view and this is annoying. We ended up installing QuickPic viewing instead. At time of writing, the OxygenOS 2.0.1 update isn’t available on our unit yet and hopefully this would fix the problems we encountered so far.

If you’ve purchased the said device and its serial number falls within the range that was affected, Apple will replace your iSight camera on the iPhone 6 Plus for free. Those eligible have to ensure they meet two prerequisites: their device matches the range of serial numbers and your phone is taking blurry shots with its rear camera. Here’s how to find your iPhone 6 Plus’ serial number for Apple’s iSight Replacement Program: After finding out your serial number through the method above, head on over  here  and simply key in your serial number to check if it’s eligible. Once you’ve checked its eligibility, you can drop off your problematic iPhone at any participating  Apple Authorized Service Providers . They’ll verify your eligibility and examine if your device is in working order. Below are some locations in Kuala Lumpur where you can drop your iPhone 6 Plus. Before you pass your smart phone over to anyone, make sure you  back up your data  on iTunes or iCloud to make sure there’s no data lost during the repair; do consider wiping your device clean after backing up your infomation to avoid any embarrassing photo scandals and protect any sensitive data – don’t worry, you’ll be able to restore everything from the data back up that you did earlier once you get your repaired iDevice back. Apple also hands a wary disclaimer, saying that if any components are damaged prior that might impair camera replacement, it’ll have to be resolved first before they can continue; some cases there will be cost incurred, given another component is preventing camera replacement (e.g. cracked screen) Worth mentioning that Apple might ask you to get your iPhone 6 Plus repaired by its country of origin; the replacement program doesn’t extend the warranty coverage of your iPhone. Be sure to get your device fixed quickly, if it’s eligible, as the program duration only last for 3 years after the first retail unit was sold (September 2014). In the past, Apple has faced qualms with its iPhone 5’s  battery  and  sleep/wake button , proving that even with high industry standards, premium products and all that jazz, you’re just as likely to produce products with faults. At least they’re open about the said issues and willing to make sure that their products are of a high standards by conducting these programs. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The camera sensor itself will be a Sony 13-megapixel BSI sensor with a f/2.0 aperture lens.   Notwithstanding its regular smart phone features, the Honor 7i also comes with a fingerprint sensor, placed at its side. Claiming to be the smallest said sensor on any phone, the Honor 7i embraces cues from the  Saygus V SQUARED  – this same fingerprint sensor can also allow you to take photos using your thumb on the Honor 7i. Not short on similarities, the swivelling camera concept has also been on the  OPPO N3  and the  Doov Nike V1  for quite some time. Glass sandwiches the aluminum frame of the 5.2-inch 1080p display device, while internally it’ll pack the latest Snapdragon 616, mated with two configurations for memory: 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage or 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. It’ll come with Huawei’s EMUI 3.1 out of the box and be powered by a 3000 mAh battery. The Honor brand will soon release and market the Honor 7 internationally, so this could mean the same applies for the Honor 7i in the near future, however grey importers should find no trouble in bringing in the new phone, as they normally do. The device sells for ¥ 1,899.00 in China, roughly RM 1242 after conversion. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Tethered on a retractable leash similar to those used with dogs, it solves the problem of your quadcopter going rogue. The Phi aim is to simplify drone flying and make it easy for the average consumer to use with minimal training required. Extending up to 26 feet and having the ability to attach a GoPro to the kite-drone, one can only imagine the possibilities of aerial photography. Being funded through the crowd-funding platform, Indiegogo, the Phi (drone only, no GoPro) is available for pre-order for $249 USD / RM 1027 (now $289 USD / RM 1191) and will ship sometime in Q1 2016. Not a stranger to the drone world, Fotokite previously developed and launched the Fotokite Pro, that has made itself a regular in news organisations like the BBC. Handing tools to potential citizen journalists around the world, the Fotokite Phi is set to enable access to harmful protests zones or provide a less worrisome experience in a large open spaced area. Flight is propelled by 4 low-torqued plastic blades shielded by guards to decrease chances of injury, if one were to come in contact with the flying robot. The aforementioned inspiration behind the creation of the Fotokite was Lupashin’s observations during protests stemming, due to the suspicious federal election that took place in Russia back in 2011. Thankfully, some of these occurrences were captured by drone photographers who were in the area, which gave us a good look at how the Russian people were reacting. Hence, it proved that drone journalism would be pivotal but the only obstacle would be the necessary knowledge to fly a drone in crowded areas – that’s where the innovative leash system would come in. Making use of the same technology in retractable dog leashes, Lupashin excluding the need of a well-versed drone pilot. Tethered in such a manner whereby the leash line sits just below the provided GoPro slot, it’ll ensure that the lens always stays pointed towards the individual manning the drone. Weighing only 12 ounces / 341 grams (including the battery and camera) the Fotokite Phi can fold itself to maximise space and is kept away in its packing tube. Twist gestures command the device to start-up and turning min-flight is manipulated by a button click and similar flick of the wrist, while the leash can be slacked to provide a wider viewing area for stills and video. If you’re in the market for something a little higher end, you can look at the Fotokite Pro – mainly the same as its more affordable sibling (15 minutes fly-time) except for the tether doubling as a power cable and a downlink transfer for uncompressed HD video, providing longer recording and flight-times. Do check out their  IndieGoGo  and their page  here  if you want to get your hands on this amazing drone. [  SOURCE  ]"

We liked the compact design, its full HD display and 13MP camera. However its performance leave a lot to be desired. Now it appears that Xiaomi is trying to fix this with a newer model that’s expected to be called the Mi 4c. As shown above in its TEENA certification, the Mi 4c is identical to the Mi 4i but it runs on a higher-spec Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor.  The Mi 4i is only sold internationally outside of China and it was jokingly called “Mi 4 India” during its  launch . Perhaps the Mi 4c could stand for Mi 4 China. If the  TEENA certification  isn’t convincing enough, the Mi 4c has also dropped by  Geekbench  and  Antutu  benchmarks, revealing some of its specs and some pre-release performance figures.  The front is still having a 5″ Full HD 1920×1080 display but underneath it runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 808 processor, which is the same processor powering the  LG G4  flagship. The Mi 4c still gets 2GB of RAM and storage starts from 16GB just like the Mi 4i. For imaging, it retains the same 13MP + 5MP camera combination and the battery is said to be a similar 3,100mAh unit. As a new device, it should be running on  MIUI 7  that’s based on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop. Interestingly its TEENA certification reveals an Infrared Blaster and this allows you to use the device as a universal remote control. Their recently announced  Redmi Note 2  also comes with one as well. With a faster processor, hopefully the Mi 4c can solve the shortcomings of the Mi 4i. The price shouldn’t be far off from their current Mi 4i as anything higher is encroaching into the  ASUS Zenfone 2  space that packs more RAM and storage. At the moment, the Mi 4i is priced at RM749 for 16GB and  RM889 for the 32GB  version.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The  OPPO R5  which is their thinnest smart phone at a mere 4.85mm has returned for a sequel in the form of the OPPO R5s. Nothing has changed in terms of design but it gets a new grey colour scheme that looks pretty slick. Under the hood, it gets some welcomed upgrades – a larger 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage. As comparison, the current OPPO R5 has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Like the original R5, storage isn’t expandable with microSD.   The rest of the spec-sheet is the same as before with a 5.2″ Super AMOLED display that does full HD 1080p and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor. Unfortunately the embedded battery is the same paltry 2,000mAh unit but it can be replenished quickly with VOOC Flash charger from 0 to 75% in 30 minutes. The camera is still the same 13MP Sony IMX214 unit at the back with a front facing 5MP selfie shooter. Out of the box, it still runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat that has ColorOS 2.0 running on top. Just like the original R5, the R5s also lacks a headphone jack and you’ll need a micro-USB to audio adapter if you’re planning to plug in your head phones.  The price of the OPPO R5s is quite surprising as it was listed at 199 Euros (about RM947). As comparison, the OPPO R5 in Malaysia is  currently priced  at RM1,398, down from RM1,598 previously. For the specs, this is quite compelling for under RM1,000 but if only it has a bigger battery on-board.  [  SOURCE  ,  VIA  ]"

To recap on the specs, both the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ share the same internals with a 5.7″ Quad HD display and their 14nm based Exynos Octa-Core processor mated with 4GB of RAM. What separates the two is that the Note 5 comes with a new improved S-Pen while the S6 edge+ gets a dual-curve display with a couple of new edge features.

When the best is simply not enough, they have just announced an even better Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition which comes with an enormous 256GB of storage.

If this holds water, two big German carriers have been rumoured to prep their own grand launch of the said iPhone(s). Comparable to the United States, the Germans have also been lucky to one of the first few to get their hands on the much beloved Apple mobile device. Since Apple puts Malaysia as low priority, expect a few months wait for its official release.

With the inclusion of a heart rate sensor, you get more details out of your workout which includes your heart rate, stress and relaxation levels. By default it comes in either black or white straps which can be customised with their optional colourful straps.  To ensure its usability in any situations, the SmartBand 2 gets a rather high IP68 waterproof rating.

However Samsung is taking the round approach to a whole new level with its rotating bezel ring as opposed to a digital crown that’s being used on the Apple Watch. To get a taste of what to expect, they have finally released the teaser video which was first shown during last week’s event and it revolves around the circular interface.  In terms of design, Samsung has toned down its gadgetry look, opting for a normal watch appearance. With Apple pushing the Watch as a fashion piece, Samsung is expected to follow suit by offering an array of build materials and strap designs. You can view some lifestyle shots of the Gear S2 over  here .  One of the pet peeves of having a circular watch is the impracticality of the display versus a square display that gives a more usable space for reading.

With internet becoming the core of smart phone usage, the folks of Maxis has finally updated its MaxisONE Plan offering with more data than before, and it hopes to be the “one” plan to suit everyone.  Similar to its previous offering, the MaxisONE Plan offers unlimited calls and SMS to any local numbers and should you exceed your allocated internet quota, there won’t be any excess charges but your speeds will be throttled down until you top up for more. If you use WhatsApp and Facebook, the new plan offers unlimited social chat usage  and this will not consume your monthly data quota  which utilises your quota but it is still usable after you’ve hit your quota limit.  For music lovers, streaming Spotify will be offered permanently for free and you can stream all you want without worrying about data quota and incurring streaming costs. On top of that, Spotify Premium is worth RM14.99 is bundled for free on the all new MaxisONE plans.  Before this, there were 3 plans – MaxisONE Plan, MaxisONE Plan Lite and  MaxisOne Start . The MaxisONE Plan at RM128/month was previously the only option that offers true unlimited calls to any network while the cheaper MaxisOne Lite and MaxisOne Start were limited only to numbers within the Maxis/Hotlink Network. To simplify things, all new MaxisONE Plans now offers unlimited calls and SMS to any local number across the board and the only difference is the bundled data that you’ll need. There are total of 4 plans available that are named after its monthly commitment fee – MaxisONE Plan 98, MaxisONE Plan 128, MaxisONE Plan 158 and MaxisONE Plan 188. With that, the minimum option is now priced slightly higher at RM98/month and it comes with 1GB of data bundled in. The next option is the MaxisONE Plan 128 which comes with 3GB of data. This is an extra 1GB for the same price that was offered previously. If you need 3GB, it used to cost RM158/month with the RM30/month extra data add-on. Have a bigger data appetite? There’s the MaxisONE Plan 158 with 5GB and MaxisONE Plan 188 at 7GB. Basically you’re paying RM15/GB extra for each step above the base MaxisONE Plan 98 plan. As a promo, those who subscribed for MaxisONE Plan 188 will get 1GB extra for 6 months, giving you a total of 8GB/month.  Should you need more data, it will cost you 200MB for RM10, 500MB for RM20 and 1GB for RM30. That’s still quite expensive and if you know your usage patterns well, it is better to opt for a higher MaxisONE Plan option in the long run.  For more info, head over to the  MaxisONE Plan page ."

From the photos you can tell quite a decent amount about the phone and it even has something that looks like an additional front camera sensor. However, @upleaks states that the Vibe S1 will indeed have dual-front facing cameras. HTC is not foreign to this concept, barring the differing placements (rear instead of front), with its Duo Camera technology but this could possibly be the first front facing dual camera set up in the world. Users who love bokeh effects might consider adding that extra touch to their selfie photos, seemingly the only plus point of having two shutters up front. Having said that, other internals include a 5-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen, that’s functioning thanks to an Octa-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 615 processor. There will be 2GB of RAM and just 16GB of internal memory to take advantage of on the Vibe S1 but it does come with MicroSD expansion. Optics will be supported by a 13-megapixel rear snapper and a (at least one) 8-megapixel front sensor for those selfies. The device will also come with LTE but there’s no mention of the Android version it’ll run when it goes on sale. Please note that the information above are leaks, so its authenticity is questionable.

Not only you’re tied for 24 months but you would also need to fork out a huge sum of money upfront, which sometimes cost more in total than the actual phone itself. While there are some telcos offering zero waiver for upfront payments, you’re essentially still tied down to the same phone until your 24 months duration is up.  Maxis wants to change the way you buy your smart phones by introducing the Zerolution program. It promises absolutely no payment upfront, no contracts and no interest fee over your monthly payments. Best of all, this isn’t an Easy Payment Plan that requires a credit card. Everything you hate about a phone contract be gone. Sounds too good to be true? Read on to find out.  To get a phone through Zerolution, you’ll need to pick a new  MaxisONE Plan  that starts from RM98/month and then pick the phone you want. By default, the monthly payment is calculated over a 24 months period and if you decide to leave, you’ll just need to pay the balance without any penalty charges. For those that want to own the latest phones every year, there’s an early upgrade option at RM30/month. So after 12 months, you can surrender your current device and switch to a newer phone without any penalty or upgrade cost. Just pick a new phone and pay the new monthly payment.  In order to upgrade, the device must be in good working order which means no cracked screen or serious dents on the device. If the device is not in good order, a RM300 fee will apply. For better peace of mind, they are offering a device protection at RM15/month that’s comes with 48 hours replacement.  For now the Zerolution program covers 4 devices – the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, HTC One M9+ and the Samsung Galaxy A7. All new flagship devices will be available on Zerolution moving forward and gradually its existing line up including the iPhone 6 will be offered later.  Considering the easy ownership and zero penalty charges involved, the Zerolution is a hassle free way of owning a device. This isn’t a leasing program as you do own the phone after 24 months. If you calculate the monthly payment over 24 months it is cheaper than buying the phone outright at full retail price. That’s of course without the optional early upgrade (RM30/month) and device protection (RM15/month) add-on.  For those that change phones on an annual basis, this can be seen as a leasing programme as you can swap phones easily without the hassle of trading in. Once you’ve completed the full 24 months period, the phone is yours to keep.  Below is one example of buying the Galaxy S6 on Zerolution versus a typical 24 months contract.

You’ll be able to make use of the WhatsApp Web client given that you have these three browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Frequent WhatsApp users who’d prefer to have access to the app on their desktop can use the web client here and just scan the QR code using your iPhone to link your computer. Other than having a steady internet connection for your desktop, one must have their smart phones constantly connected to the internet, so WhatsApp Web can’t function if otherwise. It’ll also sync chat history and it’ll reflect on both devices the same so nothing will be lost in translation. Sending photos on the other hand, can be done by pulling files from your desktop or webcam, easing cross-platform sharing. WhatsApp on your desktop can be a win-win in the office too, saving you from always looking at your mobile phone and pretending to do work without getting caught. Just be sure to not let it affect your work productivity. [  SOURCE  ]"
Alexander Wong,All you need to know: 10 new features on MIUI 7,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/20/xiaomi-miui-7-top-10-features/,"Android,Custom ROM,MIUI 7,MIUI 7 Features,MIUI OS,Xiaomi","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-08-20,"After 5 years running, Xiaomi has made its global announcement of  MIUI 7  yesterday. With its humble beginnings back in 2010, the MIUI custom ROM has grown with over 150 Million users and is supported by a team of 750 people.  While the interface looks the same as the current MIUI 6, the new version offers more customisation and it gets smarter with a several intelligent tweaks. Read on for the 10 new features after the break. Your smart phone is a personal device and MIUI has been known for its wide array of radical customisable themes. On MIUI 7, they are really pushing the themes up a notch with greater focus on design details. With Muse, a new theme creator, you can design new interfaces with animations including the lock screen like never before. And this is done without the complicated coding. Receiving phone calls can be made more interesting especially when it’s from your loved ones. Instead of having a static photo, you can change this to a 5 second looping video.  If you have tons of instant message groups and social media accounts, your phone would always be demanding for attention. While you can always turn on silent mode before sleeping, MIUI 7 is making the DND mode automated with the help of a Mi Band. The Mi Band as an activity tracker knows when you’re asleep and will automatically turns on DND mode. Once you’re awake, it is also smart enough to disable DND mode so that you start receiving alerts right away.  Especially for the elderly, viewing normal text size can be a strain. While you can easily bump up the text size, the execution isn’t always perfect with broken lines and ugly alignment. With MIUI 7, it now offers an even larger XXL size and it is done beautifully in any screen without breaking its original layout design.  Data is core in every smart phone experience. Not everyone has a huge data plan and high-speed coverage could be limited especially in developing countries. To ensure an optimal internet experience, Xiaomi has incorporated Opera Max Data Saver which helps to compress data not only in browser but also in other internet connected apps. This helps to speed up loading and will also help to cut down consumption of your precious internet quotas.  For those with kids, your smart phone is the best camera of capturing moments in any situation. If need to show photos of your baby, it can be a daunting task if your album is filled with random pictures. To make things easier, they now have a Baby Album which automatically creates a collection for your baby with the help of facial recognition.  Similar to Huawei’s Magazine cover feature, you can have a different lock screen wallpaper every single day. There’s a selection of high quality images and this will be made available first in India before it is released for international markets.   Sometimes your kids might want to “steal” your phone for a short game or two. To keep your data private and phone settings intact from curious fingers, the Child Mode lets you pick which apps and features that are accessible to them.   Performance is always a concern of users and MIUI 7 has been tweaked to provide a faster experience. App start up times have been optimised by loading both data and animations in parallel and Xiaomi claims a 30% improvement in app response.  According to Xiaomi, as much as 48% of battery life are consumed by background processes such as GPS, mobile data and WiFi. To squeeze more life from each charge, they have optimised its background usage as well as regulating app sync times to minimise consumption. As a result, this would give 10% better battery life which is equivalent of up to 3 hours extra each day.  If you can’t wait to give it a go, MIUI 7 will be available as a beta release beginning 24th August on the  official MIUI website . The Beta release will support Redmi 1S, Redmi 2, Mi 3, Mi 4, Mi 4i, Redmi Note 3G and Redmi Note 4G. To watch the full presentation, you can hit play in the embedded video below."

ASUS doesn’t seem to be slowing down, as the  Zenfone 2 Laser  (ZE500KG) has been spotted on SIRIM Malaysia’s database, meaning a fourth device could be soon announced by the mobile computing company. Appearing in SIRIM’s list could mean that ASUS could discretely be planning a joint event to release two (or more) devices at one time. ASUS’ ZE500KG model is mainly a mid-ranger that sports a 5-inch HD 720p display with a 1.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 410, under the hood. Multitasking will be handled by the 2GB of RAM and storage comes in either 8GB or 16GB of expandable memory. Maintaining its namesake, the Laser will offer a laser auto-focus system coupled with its 8-megapixel rear shutter at a f/2.0 aperture and PixelMaster technology. Making your way up front, you’ll be surprised with the budget smart phone having a 5-megapixel f/2.0 selfie shooter. Powering all this will be the 2,070 mAh battery and it’ll come with a ZenUI skinned version of Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. No surprises here, as the budget friendly model in the Laser series only supports 3G HSPA+ in its dual-SIM connectivity compatibility. How much will this wallet friendly device cost? It’ll likely be around RM 400 – RM 500, as the higher end phone around RM 631 (converted from India’s sale price) for the ZE550KL model of the same phone. We’ll update everyone as we know more but be sure to stay tuned cause it won’t be long following the SIRIM listing. [  SOURCE  ]"

The  ASUS Zenfone 2  series is a value buy especially when you can own a 4GB RAM smart phone with heaps of storage for under RM1,200. If you had the interest to get one, you might want to buy yours before this weekend.  According to  DirectD , both high-spec ASUS Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) models with 4GB RAM will be increased by RM100. The Zenfone 2 4GB RAM + 32GB which is priced at RM1,099 will be increased to RM1,199, while the 64GB storage model will be marked up from RM1,299 to RM1,399.  The prices mentioned above are inclusive of GST and comes with ASUS Malaysia 1 year warranty. With every purchase, DirectD is offering a free original bumper case while stocks last.  It is quite unusual to see a sudden price increase for smart phones. This could be due to our weakening currency against the dollar or a re-positioning of ASUS smart phone line up since there are more Zenfone 2 variants coming out way like the Qualcomm based  Zenfone Selfie  and  Zenfone 2 Laser .  The Zenfone 2 is a dual-SIM 4G LTE device and it offers a large 5.5″ Full HD IPS screen. Under the hood, it runs on Intel’s 64-bit 2.3GHz Quad-Core Atom Z3580 processor that’s mated to 4GB of RAM. Whether you pick 32GB or 64GB of storage, the Zenfone 2 also comes with microSD expansion slot. The list continues with a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with dual-LED flash, a front facing 5MP selfie shooter and a decent 3,000mAh capacity battery.

Arif Lee,More leaks of the 2015 Nexus device appear,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/17/more-leaks-of-the-2015-nexus-device-appear/,"Android M,google,Google Nexus 5 2015,LG Nexus 2015,LG Nexus 5,Nexus,Nexus 5,Nexus 5 2015","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,nexus 5,Rumour Mill",2015-08-17,"Inching closer to Q4, we’re sure to get more juicy details about the new Nexuses. Said to come from two manufacturers LG and Huawei in two sizes – a 5.2-inch phone and a 5.7-inch phablet, respectively. An alleged image of LG’s  Nexus  offering has made its rounds showing how the phone looks like from the back. There’s nothing much to run on regarding the device in the image except for the camera module and a circular metal ring below the camera sensor. No branding appears on the actual body of the phone but there is a white sticker with an LG logo on it, so we can safely assume this is LG’s Nexus and not the Huawei Nexus. Protrusion of the camera could mean that the phone’s design is very thin, giving LG not much to work with in terms of how much the camera sensor juts out. Accompanying the camera (purported 16-megapixel or 20.7-megapixel) will be what seems to look like laser focus technology and dual-LED flash. Some go on to claim the circular metal ring is actually a fingerprint scanner; a design differing from Android’s design cues but very much like Apple’s (differing placements). However, we advise all of this be taken with a large dosage of salt – mainly because LG has been fairly discrete about its Nexus, though it does match older renders  here . The majority believe Google will keep to its annual scheduled release of the Nexus(es) and Android M, which is due usually in October. Since there’s still 2 months to go, be sure to expect more rumours and leaks as autumm nears. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Dubbed as the “Venice” it offers a double edge display with a slide out QWERTY keyboard like its former  Blackberry Torch . Following @evleaks’s  initial leak  on the new slider, he has come back with another render, this time with its full QWERTY keyboard exposed. For the BlackBerry purist, you’ll appreciate that it retains the same 4 row keys instead of the Passport’s compact 3 row layout. With the recent rumours that BlackBerry is exploring an  Android device , the new slider could be their first device to run on Android Lollipop. In terms of availability, Evan Blass has added that it  will be available  in the US in November with all 4 carriers supporting it.  There’s still a market for QWERTY based smart phones and for it to run on Android is definitely interesting. Even Samsung has tried to reboot its QWERTY keyboard experience by introducing its  Keyboard cover  for the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+. For Android users who are itching for the tactile feel of a physical keyboard, this is one device to look out for. In terms of pricing, don’t expect this to be cheap as BlackBerry will definitely position their slider as a premium device especially with that curve display."
Arif Lee,Lenovo Malaysia launches the VIBE Shot – a camera centric smartphone,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/18/lenovo-malaysia-launches-the-vibe-shot-a-camera-centric-smartphone/,"Android,camera phone,Lenovo,Lenovo Vibe Shot,Lenovo Vibe Shot Malaysia,Malaysia,Malaysia launch,Selfie,vibe shot,VIBE UI","Android,Lenovo,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-08-18,"Driven towards a market that has a need for a premium smart phone with a good camera, the  VIBE Shot  promises to be a stylish and powerful pocket companion for capturing those special life moments. An attempt at being Lenovo’s first camera smartphone crossover device, it’ll join the list of other devices that the company has  released  – upping their game from budget options to a more luxurious label. Built to look like a camera, albeit sporting a 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display on the front, the phone features a camera button solely to improve usability for instant camera activation and photo taking. You’ll get a 16-megapixel sensor on the rear and a 8-megapixel front facing shooter on the smart phone – including a 16:9 BSI sensor and optical image stabilisation. Packing a tri-colour LED (an industry first) and an infrared auto-focus that Lenovo assures to be on par with laser auto-focus. A detailed breakdown of the infrared auto-focus follows: We’ve yet to test the camera’s prowess yet but be sure to check again once we’ve received a unit to review. A readily available quick switch toggle gives users an ability to choose from the easier Auto mode, or the more in-depth Pro mode. Smart Composition is said to be the headliner of the Auto Mode – with an automatic scene detection and onscreen “point and shoot” built-in. The latter of the two modes, hands shutterbugs the tools to manually control settings of photos, like aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings – a great combination that could supplement those creatively inspiring photos. Designed to look like a regular point and shoot, glass is apparent on both sides with metal keeping it together in the middle.  Housing a 1.7GHz Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor (64 bit) and mated with 3GB of RAM, the  VIBE  Shot should handle camera tasks just fine, while providing a fluid user experience. We’ll be getting the 32GB internal storage variant, expandable up to 128GB with a MicroSD card slot and it’ll also be equip with Dual-SIM slots (LTE ready). Out of the box, the VIBE Shot runs Lenovo’s own VibeUI on top of Android 5.1 and is powered by a 3,000 mAh non-removable battery. Measuring just 7.6mm thick, the VIBE Shot should please those who find it a burden to slip point and shoot’s in their pockets. The VIBE Shot will be available in Carmine Red and Graphite Grey at RM 1,399 and comes with a VIBE Xtension Selfie Flash (worth RM 99) for free. The camera centric mobile device can be found at all Lenovo Smartphone Retail Partners from today onwards."

The 6″ Sony Xperia C5 Ultra and its new compact Xperia M5 will be available for pre-orders in Malaysia through  11street .  Both models are dual-SIM ready and 11street will be accepting orders starting from this Wednesday, 19th August until 31st August 2015. In terms of price, surprisingly they are quite competitively priced at RM1,399 for the Xperia C5 Ultra Dual and RM1,599 for the Xperia M5. The 11street exclusive pre-orders will start shipping in early September.  To recap, the Xperia C5 Ultra is not only their new phablet but it’s also their new contender in the selfie centric space. Not only it gets a huge 6″ Full HD display, it also features 13MP cameras for both front and back. To get the best out of your selfie shots, the front camera has a wider 22mm view and it gets a soft LED Selfie Flash for better illumination. With an ultra-thin bezel, the Xperia C5 Ultra looks almost bezel-less and the shorter width makes it easy to handle with a single hand.  The internals however is similar to the current Xperia C4, with a 1.7GHz MediaTek Octa-Core Processor that’s mated with 2GB of RAM, along with 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. With a 2,930mAh non-removable battery, it is rated to last up to 2 days and overall it weighs 187 grams. At RM1,399, the Xperia C5 Ultra merely RM100 more than the Xperia C4, and you get a huge upgrade in both screen and optics. You can read more in our Xperia C5 Ultra  announcement post . The Xperia M5 is looking like a compact flagship that’s a worthy successor of the  Xperia Z3 Compact . The exterior design looks like an Xperia Z3 series and it even comes with IP68 water resistance. The Xperia M5 has a 5″ Full HD display and under the hood you’ll find MediaTek’s high-end 2.0GHz Helio X10 octa-core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. It also gets 16GB of storage and a microSD slot that accepts up to 200GB in capacity.  In the camera department, things get a little interesting. While the Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3+ still carries the same old 20.7MP shooter, the M5 features a newer 21.5MP IMX230 sensor that’s features Phase Detection Auto Focus. The result is clearer shots of moving objects thanks to its 0.2 seconds focus time. For the narcissists, they won’t be disappointed either as the front gets a 13MP camera just like the Xperia C5 Ultra. With a smaller 2,600mAh capacity battery, the Xperia M5 still boasts up to 2 days of battery life. Overall it weighs 143 grams and has a thickness of 7.6mm.

If you’re wondering how easy it is to repair, we turn to the dismantling experts at iFixit.  Most unibody smart phones these days are quite complicated to dismantle and it is common to see them using tons of adhesive and proprietary screws that would require special tools. But not with the OnePlus 2.  With its replaceable sandstone back cover taken out, the back plate is held together with standard Phillips screws. The non-removable 3,300mAh battery is kept in place with a little adhesive and it shouldn’t pose much problems if you need to replace it. The rest of the components such as the camera module and the USB Type C port are modular, making replacements an easy task. Probably the only difficulty would be the display as the IPS LCD is fused together with the glass. So if you’ve cracked your screen, you would need to replace the whole piece which can be quite costly. Overall iFixit rates the OnePlus 2 with a repairability score of 7/10, which is easier than the first OnePlus One that  scored  5/10. As comparison, the Galaxy S6  scored  4/10, while the HTC One M9  did badly  at just 2/10.

Vernon Chan,5 Top new Features of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/18/5-top-new-features-of-the-samsung-galaxy-note-5/,"Android,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Features,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone,Top 5 Features","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-18,"As expected, Samsung revealed its fifth generation flagship phablet – the  Galaxy Note 5  at the  Samsung Unpacked 2015  event in New York. The new Note delivers a whole refreshed look, packs an amazing camera and an enhanced S Pen experience. Having had an exclusive  hands-on  experience (you can read and watch about it  here ) I can tell you that from the offset, the Note 5 doesn’t seem do anything ground-breaking. The Note’s crown jewels were always the big format display and exclusive stylus experience. Having said that, it’s an evolution from the  previous generation  with little touches that enhance productivity and overall user experience.  Here are my favourite five top features of the Galaxy Note 5. Aside from the size of the big display, the Note 5 looks nothing like its predecessor. Gone is the faux leather and chromed frame. In fact, the Note 5 has more in common in terms of looks and build with the beautiful  Galaxy S6 . In comes a premium build with an all-metal finish and beautiful glass curved back.  What’s important to note is that, despite having a large 5.7-inch QHD AMOLED display, the Note 5 is actually smaller, thinner and lighter than the previous Note devices.  If you loved the S6 and S6 edge, then you’ll appreciate the lines, curves and feel of the new Note 5 Samsung has finally introduced a spring-loaded auto-eject mechanism to the infamous S Pen. So no more fiddling and using your nail to detach the stylus from the silo. It makes perfect sense, really, and something you’ll definitely appreciate. The S Pen itself features better build, and seems more durable and less plasticky than the previous versions.  The S Pen is more responsive and the hand-writing recognition is better than ever, making writing and drawing as natural as doing it with a real pen.  The Air Command is a Note special. Click the button on the S Pen and a pop-up menu shows up on screen. It gives you quick access apps and features. This is a much-loved feature of the Note series. With the Note 5, it gets even better. Now you can customise Air Command to modify and add up to three favourite apps to it. It’s really neat and a long time coming. This is one of those “Now why didn’t they think of this before?” features. Imagine this scenario. You need to quickly jot down something – a phone number, a message or a scribble. You’ll need to scan your fingerprint or unlock your phone, search for your app, fire up your app and then write your message. What if you can do it with a single step?  Well, now you can. Just detach the stylus and write on the screen. There is no step two. And that’s brilliant.  In smartphones, especially in the flagship Galaxy series, audio has always been something of an afterthought. Pretty strange if you think about it. Since we spend so much time on our phones listening to music, watching movies and playing games, why isn’t it made to deliver better quality sound? Audiophiles will love this. The Note 5 now has Ultra High Quality Audio (UHQA) support built in. That means you get up to 24bit/192kHz quality audio. A UHQA upscaler enhances existing MP3 music and make them all more listenable and enjoyable.  The Note 5 includes a new UHQA-Bluetooth codec which means better quality audio streamed to your favourite Bluetooth headphones. And naturally, UHQA works perfectly with Samsung LEVEL. Samsung didn’t just adopt the best design and build elements from the S6 and S6 edge. It also brought one of my biggest loves about the S6 series – the amazing camera. We’ve raved about the  S6 camera  and even our  readers tend to agree .  Make no mistake, the 16MP f/1.9 snapper with OIS is stunning, the best on any smartphone. It features an enhanced software-based OIS for smooth, shake-free video. Shoot high-resolution stills or 4K video. The only limit is your imagination. For taking selfies, the Note 5 gets a 5MP shooter, which is an upgrade from a 3.7MP unit on the Note 4.  Performance is unmatched in low light and if you need fast autofocus and shutter, you’ve got the best in your hand. Photography is often spontaneous and unplanned, so simply double-click on the Home button to fire up the camera. All in under a second. So there you go, my 5 top features of the new Galaxy Note 5. I’m pretty sure you have your own favourite features, give us your thoughts below.  Related Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ Posts

Happening from the 26 th  of August up till 1 st  of September 2015, the Unitysale promises to slash service and product prices up to 94%. The 5 said companies will be joining forces to provide a celebratory experience with their contributions towards users who sign up anew and also existing users who have used their platforms before. Akin to corroborate the Digital Malaysia initiative, the 5 e-commerce team up is purposed to leverage the 20 million internet users of Malaysia. By capitalising on the 66% of the population, online shopping has grown exponentially in the last two years and hands buyers a new medium to shop. Luca Barberis (Managing Director of ZALORA Malaysia) went on to say that it is through the partnership of the biggest e-commerce players the industry can strength itself. Echoing sentiments by his counterpart at Lazada, who said that “as more users use the service, more feedback will be received”, thus proving that through collaboration all 5 organisations will benefit. Improving platforms and customer service was also addressed at the event. To quote Lazada’s CEO, Hans-Peter Ressel said “the Unitysale will be a joint-campaign to benefit Malaysians together” and Lazada will push for better service through their larger warehouse that’s set to be in full swing come November or December of this year. They’re plans also extend to East Malaysia, by setting up a first warehouse there, to shorten delivery times by having inventory on-hand. Similarly, foodpanda is said to be facing the same qualms with complains of delivery times, so they’ve attempted to mediate that by creating smaller cluster areas to ensure all food is delivered in one hour. HappyFresh Malaysia’s Managing Director, Opal Wu also reiterated that time-saving will be one of the biggest advantages of e-commerce. Families can now spend less time going to the market and local grocery store by moving their foodstuffs purchases online. Saving time may be only one of the said perks of e-commerce, as with economic constraints both Uber and foodpanda agree that in trying times, Malaysians should try to save money. “With the cost of private transportation gradually going up, uberX aims to help riders save by using our technology to maximise efficiency”, said Leon Foong, General Manager of Uber Malaysia. Here’s a sneak-peak of the deals coming from the respective e-commerce sites:"

While the metal frame helps to absorb impact from the sides, direct drops facing downwards will definitely cause some serious damage to the screen.  Even when it was dropped with the back facing down from 1 metre height, the impact is strong enough to crack the protruding camera lens. It is interesting to point out that they rated the Note 5 to be more durable than the Galaxy S6 but it is still behind the predominantly metal iPhone 6 and HTC One M9.

Most die hard Samsung fans have been frowning upon the lack of a removable battery and expandable storage when the  Galaxy S6  was launched earlier this year. This would not change for the new Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+, leaving users to rely on its built-in storage and cloud options should they need to store more.  A few days back, there had been  rumours  that the Galaxy Note 5 will be having a hybrid SIM tray slot, which allows you to plonk a microSD card into the 2nd SIM slot if the need arises. That lead turned out to be false, as the alleged proof was actually a  Galaxy A8  which was recently launched here at RM1,888. As written on the official spec sheet, the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ will not come with microSD expansion. If you’re not convinced, a dual-SIM Galaxy Note 5 in Taiwan had its  SIM tray slot shown off  and it only fits 2 nano-SIM cards. This is the same model that has been certified in our Malaysian SIRIM database carrying the model number SM-N9208.  Let’s face it, the microSD slot is slowly disappearing from flagship smart phones these days. Performance is one of such reasons as there are different microSD standards and a slow card could hamper the overall user experience. This is more apparent as Samsung uses its high performance  Universal Flash Storage  and some alleged that unreliable external storage could hamper its overall performance. Samsung isn’t the only one singing the same tune as both  Google  and Xiaomi too have omitted  microSD slots  from their flagship device. If you’re dying for a microSD expansion, you’re left with just a handful including the HTC One M9+, Xperia Z3+, LG G4, OPPO R7 Plus and the Huawei P8.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

If you’re interested, just drop your details  here  and you’ll be in the running for special invites to purchase the 2016 Flagship Killer. It didn’t say when exactly they are giving the invites or when the OnePlus 2 will be available, but the site mentions that the codes will be given out on a first come first serve basis. So it is best that you  register yourself  like right now for a higher chance of getting it.  The OnePlus 2 was  announced  a few weeks back and it went on sale outside of China on 11th August. A limited number of  imported units  from the Chinese market has made their way to Malaysia with the 64GB capacity version going for RM1,899. To recap, the OnePlus 2 gets a 5.5″ Full HD display, an Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, 13MP main camera with Laser AutoFocus, 5MP front selfie cam and a larger 3,300mAh capacity battery.  The OnePlus 2 also gets a fingerprint scanner at the front and it now uses a futureproof USB Type C connector that’s reversible. The build quality has been improved with a more prominent metal frame and there’s also an alert slider that lets you manage your notification alerts. The OnePlus 2 is also a dual-SIM device supporting 4G LTE but it still doesn’t support microSD expansion and it also lacks a NFC which was offered on the previous One.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Arif Lee,32GB model of the Mi 4i to go on sale tomorrow in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/17/32gb-model-of-the-mi-4i-to-go-on-sale-tomorrow-in-malaysia/,"Dual Sim,mi 4i,Mi 4i Malaysia,Mi 4i Price,Mi4i,Mi4i 32GB Malaysia,smart phone,Xiaomi Malaysia,Xiaomi Malaysia Mi4i 32GB,Xiaomi Mi 4i,Xiaomi Mi 4i Malaysia,Xiaomi Mi 4i Malaysia Price,Xiaomi Mi4i,Xiaomi Mi4i 32GB","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-08-17,"UPDATE  : Mi 4i 32GB is priced officially at RM 899 – only dark grey colour available. 
 Close to a month after the launch of the 32GB model  Mi 4i  in India, Mi Malaysia’s Facebook page gave us the same wonderful news to happen at 12pm tomorrow. Budding buyers were fighting fears of the 16GB model (non-expandable) since its introduction to our shores but the 32GB variant might just be the answer to those worrying woes. Keeping the original spec sheet as it is, the device will run a second-gen Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor (1.7 GHz) on board the 5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) screen device and 2GBs of RAM will help optimise the MIUI skin of Android 5.0.2. Although capable of a LTE enabled dual-SIM offering, the system isn’t a hybrid SIM + MicroSD, hence why the bump in the internal memory storage is much sought after. Tomorrow is not long off but we’ll choose to speculate the pricing of the 32GB Mi 4i – India offers the two models for Rs. 12,999 (RM 814) and Rs. 14,999 (RM 939), 16GB and 32GB, respectively. On the other hand, here in Malaysia the 16GB model goes for RM 749, leading us to believe that the 32GB capacity model could go for less than RM 900.

It was quite unusual considering the  Galaxy Note 4  and the  Galaxy S6/S6 edge  were announced with their respective Gear VR headsets.  The folks at CNET had managed to asked Samsung Mobile’s co-CEO Mr. JK Shin about it and he assured that the Gear VR for the latest phablets will be coming soon. He mentions that the launch will be a surprise but he stopped short of dropping further hints on what to expect. As teased towards the end of last night’s event, Samsung will be launching its  Gear S2  smart watch next month in Berlin during IFA 2015. With the Galaxy Note 5 out of the way, there’s room for more announcements and it is possible that the new Gear VR could be revealed at the same event.  The Gear VR is powered by Oculus technology and it uses the smart phone’s screen as the display. Initially announced for the Galaxy Note 4, the latest Gear VR designed for the S6/S6 event has  finally arrived  in Malaysia with the price tag of RM799.

soyacincau,Compared: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 versus Galaxy Note 4,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/compared-samsung-galaxy-note-5-versus-galaxy-note-4/,"galaxy note 5,S Pen,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note 4,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Malaysia,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,stylus","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Nearly a year has gone since the  Galaxy Note 4  and flash-forward to the present with the arrival of the much anticipated  Galaxy Note 5  is a reality. Today we aim to pit the old against the new and discuss the main differences, mainly positive but some questionable. The mobile tech giant has made some brand-new features both in hardware and software. Mentioning the former first, the processor gets an upgrade from the Exynos 5433 (SM-N910C) / Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 (SM-N910S) to the chart-topping AnTuTu scorer, the Exynos 7420. Samsung’s newest phablet also gets a 1GB bump in the RAM department compared to the Note 4 (3GB), adhering to the current industry standard for new flagships. Furthering connectivity speeds is the Note 5’s latest LTE Cat 6/Cat 9 pushing the older Cat 4 enabled Note 4 out of the water, with blistering future-proof speeds once telecommunication infrastructure is done catching up. Moving to the camera, we’ll see a similar 16-megapixel main camera, but the front shutter is now 5-megapixels from the previous 3.7-megapixels. Samsung has said to make the camera interface zippier as launching speeds have improved from 1.1 seconds to 0.6 seconds. Audio advancements are now up scaled to support an ultra-high-quality listening experience – couple that with Samsung Milk Music and you’ll be set to enjoy yourself. The star of the show of course will be the spring loaded eject-able S-Pen that will no longer chip anymore finger nails. Samsung has promised that the feeling of writing will be as close as to writing on paper but hasn’t mentioned raw specifications of increasing pressure sensitivity as for now. Hardware aside, it’ll also be enhanced to Scroll Capture long screenshots with Screen Write: a sure favourite for long direction instructions and conversations. Air command will now always appear on-screen to assist you with your S-Pen functionality. Off-screen notes can be easily written with the S-Pen just by simply tapping on the screen with the stylus while in standby. PDF annotations are also easier with the S-Pen, giving users the means to simply sign a PDF document using the stylus and sending it off to be printed for your business needs. Design language also takes a turn with the latest iteration of the Note series. Gone are the days of plastically backs and in comes a more superior built product. Comparing the old and the new side by side and you’ll be able to tell them distinctively apart, especially so when you take a look around the edges and rounded backing of the Note 5. Placement of the camera and audio speakers have been adjusted to make the device better to look at and change the listening experience a little. Making up the bottom is now the moved speaker, and audio jack, while the positions of the S-Pen and micro-USB port remain. The phablet is now lighter too, weighing in at 171g, opposed to 176g (Note 4) and comes in a smaller footprint – 153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6mm compared to the slightly larger Note 4 (153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5mm) Samsung has addressed some qualms – mostly related to its stance on premium materials and removable batteries. Seeing a change of trend towards users who prefer a more luxurious feel, the Korean manufacturer has decided that it was time to exclude removable batteries in replacement of a metal encased design From the S6 series to the current Note 5, we’re now seeing a more streamlined aesthetically pleasing device with more metal and glass. Although, there will always be trade-offs and this time it’s no exception, as the glass will pick up finger prints and smudges quite easily. The battery also takes a hit, now only 3,000mAh battery housed in non-removable fashion due to the unibody design, which dips from the old Note 4 – 3,220mAh. Worry not, as the Note 5 will be helped along by fast charging the device from 0% – 100% takes 90 minutes, 9 minutes quicker than its predecessor. If cables is not your thing, you’ll be happy as the newer Note even supports fast wireless charging, although charge times are nothing to shout about (0% – 100% in 120 minutes). Other than the removable battery omission, we’re also seeing an exodus of MicroSD support from the Note 5 – unsure why they decided to go down this route, seeing as dual-SIM trays usually are hybrids, allowing users to choose two SIMs or use one + a MicroSD card. Lastly, seemingly seen as an odd decision, Samsung decided to leave out the infared blaster seen on older released devices. To cap-off, the Note 5 has made refinements in these categories: and sacrificed some features in the process, as well: We’ll see how the Note 5 fares when it goes on sale in selected regions, while it’ll make an appearance sometime in September for our local market.

Touted to be the first tablet with customisable functional back covers, ASUS is adding the ZenPad 7.0 (Z370CG) into its tablet line-up and it joins its entry-level  ZenPad C . The ZenPad series is the tablet equivalent of its Zenfone line up and eventually this would replace its current FonePad and MeMoPad tablet series. Although, not booming with power the tablet runs a respectable Quad-core 64-bit Intel Atom x3-C3230 processor. RAM and internal storage of this budget device will slot in at 2GB and 16GB, respectively. Should you need more storage to store your movies, the ZenPad 7.0 comes with a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB extra. The 7-inch screen promises a 1280 x 800 (HD) resolution IPS display and will be sure to please those looking for an affordable HD capable tablet. Camera optics stand at an 8-megapixel rear sensor, while the front gets only a 2-megapixel shutter. Those consuming media could be interested in the DTS-HD front speaker that the ZenPad 7.0 is equip with – touted to offer premium sound by ASUS. As a portable media device, the tablet will be considered quite light; 272g. It should be noted that the screen to body ratio is 72% and the dimensions are 189 x 110.9 x 8.7mm – considered light and compact for its dimensions, probably due to the plastic body that still has an upmarket feel, thanks to the leather-looking texture. Given the device’s affordable nature, it doesn’t come with 4G LTE and we’ll only get a 3G model that supports a single SIM. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with ASUS’ own Zen UI. Functionality will be one of the main aspects of the 7-inch tablet with a slew of easily detachable back covers, each with its own use.  For a touch of personalisation there’s a variety of of colourful Zen Cases that snaps on easily. For a longer battery life, there’s a Power Case pushes a total of up to 15 hours of battery life on a single charge.

According to ASUS, the ZenPad 7.0 will be sold below RM700 and it is expected to go on sale on 26th of August. So far that’s all we have for the ZenPad series and ASUS Malaysia is still mum on the availability of the rest of the ZenPad line up which includes the ZenPad 8.0 and the top-of-the-line  ZenPad S 8.0 .

Coming in two parts the back cover that holds on to the back of either the  S6 edge+  or the  Note 5 , the  Keyboard Cover  can be snapped on and off easily in either orientation (front for typing, back for utilising the whole screen). Samsung has had a  history  of venturing to a wide range of stuff so this doesn’t really surprise anyone (just to spoil it for you, it includes a toilet seat, helicopter, and hospital). Typing will be supported by the QWERTY style keyboard that has 3 Android buttons – Recent Apps, Home and Back button. One could assume that the Keyboard Cover would benefit to those who felt that the typing experience on the two said phablets wouldn’t be a great experience when one-handed. We spent a short time with the Keyboard Cover attached to the edge+: describing the keys akin to a soft resin-like texture and it felt flimsy at best. A lackluster solution but tries to appeal to those who like tactility when typing on the capacitive screen. These tactile inclinded typist that prefer BlackBerry’s signature typing experience might just consider jumping ship given the option to add this US  $80 extension. The keyboard itself doesn’t have any special technology, merely the keys will touch the screen as if your fingertips would but it does move up the UI when the keyboard is in place. Now the real question comes about; would you buy it?"

Unlike the early generation Gear smart watches, the Gear S2 is  expected  to cut down on non essential features like a camera and infrared blaster.   With Apple’s new  Watch  going full swing, Samsung is speculated to release up to 3 distinctive line ups that cover different price range differentiated by the materials used.

You can check out our  Galaxy Note5/S6 edge+ price plan comparison  from the big 4 telcos.  Samsung’s latest phablets the  Galaxy Note 5  and  Galaxy S6 edge+  were launched last week, both offering 5.7″ Quad HD displays and 4GB of RAM. For Malaysia, both devices are expected to arrive sometime in early September and if you’re curious about its pricing, we can gather some clues from our southern neighbours. The Galaxy Note 5 had went on sale in Singapore last Saturday, 15th August with two colour options Black Sapphire and Gold Platinum. Meanwhile the double edge Galaxy S6 edge+ will be available a week later on 22nd August with the same colour options. Just like the Galaxy S6/S6 edge, the Singapore market has the option for multiple storage options with 32GB and 64GB available. For easy reference, we’ve compared the launch prices of the past Galaxy flagships in Singapore below, which are inclusive of GST. As expected, the Galaxy Note 5 is priced slightly higher than the Galaxy S6, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ is a notch higher than the S6 edge.  Based on the pricing in Singapore, we can roughly guess how much it will cost in Malaysia. With GST taking effect since April, you can expect to pay much more for the Note 5 compared to the previous RM2,499 price tag for the Galaxy Note 4. Assuming if GST was in effect back then, the Galaxy Note 4 would cost RM2,649 which is more than the Galaxy S6. Furthermore, the Note series is usually priced slightly higher than its compact Galaxy S series model. We are guessing that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM2,699 while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovering around RM3,199. Take note that this is just an estimate and Samsung Malaysia could price them differently considering our depreciating ringgit and both phablets will be coming with Dual-SIM slots.

Like the name suggests, the  S6 edge+  is a larger Galaxy S6 edge with a phablet size display. The screen isn’t the only thing that has been upgraded as the the internals for both hardware and software have gotten plus size in their own areas.  Underneath this familiar looking device, the Galaxy S6 edge+ is an identical Galaxy Note 5 underneath minus the productivity S-Pen. Strangely Samsung didn’t release the successor of the  Galaxy Note Edge , but instead they have upgraded an existing Galaxy S smart phone it into a phablet device.  The Galaxy S6 edge is a beautiful looking thing but holding it isn’t as reassuring as the flat edged Galaxy S6. On the bigger Galaxy S6 edge+, it is no different. The front has curved front glass that slops onto its thin frame. If we have both the S6 edge+ and Note 5 side by side, the Note feels more reassuring to hold with its thicker sides and a curved back glass that’s more natural to hold. The rest are identical, from the placement of its volume and power buttons down to its headphone jack, micro USB port and speaker grill. Looking at the top, you’ll find a SIM tray slot and that’s when you notice that it lacks an infrared blaster that used to be located in the middle. The front display is a Note category 5.7″ display that does a similar Quad HD resolution (2560×1440) with a pixel density of 518 ppi. Overall, it is a tiny bit thinner at 6.9mm (S6 edge: 7.0mm) and it is 21 grams heavier at 153g (S6 edge: 132g).   Although it shares the same Octa-Core Exynos processor, the Galaxy S6 edge+ gets 4GB RAM, which is 1GB more than the standard model. For storage, it has the same non-expandable 32GB or 64GB storage options using Samsung’s speedy Universal Flash Storage 2.0 solution. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery, which is 400mAh more than its smaller brother. While it gets the same native wireless charging, the Galaxy S6 edge+ like the Note 5 now supports faster wireless charging which does 0-100% charge in 2 hours.  Compared to the Galaxy Note Edge, the S6 edge curved display doesn’t offer as much features due to its reduced curvature at the sides. Instead of a permanent “edge” panel, the edge display that’s customisable for either left or right was mostly used for People Edge, a customisable bar with 5 of your closest contacts. In addition, Samsung wants you to reach out to your contacts in a more emotional manner. So in addition to the typical call, SMS and email, the People Edge lets you send sketches, emoticons and video. As mentioned in our  S6 edge review , we prefer if Samsung adds the option for instant message considering it is the main communication channel these days. While the screen is off, you still can take a peek on your notifications and infostream when you rub from left to right on the edge.  In addition, they have introduced “Apps Edge” which offers additional 5 edge shortcuts for your favourite apps. Since the S6 edge+ shares similar underpinnings as the non-plus model, we reckon Samsung could be extending these additions for its current S6 edge models. Another nice touch is that the edge features are now accessible on any screen. As comparison, it could only be triggered on the home screen and you can’t toggle it if you’re running other apps.  
The rest of the S6 edge+ remains unchanged. You get the same excellent 16MP f/1.9 OIS camera at the back and a front facing 5MP f/1.9 camera at the front for better lit selfies. Similar to the Note 5, it does get Live YouTube Broadcast from the camera app as well. Nope, the battery isn’t removable and despite us getting a dual-SIM version in Malaysia, there’s no microSD expansion for the S6 edge+ either.  So would you pick this over the Galaxy Note 5? They are identically the same underneath and the only difference is the curve display and productive S-Pen that sets them apart. The edge display to us has always been a technological showcase and it is hard to justify to pay a lot over a non-edge device for the sake of having a fancier screen. So the question of whether to get a Note 5 or an S6 edge+ really depends on whether you want something you can do more with or having a device that’s good to look at."

The  Redmi Note 2  is expected to be  announced today  along with its new  MIUI 7 OS . Before this, we were given a glimpse of the upcoming affordable phablet from its TEENA  certification listing , but now we get to see a clearer view on its exterior and its purported internals. The Redmi Note 2 retains a 5.5″ phablet sized display but this time it pushes a higher Full HD 1080p resolution, instead of HD 720p on the current Redmi Note. In terms of design, it looks like a bigger version of the  Mi 4i  and its rear camera lens is placed right smack in the middle. Since the Redmi series is often associated for value for money, one would expect an entry to mid-range processor. However the Redmi Note 2 seems to be packing some serious firepower with MediaTek’s 2.0GHz Octa-Core  MT6795 processor  that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. The processor is a Helio X10 unit, which is rather high-end and could be found on flagship devices like the HTC One M9+ and One E9+. For storage is gets 16GB which is expandable with microSD. For imaging it has a 13MP main + 5MP front cameras and powering the device is a 3,020mAh capacity battery. In terms of price, the Redmi Note 2 could be carrying a 999 CNY price tag (about RM623) and word has it that there could be an enhanced version that offers more RAM and storage. As expected, it would run on a newer Android 5.1 Lollipop with their latest MIUI 7 skin on top. Suddenly this looks like a better device than the  Mi 4i , don’t you think? [  SOURCE   2 ,  VIA  ]"

The two Nexus phones will be produced by Huawei and LG, as we have previously reported; and will come as a 5.7 inch phablet by Huawei and a 5.2 inch phone from LG. The devices even come with some dimensions,with the 5.2 inch LG Nexus to come in at  146.9 x 72.9 x 8/9.8mm and the 5.7 inch Huawei Nexus to be a larger 159.4 x 78.3 x 6.6/8.5mm. Given their thicknesses both devices will probably have some form of curve, with the greatest thickness in the middle not unlike that of the  Motorola Moto X .  An earlier rumour detailed that the 5.7 inch Nexus would have a QHD display as well as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC, but it hasn’t been confirmed yet. Both devices are also likely to be metal, especially the Huawei with an all-aluminium body, while the LG would probably sport a metal frame instead of having a metal unibody design. They’re rumoured to come out of the box with Android M too, but there aren’t any new details about the devices aside from dimensions. Still, this isn’t official info so best to take it with a pinch of salt. More images of the Nexus devices: [ VIA ][ SOURCE ,  1 ]"
Arif Lee,Flagship killer? That is what the ZTE Axon might be,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/13/flagship-killer-that-is-what-the-zte-axon-might-be/,"axon,lelong.my,ZTE,zte axon,ZTE Axon Lux,ZTE Axon Malaysia,ZTE Axon pro,ZTE Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,ZTE",2015-08-13,"Being a sub-brand of ZTE, the Chinese OEM looks like it’s trying to take on the smartphone market in a different way. Although the brand is not commonly known in our side of the world, with only China being the exception, the  Axon  Lux and Pro has popped up on lelong.my. Appearing on the e-commerce website under seller “androidworld”, this industry underdog is not shy about flaunting its specs. Being sold are two variants the Lux (RM 2,550) and the Pro (RM 3,499) – with the differences lying in the RAM, screen resolution and internal storage options. The Lux will get you 3GB RAM, a FHD (1920×1080) screen and 32GB of internal storage. A bump up with the Pro edition will get you 4GB RAM, a 2K (2560 x 1440) screen and a massive 128GB internal storage, both of which support MicroSD, up to an additional 128GB for a whopping grand total of 256GBs. Everything else about the China model variants are much the same – they both run a Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor that’s clocked at 2.0GHz. Screen sizes sit at 5.5-inch and they’re juiced by a 3,000mAh non-removable battery. Other features include HIFI quality audio; thanks to the AK4961 audio chip, a finger print and iris scanner for biometric security and NFC. The past has shown us that the iris scanner on the  vivo X5Pro  doesn’t work in our market, so that’s yet to be tested on the Axon. Photos will be shot on a duo combination of a 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear sensors and selfie-centric individuals can take advantage of the 8-megapixel front camera. The secondary camera located on the back will help with depth of field while taking photographs, similar to  HTC’s concept . LTE support, Bluetooth and dual-SIM (Nano-SIMs) make up the connectivity options for the device. ZTE’s Axon will run Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box, thickly skinned by MiFavor3.X. Noting that the device isn’t officially brought to our shores, it’ll be nice to see how it fares given the prices are comparable to other flagships that have already made a name for themselves locally.

The first details are about the graphical performance and the new image signal booster (ISP). They unfortunately haven’t given out anything else about the 64-bit chip, like its running temperature. The Adreno 530 GPU has a leg up on its predecessor, the Adreno 430 GPU that was in the Snapdragon 810 with the aforementioned 40% increase in graphic capability according o benchmarks. It also has a nice 40% decrease in power consumption too, thanks to power gating that lets the GPU go faster to idle modes and save power. So this means in the long run you’ll get to play/watch more. The GPU also includes OpenCL 2.0, OpenGL ES 3.1, the Android Extension pack as well as Renderscript with backwards compatibility. Video processing will be getting quite a boost as well thanks to the additional compute performance. As for the new Spectra ISP, the company says that you will be getting better image quality; with a maximum supported resolution of 25 megapixels with 30 fps video recorded at max resolution. The new setup will also be able to handle multi-camera setups with up to three sensors working in tandem, an improved hybrid autofocus framework as well as more natural skin tone reproduction.

Alexander Wong,Meet Xiaomi’s little router that fits in the palm of your hand,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/13/xiaomi-mi-wifi-nano-router-fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/,"Mi WiFi,Mi Wifi Nano,Router,Wireless Router,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Mi WiFi,Xiaomi Mi WiFi nano,Xiaomi WiFi nano,Xiaomi Wireless Router","Mobile Devices,Xiaomi",2015-08-13,"In typical Xiaomi fashion, they have just announced another  cheap  value for money device that’s big on features. Alongside the  Redmi Note 2 , they have revealed its Mi WiFi nano, a tiny little wireless router that fits on your palm.  Measuring just 91mm x 95.2mm, it is roughly the size of a coaster and it weighs just 100 grams. Best of all, it is priced at only 79 CNY, which is less than RM50.  The Mi WiFi nano supports 802.11n connectivity with speeds up to 300Mbps and it boast superior signal strength with its external PCB Antennas. This is good enough to cover a space of about 150 square metres.  For ease of management and monitoring, the Mi WiFi is connected via a mobile app that comes with an easy to use interface. Even if you’re not at home, you can see who’s accessing your network and set permissions if required. At the back, it gets 1X WAN port and 2X LAN Ports for wired connectivity.  Another neat feature is that it powers by a micro USB port. This makes remote usage possible as you can power the Mi WiFi nano router for up to 30 hours with a single 10,000mAh power bank.  It is amazing how the Mi WiFi nano could do so much in a little package. During its announcement, it showed a tear down of other competing routers and it clearly shows that efficient PCB design has contributed to its compact footprint. Will we ever get this officially in Malaysia? It is unlikely to be anytime soon until Xiaomi releases an English version of its firmware.  If you’re interested, the slightly bigger Mi WiFi is going for  RM118 , while the  enterprise grade Mi WiFi  with 1TB storage can be yours at  RM589 . Obviously they are imports and you would need to know Chinese to get started.  For more info, check out the  Mi WiFi nano  page."
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy Note 5: Not bigger but noticeably better all round,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/14/first-impressions-samsung-galaxy-note-5-malaysia/,"Android,Dual Sim,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Dual SIM,samsung Galaxy Note 5 First Impressions,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 hands-on,Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Malaysia,samsung malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-14,"Samsung has created a market for productivity phablets with its Galaxy Note series. With more players cashing in on the big screen phablet game, Samsung has to stay ahead beyond just having a bigger screen and better specs. The last Galaxy Note 4 was a great device but it faced stiffer competition with the likes of the iPhone 6 Plus.  With an early announcement for 2015, the Galaxy Note 5 aims to secure its spot as the new king of the hill for the remainder of 2015. Read on for our hands-on experience to find out about this 5th generation productivity phablet.    Before that let’s talk more about the device. The overall build quality has been improved and you get the same premium look and feel as the Galaxy S6. Gone is the faux leather back that made its debut on the Galaxy Note 3 and it now gets a stylish looking curve glass at the back, that’s similar to the  Mi Note . This design somewhat makes the device to better to hold as compared to the Galaxy S6 edge which has little area to grip with its thin metal frame. The screen size of 5.7″ has been retained but Samsung has managed to make the Galaxy Note 5 thinner (7.6mm) and lighter (171g) than its predecessor. On-board the Galaxy Note 5 gets a choice of either 32GB and 64GB storage options. Like the Galaxy S6, there’s no expandable microSD card memory and you would need to rely on cloud storage for further expansion. The front Super AMOLED display still retains its Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440 and it pushes a pixel density of 518 ppi, which is still among the sharpest in its class. Powering the internals is a familiar 14nm process Exynos Octa-Core processor that’s mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. The decision of using the same processor as the Galaxy S6 isn’t a bad thing considering it performed well and it is still the best performing processors out there at the moment. From our brief experience, the processor and the generous 4GB RAM combo combined promises a buttery smooth experience for the hardcore multi-taskers.  The S-Pen has been completely redesigned. Gone are the days where you need to pry the end with your fingernails as the Note 5 features an eject mechanism, popping up the end of the S-Pen with a light push. In the last Note 4, the S-Pen has doubled its pressure sensitivity to 2048 levels. On the new Note 5, Samsung claims to have improved the experience, making it as close to writing on paper.   Taking down notes is even faster on the Note 5 as you can start scribbling on the front display even while the screen is off. This saves time unlocking the device and finding the app to jot your notes down. The Air Command has been improved with more customisation and it allows you to add shortcuts to your favourite apps. As we move towards a digital office, there are some things that still require analog input. With the Note 5’s enhanced handwriting feature, you can now digitally sign PDF documents and have it sent out by email instantly. So you save time printing and re-scanning documents. Another neat feature is taking screenshots with its scroll capture. This allows you to capture a whole web page or a long chat message in a single action.  For those that still prefer to type on a tactile keyboard, Samsung has also released a Keyboard Cover which lets you type on a full QWERTY keyboard. The case is surprisingly thin and it lays over the touch screen covering the bottom portion of the device. There’s no batteries or bluetooth pairing required and it connects directly on the touch screen display. When not in use, you can move the keyboard towards its back cover.  The Galaxy Note 5 gets a 16MP f/1.9 main camera that’s assisted with optical image stabilisation and it is capable of shooting 4K videos. The front camera gets a 5MP f/1.9 unit, that’s also similar with the Galaxy S6. To launch the camera at any time, it is also triggered by double pressing on the home button. For great shots anytime, it has Auto HDR for both front and back cameras.  In terms of features, it gets better stabilisation for video and now there’s also an option to broadcast your moments live on YouTube. This isn’t new for a flagship smart phone but nevertheless it is a good option to have especially when you need to share an important moment in real time. Just make sure you’re in a location with fast upload speeds on 4G.  
For high speed downloads, the Note 5 supports 4G LTE up to Cat 9 speeds, where available. It also gets 802.11ac WiFi with MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC. Surprisingly Samsung has dropped its Infrared blaster, which has always being a standard feature on its previous flagships.  Health still remains one of Samsung’s key focus and it still retains a heart rate sensor module that also houses its camera’s LED flash. For the very first time in Malaysia, the Galaxy Note 5 will come with Dual-SIM slots, which is good news for globetrotters and mobile warriors that want to separate both personal and work lines.  Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports both fast charging by cable as well as wireless charging. Using compatible adaptive fast charge, it takes 90 minutes for a full charge. The Galaxy Note 5 has also improved its wireless charging speeds, with 0-100% being accomplished in 2 hours. Like the S6, it supports both wPC and PMA wireless charging standards.  The Galaxy Note 5 comes in four colours – White Pearl, Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Silver Titanium. US and Canada will be among the first in the world to get it starting next week 21st August, with the rest of the world to follow shortly after.  Some might argue that the Galaxy Note 5 is just an incremental upgrade from the Galaxy S6 but the winning formula is more than just better specs and a larger screen. For those who have gotten hooked to the S-Pen, the Galaxy Note 5 is a direct upgrade path with the top notch specs crafted in a premium package.  Want to get more things done with a bigger screen? The Galaxy Note 5 still offers one of the best multi-tasking features that have been perfected over the years. Granted that the previous TouchWiz were pretty bloaty, the new iteration is much lighter and certainly there’s still room for Samsung to improve. For those who are not convinced with the S-Pen in the previous model, you certainly should give this version a try.  Galaxy Note 5 Photo Gallery"

While the previous  Redmi Note  is seen as a cheap and good, the new version has moved the Redmi series up to the flagship league while maintaining its affordable price of under 1,000 CNY (RM625).  The Redmi Note 2 is much thinner, lighter and narrower than the previous Redmi Note thanks to its compact design and narrower bezels. It looks like a bigger  Mi 4i  and it has a 5.5″ IPS display which now pushes Full HD 1080p resolution. Overall, it is 8.25mm thin and weighs just 160 grams.  The Redmi Note 2 is definitely no slouch as it gets MediaTek’s 64-bit Helio X10 MT6795 Octa-Core processor, which is the same unit that’s powering the  Meizu MX5  and  HTC One M9+ . It consists of True 8x A53 cores that can run simultaneously.  There are 2 versions available – A standard Redmi Note 2 getting a 2.0GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB LPDDR3 RAM and 16GB of storage, while the Redmi Note 2 Prime has a higher clocked 2.2GHz Octa-Core processor with 2GB LPDDR3 RAM and 32GB of storage. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi Note 2 Prime scores over 54K on Antutu which even surpasses its own  Mi 4i  and  Mi Note  flagships.  For taking pictures, it not only gets a 13MP f/2.2 camera but it comes with Phase Detection Auto Focus that boast an ultra-fast 0.1 focus speeds. For the front it gets a 5MP shooter with Xiaomi’s own beautify mode. Also new for a Redmi series is an Infrared blaster which can be used as a universal remote. The Redmi Note 2 also comes with a microSD expansion slot and it is juiced up by a 3,060mAh removable battery that supports QuickCharge 2.0.  In terms of connectivity it has faster 802.11ac WiFi and it also supports dual-SIM cards with 4G LTE. At time of release, the Redmi Note 2 is still running on MIUI 6 but it will be upgraded to MIUI 7 eventually.  The Redmi Note 2 is priced at 799 CNY (RM499) for its China only TDD-LTE+TD-SCDMA variant, and 899 CNY (RM561) for its TDD-LTE + FDD-LTE version. Meanwhile the high-spec Redmi Note 2 Prime which supports both TDD-LTE and FDD-LTE standards is priced at 999 CNY (RM624). This is probably the  best smart phone under RM800  right now. The only question is how soon will it take for Xiaomi to release it in South East Asia.  For more info, you can check out the  Redmi Note 2  product page."

PIECE may be your solution – designed to look like a phone battery that is relatively the size of a credit card, this tiny device allows you to pop your second SIM card in and receive calls and text through your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0. Launched since the 27 th  of July, 2015, PIECE had already accomplished being 100% pledged in only 1 day. Since then, the company has tripled their initial funding and have promised an Android version on the way as well. PIECE currently only has plans to support GSM, EGSM, DCS and PCS SIMs; SIM types that are supported are Micro SIM and Nano SIM’s can be used through a PIECE adapter. The device is said to provide 150 hours of stand-by time but only 4 hours of call time on a single charge. Contacts on the other hand, will be accessed either from your SIM in PIECE or your contact list on your smart phone through the PIECE app. All calls and messages will run through the PIECE app and notable features include the ability to warn you, when your phone is getting out of range. This security alert trigger when your phone or device is 10 metres away from each other. As is meant to be designed small and with small things come those times when you can’t find them – this is why the creators gave an option to find either PIECE or your smart phone through the app or PIECE’s function key. Although being able to support calls and texts, the device will not support cellular data, a bummer to those wanting to use one line for calls/text and the other for only data. Users who don’t own a smart phone but an iOS device will be pleased to know that PIECE supports the iPod Touch and non-cellular iPad. Here’s the breakdown of the cost backing PIECE on Kickstarter: CAD $70 (RM 211) to CAD $80 (RM 241) – one PIECE (depending how quickly you back the project) CAD $80 (RM 241) to CAD $90 (RM 271) – one PIECE and one card holders (depending how quickly you back the project) CAD $120 (RM 361) – two PIECE CAD $140 (RM 421) – two PIECE and two card holders Shipping is an additional CAD $ 15 (RM 46) or CAD $20 (RM 61) depending which options you choose from the above. Businesses and potential retailers can also look out for the other larger orders available on the  Kickstarter page . The people behind PIECE aim to put out the device by November 2015. It should be warmed as with any crowd funding projects that there are risks involved and there have been times where projects fell apart and backers lost their money. Do ensure that you’re comfortable with the potential risk and lessen your worries by doing adequate research regarding the company and the product itself.   [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

On top of that, Celcom is also giving a 5 day pass to Celebrity Fitness to get your game on.    For a mere 6% off, it isn’t much considering you can get it cheaper from online retailers. Furthermore, the T&C also states that prices displayed do not include 6% GST, which is surprising considering Fitbit authorised retailers like  Harvey Norman  are selling them at the same price (before 6% discount) inclusive with GST.

Cheryl Bates,Alphabet spells new changes for Google,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/11/alphabet-spells-new-changes-for-google/,"alphabet,google,google alphabet,google inc",Industry in General,2015-08-11,"Google  is huge, and it’s due for some pretty big changes. One of which is its new inclusion in  Alphabet ; a new company who will be managing Google and all it associated products. This means that there will be an extra eye on Google as a company and Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies and according to Google the move was meant to make their operations cleaner and more accountable as they push new technologies like their glucose detecting smart contact lenses and  drone delivery service . This of course, will be affecting users on a more subtle level for now, but the new company wants to make a real difference in the long term view. So we might be seeing changes in the way Google operates (as they say this new Google is “slimmer” than it used to be) and perhaps even more growth as they are going to be focusing on pushing on potentials they already have. Alphabet Inc. will be replacing Google Inc. as will Google shares convert into the same number of shares for Alphabet, essentially making Google a wholly-owned subsidiary of said company. But don’t worry, all the apps we know and love will be staying the same for now. In terms of leadership, co-founder Larry Page will be the CEO of Alphablet Inc while Sergey Brin holds the President position. Meanwhile Sundar Pichai which used to head Android has now been appointed as CEO of Google Inc.   What do you think this big change will bring for Google? [ SOURCE ]"

Seeing much success in this area, the people behind Znaps, the Magnetic Adapter have envisioned the same but for your mobile devices. Consisting of two magnetic parts: the adapter (plugs into your existing cable’s connector) and the connector (stays in your device’s charging port). A simple solution that will attempt to lessen fraying, tripping and fiddling with your cables. Built initially for Micro USB and iOS’ lighting adapter only, the company has added a stretch goal of future-proof USB Type-C. All aforementioned goals have already been reached, with the company raking up an excess of $2.5 million Canadian Dollars so far in funding. One would wonder why Apple didn’t bother capitalising and licensing this technology much earlier but the folks at Znaps have refuted claims of patent infringement and possible suing – saying that this is why they didn’t create a cable mechanism, instead deploying custom adapters and connectors. Znaps aims to provide support for Quick Charge 2.0 giving it future-proofing factors in the long run. The nifty add-on will also let data transfers to function normally, as per usual cable and is seemingly compatible with other devices that use a Micro-USB, lighting and USB Type-C ports (power banks, laptops using USB Type-C, and other peripherals that require charging/data transfers) Cross-cable swapping (if that’s even a term) will be made easy – so basically you won’t be dictated by what cable you have, simply as long as you have the right adapter and the right connector to your device. Their pledging system has been plagued with complains, so Znaps has come up with a custom pledge calculator that’ll do the work for you. Prices will be reflected below ($1 CAD = RM 3.01) Delivery of the said product is estimated to arrive in November 2015 but as Kickstarter projects have flopped and been delayed before – like these cases:  OUYA ,  Coolest Cooler ,  DASH Wireless Smart in Earphones . You should always consider a risk when pledging and foresee delays and possibilities of a dud product, especially many concerns have been brought to light in the  comment section  of the Kickstarter page.

Alexander Wong,Samsung to expand its “Edge” features on the Galaxy S6 edge+,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/11/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-new-edge-features/,"Android,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus features,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-08-11,"When the  Galaxy S6 edge  was announced earlier this year, the extra “edge” screen wasn’t as useful as the  Galaxy Note Edge . With the phone actively in use, the edge display only functions as a People’s Edge, giving you instant shortcuts to 5 of your favourite contacts.  For the upcoming  Galaxy S6 edge+ , Samsung is extending its capabilities which goes beyond basic communications. According to a  source , the People’s Edge will get another layer of shortcuts which is just a swipe away as shown above. This allows you to customise 5 more shortcut icons for your favourite apps.  In addition, you can do more for each contact shortcut which is currently limited to Call, SMS and Email. For the new People’s Edge, you get 3 more actions which includes sending a photo, emoticon and to initiate a video chat. Personally, we felt that it would be better if Samsung offers more options such as sending an Instant Message via WhatsApp, WeChat or FB Messenger.  Like the current S6 edge, the new phablet version is expected to retain the same info stream that lets you peek on latest notifications and info panels when you swipe on the edge, while the screen is off. As usual, you also get to see who’s calling from its flashing preset colours while the phone is placed upside down. You can read up more about it in our  Galaxy S6 edge review .

Announced during Computex 2015 in Taiwan, the new Zenpads have a interchangable back cover which not only changes the looks but also adds functions as well.  The folks at ASUS Malaysia has invited the media for a sneak preview this coming Friday, and we expect the latest Zenpads to go on sale shortly after.  Just to recap, the ZenPad was  announced initially  with  ZenPad 8.0  and  ZenPad S 8.0 . Right after that, ASUS has expanded the line up with a cheaper  ZenPad C 7.0 ,  ZenPad 7.0  and a larger  ZenPad 10 . For the upcoming launch, we are likely to get the ZenPad 8.0 and the ZenPad S 8.0. The ZenPad 8.0 gets an 8″ 1280×800 display and under the hood you’ll find an Intel Atom X3 processor with either 1GB or 2GB of RAM. Meanwhile the ZenPad S 8.0 gets higher end specs which includes an 8″ 2048 x 1536 display, Intel’s Atom Z3580 processor with 4GB of RAM and it uses USB Type C.  Some of the interchangable back covers include a power case that extends your tablet’s battery life up to 15 hours and an audio cover that gives you a DTS 5.1 Surround Sound with its built-in 6 extra speakers. Also included with the Zenpad S 8.0 is a Z-Stylus that has a 1.2mm writing tip and it works quite similar to Samsung’s S-Pen from the Note series.  Just earlier last week, ASUS Malaysia has quietly released its budget friend  ZenPad C 7.0  that’s priced at RM499. While it looks like a bargain, the specs are quite underwhelming when compared to  FonePad 7  that offers 2GB RAM and better cameras.

A much anticipated refresh of the  Samsung Note  series will be unveiled tomorrow. Taking place in the Big Apple itself, it’ll also feature the newer and bigger  Galaxy S6 edge+ .  Introduced  4 years ago , the Galaxy Note series had created a whole new phablet category, promising a tablet-like experience in a smart phone form factor. With a 5.3″ screen, it was considered quite huge during its time and most flagship smart phones are at least 5.5 inches these days. Can Samsung maintain its phablet king status in its 5th generation? Here’s the stuff we know about the Galaxy Note 5 / S6 edge+ and it’s quite a mouthful. Practically everything has already been leaked but the weight of this information should always be taken with a grain of salt to ensure no disappointment. For the Note 5, we’ve seen mock-ups,  prototypes , benchmarks and even the  packaging !  Not short on building the hype for the actual device, which is assumed to carry either a 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor or a better Exynos 7422 with an all-in-one chip solution. Screen size will stick to the 5.7-inch footprint and utilise its own Super AMOLED display technology with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 (Quad HD). Performance will be helped along with an ample amount of RAM at 4GB and internal storage will cap off at 32GB. Some will be put-off by omitting the microSD option but will take comfort in the S-pen being improved to auto-eject through a spring loaded mechanism. Some sources go on to say that the device will be as heavily skinned as previous iterations, as TouchWiz and S-pen apps will be taking the load from the 4GB, leaving probably about only half left to be used. Snapping photos will be made using a 16-megapixel rear shooter that takes advantage of OIS feature and the front will be a decent 5-megapixel sensor, similar to its current Galaxy S6. In terms of battery capacity, the Galaxy Note 5 is said to be having a 3,000mAh capacity battery that’s non-removable. Just like the Galaxy S6, the battery is smaller than its predecessors but Samsung reckons that its frugal Exynos processor and Universal Flash Storage would sip less power.   Skimming only halfway through, we’ve yet to mention the Galaxy S6 edge+. Design aesthetics will not be much to rave about for the S6 edge+ will retain the same design as the S6 edge, just a slight increase in its width and length (obviously being a 5.7-inch display). The processor is likely to be the same Exynos 7420 powerhouse but it gets 4GB of RAM just like the Note 5. The battery is expected to be similar with the Note 5, housing a 3,000mAh capacity unit that’s embedded into its unibody form.  The double edge display will also be  updated  with more features so you can use it for more than just contacting your 5 favourite contacts. For better productivity, Samsung is expected to introduce a  Keyboard Cover  accessory which turns the S6 edge+ into a full QWERTY typing machine. A  recent leak  indicates that the keyboard add-on would cost 60 Euros, or approximately RM263 when converted directly.  For those juggling between 2 mobile plans, the new Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ are very likely to come with  dual-SIM  support as spotted recently on our SIRIM certification database. While there’s no microSD expansion slots, there are those who are hoping that Samsung might allow you to pop-in a microSD card onto the 2nd SIM slot just like its current  Galaxy A8 . Though all this information has come out, we’ve yet to hear anything about the price range of the two devices. Based on past launch prices of these devices, we’ll attempt to speculate the range of Samsung’s newest additions: Looking at how Samsung priced their previous models and considering GST has kicked in, we reckon that the Galaxy Note 5 could be priced around RM 2,699, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ hovers above the RM 3,100 mark. Definitely they are not going to be cheap but it is still more affordable than the iPhone 6 Plus that’s priced at RM3,126 for its base 16GB model. With 2 new flagship phones, we expect Samsung to slash prices of its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge by about RM200-300 and this is  taking place  worldwide. In terms of availability, the Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+ could go on sale as early as end of this month. For Malaysia, we reckon both models could go on sale in  early September .  Leaks were abundant with the two devices but Samsung has also teased us with the  unpacked teaser  with a mysterious third device. Fresh on their Samsung Tab S2 launch, could this mean Samsung might add another tablet to its line-up? If you want to get up-to-date information on it do follow us on our  Twitter account  as we will be reporting live from Samsung Unpacked 2015 at New York. It’s happening at 11:00PM (local time) this Thursday, 13th August."

With the release of the  Zenfone 2 , they have renewed its partnership with the latest range of Atom processors including its 2.3GHz Quad-Core Z3580 processor that comes with an epic serving of 4GB RAM. At yesterday’s Zen Festival event in New Delhi, ASUS has announced a new Zenfone 2 Laser line up that runs on Qualcomm’s processors instead. To make it stand out from the current Zenfone 2, it gets an extra Laser AF feature, hence the “Laser” moniker. This allows the camera to focus onto subjects as quick as 0.3 seconds especially under low light. Meanwhile the design is still unmistakably a Zenfone 2 with a curve back and a rear mounted volume rocker. Typical of ASUS, the Zenfone 2 Laser comes in 4 different variants with various screen size ranging from 5 to 6 inches. It starts with the ZE500KG and ZE500KL that comes with a 5″ HD 720p display. The ZE500KG is the lowest denominator as it supports dual-SIMs with just 3G HSPA+ connectivity. It runs a 1.2GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor that’s mated with 2GB of RAM and it comes with either 8GB or 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD. For imaging, it gets an 8MP f/2.0 rear shooter with Laser AF and PixelMaster technology. Meanwhile the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 selfie shooter. Powering the device is a 2,070 mAh battery and it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with its ZenUI. The ZE500KL is similar with the ZE500KG but it is slightly better with support for 4G LTE and has a higher resolution 13MP f/2.0 main camera. Another difference is the battery where it is listed to come with either a 2,070mAh unit or a larger 2,400mAh option. These models would compete directly with the likes of the  Redmi 2  that are priced under RM500. Moving up a notch is the 5.5″ Zenfone 2 Laser which is likely to be the popular choice. The front display is a larger 5.5″ size with a HD 720p resolution and accompanying it is a generous 3,000mAh capacity battery. Under the hood, it is the same story with a Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. It also comes with the same 13MP f/2.0 and 5MP f/2.0 camera combo, dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB cards. For those wanting a bigger screen like the former  Zenfone 6 , there’s also a 6 inch variant and it gets beefier specs with a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. Unlike the previous models, the 6″ ZE601KL gets a Full HD (1920×1080) display for greater clarity. Apart from these upgrades, the rest of the device is the same including its 3,000mAh capacity battery. This could be an affordable alternatives to the larger phablets in the market like the  OPPO R7 Plus  and  Huawei Ascend Mate 7 . The ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser series is an alternative to the current Intel-powered Zenfone 2 line up. Between the 2, the current Zenfone 2 seems to be the better option with more RAM, storage and it offers a higher Full HD resolution on its 5.5″ models. In terms of performance, the Intel Z3580 processor has  proven to be superior  than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 801 processors. Since the Zenfone brand is often associated being cheap and good, the price would be the main deciding factor. The obvious compromise is its lower HD 720p screen resolution especially on the 5.5″ Zenfone 2 Laser model but ASUS tries to make up for it in the imaging department by fitting a Laser AF. For more info, you can check out the respective ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser  ZE500KG ,  ZE500KL  and  ZE550KL  pages. Which would you pick? The Intel based Zenfone 2 or the Qualcomm powered Zenfone 2 Laser?

It’ll be sad however, that only a limited number of units will make its way to our waters on the 12 th  of August of this year. Booming sales in China with one million units sold in July 2015 alone, has made OPPO confident that those figures can be replicated locally. Claimed to be OPPO’s version of the flagship killer, the R7 will be priced in between the R7 Lite and R7 Plus, which cost RM 1,298 and RM 1,998 respectively. Coming in either Gold or Silver options, the R7 will include the same processors as the other phones in its family tree – a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor. Multitasking users will be pleased with the 3GB of RAM in the device but internal storage is limited to only 16 GB. Fret not, as the device does support a microSD card, up to 128 GB but that will utilise your nano sim slot on this dual SIM phone. The display fits the 5-inch norm in today’s mobile world and is capable of Full HD (1920 x 1080 resolution) at 445 pixels per inch. Energy will be supplied by a 2320 mAh battery, which will be VOOC flash charging enabled. Camera optics, on the other hand are supported by a 13-megapixel (rear) and 8-megapixel (front) sensors and comes with OPPO’s existing slew of camera features.

As comparison, the standard Pebble Time with a silicon strap is  priced  at US$199 (about RM777).  The Pebble Time Steel isn’t the same Pebble Time with a metal body attached on a fancier strap. While the Pebble Time still does 7 days of battery life with its colour e-paper display, the steel version has a slightly larger battery allowing up to 10 days of use on a single charge. The watch frame is crafted with a CNC-finished 316L stainless steel which is similar material used by the Apple Watch (Stainless Steel Case). For better durability of the screen, it also gets Gorilla Glass protection at the front.

According to MyDrivers, the Redmi Note 2 was spotted on the Mi online store at 799 CNY (about RM504). What’s more interesting is that it carries 32GB of storage which pretty generous considering the last model only came with 8GB. As spotted on China’s  TEENA listing , the Redmi Note 2 still maintains a 5.5″ display but this time it pushes a Full HD 1080p resolution.  Powering the device is a 2.0GHz processor (possibly MediaTek MT6795) that’s mated with 2GB of RAM. On the certification listing, it gets 16GB of storage, so it is likely that there are multiple storage options available. For taking pics, it gets a 13MP camera at the back, while the front gets a 5MP shooter which is similar to the current Mi 4i. Like the recent Mi smart phones, it will come with dual-SIM slots supporting 4G LTE. If Xiaomi sells this for under RM700, this would definitely give the  Meizu M2 Note  a run for its money.

Home-grown Exynos processors make an appearance and have been leading the way to better performance of our Samsung portable devices. Samsung might prove doubters wrong that every new generation, beckons the need for better performance; justifying the similar Exynos 7420 making a reappreance. Reusing the same processor as the old guard isn’t a totally horrible idea, as it continues to top AnTuTu benchmarks with over 67,000 points. The Galaxy S6 edge’s double edge display now gets a +, stretching the screen to phablet stardom at 5.7-inches. We might have a bigger screen but the other innards are all the same, except for a bigger battery. When the Galaxy S6 edge was first introduced, it came with a couple of features including a People’s Edge which brings your 5 favourite contacts closer to you. With the S6 edge+, they have enhanced this further with Apps Edge which allows you to put 5 app shortcuts within a thumb’s reach. In addition, the edge features are now accessible in any screen interface, instead of being limited to just the home screen. Even though internally it is very much the same but the introduction of the new Keyboard Cover accessory further enhances the typing experience on a large smart phone – giving it a more ergonomic feel that could possibly please die hard BlackBerry users. The Galaxy Note 5 is a similar device with the Galaxy S6 edge+, offering a 5.7″ Quad HD display and a similar Exynos Octa-Core processor with 4GB of RAM. The S-Pen is the key differentiation in the Galaxy Note series and already in its fifth generation, we’ve seen a steady progression of innovation. From AirView during the beginning to an extension of features which includes Action Memo, Screen Write and increasing pressure sensitivity. The Note 5 promises to bring a stylus experience to another level – touting it to be a close second to writing on paper. Accompanying the S-Pen’s housing silo which now has a push to eject mechanism will be the standard micro USB charging port. But if you’re not into cables, you could make use of its built-in wireless charging properties of the device which is similar to the Galaxy S6. You’ll get a 0% to 100% charge with the cable in 90 minutes with Adaptive Fast Charging, while wireless charging takes a little longer – 120 minutes for a full charge. Optimisation of the TouchWiz will be influential in keeping the lights on the 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screened phablet that pushes a pixel density 518 ppi. That latest battery-friendly Exynos processor and 4GB RAM might help and hopefully won’t stump the 3,000mAh battery too much as the older Note 4 survived quite well on a battery larger by 220mAh. Encased in metal and glass, the Note 5 will be thinner and among the lightest Note ever, weighing just 169g. For imaging we’ll see a familiar 16-megapixel sensor on the back with Optical Image Stabilisation coupled with a 5-megapixel front camera. Moving on to another sensory experience, the Note 5 will return with UHQ audio capabilities which helps to upscale low bit audio to a higher quality. Probably the biggest omission on the new Note would be a microSD slot and a removable battery, a trend which is slowly disappearing with flagship smart phones today. Both phablets will be making their way to our shores with dual-SIM enabled, catering to those who prefer to have one mobile devices for work and their social life. Also included as standard is its signature heart rate sensor and a capacitive home button that doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. In terms of availability, it is expected to go on sale in Malaysia as early as first week of September. For a closer look, check out our first impressions of the  Galaxy Note 5  and  Galaxy S6 edge+ ."
Alexander Wong,Samsung is making a QWERTY Keyboard cover for the Galaxy S6 edge+?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/08/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-qwerty-keyboard-cover/,"Android QWERTY Keyboard,evleaks,Keyboard Cover,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus keyboard,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung keyboard cover,Samsung QWERTY Keyboard cover,Samsung Unpacked 2015","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-08-08,"With pressure mounting on Samsung’s latest flagship, it appears that they are throwing everything, but the kitchen sink. Since the  Galaxy S6 edge+  is merely a bigger screen version of its  S6 edge , Samsung could be adding more productivity features that could even please the hardcore BlackBerry users.  Serial leakster @evleaks has posted a picture of a Keyboard Cover accessory that gives the S6 edge+ a full QWERTY typing experience. This looks like a  add-on Typo keyboard  for the iPhone, that was short-lived due to lawsuits by BlackBerry. The keyboard covers up the bottom portion of the device and it offers the typical 3 Android buttons for Recent Apps, Home and Back. It does look interesting but the overall solution does look bulky considering this is a phablet category device. Furthermore with the attachment in place, we wonder if there’s another fingerprint sensor on the add-on keyboard since the home button has been covered fully.  If you love the tactile feel of a physical keyboard, this may be your cup of tea and it has been a long time since we saw a new Android device with a full keyboard. But we are not too sure about the size though and already we felt that the BlackBerry Passport is too huge for our liking.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
Arif Lee,Is this the Huawei Ascend Mate 8?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/10/is-this-the-huawei-ascend-mate-8/,"Ascend,Ascend Mate 7 Mini,evleaks,huawei,Huawei Ascend Mate 8,IFA,IFA 2015,leak,Mate 8,rumour","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill",2015-08-10,"Praised to be one of the top credible leakers of mobile devices, Evan Blass or @evleaks, as he’s commonly known, gives us a glimpse of the soon-to-be latest Huawei device – the Ascend Mate 8. Blass goes on to state that Huawei will go on to launch this device during IFA 2015, on the 2 nd  of September. Based on the design language and timing of the launch, this could very well mean that their latest device will take over the current 6-inch  Mate 7  phablet but conflicting reports say otherwise. Media correspondents from China are claiming this could be Huawei’s stab at a smaller screened device. Slated to include a 4.7-inch screen that pushes 1920 x 1080 pixels, the device will run a Kirin Octa-core processor and have a Mali-T624 graphics on-board – based on information from AnTuTu’s benchmark site. If the aforementioned specs leave you quite disappointed, you’ll be happy to hear the opposing rumours of the latest device. Considering that the Mate 7 utilised the latest and greatest processor at its time of release, if it were to be the Mate 8 that arrives, it’ll potentially feature a yet to be seen Kirin 950 processor. The processor in question will be capable of clock speeds that max out at 2.4GHz, which is promising. This means it could definitely give the Snapdragon 810 and the Exynos 7420 a run for its money. All of this numbers are only in theory, nothing has be shown in practice yet but the 64-bit processor will support 4K video, USB 3.0 transfers, LPDDR4 RAM , and a i7 co-processor for sensor hub and security processing. Audio-enthusiasts will also be awed at the processor’s dedicated DSP audio co-processor (Tensilica Hi-Fi 4 DSP). However, don’t jump the gun yet, as they are only rumours and leaks. As IFA draws closer, surely more information will come to light and we’ll have to see whether it’ll be a Mate 7 Mini or the beastly Mate 8. [  IMAGE SOURCE ,  SOURCE ,  2 ,  3  ]"
Alexander Wong,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ with Dual-SIM spotted on Malaysian SIRIM database,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/10/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-dual-sim-malaysia-sirim/,"Android,Dual Sim,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus Malaysia,Samsung Glaxy S6 edge plus dual sim,Samsung Unpacked 2015","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-08-10,"It looks like Samsung Malaysia is definitely jumping on the Dual-SIM bandwagon for its upcoming flagships. Following the  SIRIM certification  of its  Galaxy Note 5  with dual-SIMs, its  Galaxy S6 edge+  sibling has also gotten the same green light with dual-SIM slots on board. The spotted Galaxy S6 edge+ for Malaysia carries the model number SM-G9287C, and it joins other S6 siblings that carried the model number SM-G920F for the S6 and SM-G925F for the S6 edge. The Galaxy Note 5 (SM-N9208) was  mysteriously removed  from  SIRIM ‘s listing a few days after its discovery. Just to recap on the purported specs, the Galaxy S6 edge+ comes with a double curve screen which scales up to 5.7 inches like the Galaxy Note 5. Internally it is pretty much the same as the current S6 edge except for 4GB of RAM and a larger 3,000mAh capacity. Like the current S6 edge, there’s no removable battery but some are speculating that the dual-SIM slot might offer a hybrid microSD/2nd SIM card option.  From the earlier  leaked photos , the IR Blaster is missing from the top but this could be an early prototype which could turn out differently in the final product. While the S6 edge+ lacks the productivity S-Pen from the Note series, an interesting  keyboard accessory  was spotted which could give the device a full QWERTY typing experience. It appears that Dual-SIMs are becoming mainstream even on the high-end models. What used to be a staple of most entry-level devices, a significant number of new flagship models released this year were dual-SIM ready including the Huawei P8, Sony Xperia Z3+, Xiaomi Mi Note and HTC One E9+. The Galaxy S6 edge+ will be launching this coming Thursday, together with the Galaxy Note 5 and a new tablet.   SIRIM Certification"

If endurance is what you seek, they have just announced the ASUS Zenfone Max, a new mid-ranger that comes with a huge 5,000mAh capacity battery. 
 Like the mainstream Zenfone 2 models, it has a 5.5″ IPS display that pushes a modest HD 720p resolution and it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor mated to 2GB of RAM. For storage it gets 16GB of storage which is expandable via microSD. For taking pictures it gets a similar kit as the ZenFone Laser with a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with dual-tone LED lens and it is further assisted with Laser AutoFocus. The front gets a 5MP f/2.0 shooter for selfie duties. It also supports 4G LTE with dual-SIMs and out of the box it runs on Android 5.0 with the latest ZenUI 2.0. In terms of availability, the Zenfone Max will go on sale in October but they have yet to give any price indications at the moment.  With a battery capacity this large, you probably could go more than 2 days on a single charge. Overall this is better spec’ed and it looks better than  ZTE Q519T . If you value long battery life above having top end specs, the Zenfone Max is definitely worth considering.   [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Initially launched with just 1GB RAM and 8GB of storage, those who need a little more can step up with the ASUS ZenFone C Enhanced version that offers twice the amount of RAM and Storage for RM399. That’s just a mere RM60 extra over the current  standard model  that’s priced at RM339 on DirectD.   The rest of the specs remain unchanged with a 4.5″ 854×480 display that’s toughen with Gorilla Glass 3. It gets the same dual-core 1.2GHz Intel Atom Z2520 processor, which is also powering the  Zenfone 4 . For the enhanced version, you get 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which is also expandable with microSD up to 64GB. For snapping pics and videos is a 5MP f/2.0 main camera with LED flash and the front is a basic VGA resolution snapper. The battery is a 2,100mAh capacity unit which is removable. In terms of connectivity, the Zenfone C is a dual-SIM device but it only supports 3G with HSPA+ speeds. Out of the box, it still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat with its own ZenUI running on top.  For RM399, the ASUS Zenfone 2 enhanced version cheaper than the  Honor 3C  and  Redmi 2 enhanced  version. However it is a step back in the display department and if you can afford a little more, you could get a smart phone with a HD 720p display and with 4G support like the Redmi 2.

Its purported retail packaging in shrink wrap has appeared online and it gives us some confirmation on what to expect with their next big thing. In terms of design, it is the same as the Galaxy S6/S6 edge with a plain looking box with Galaxy Note 5 written in its new Galaxy font. Interestingly the Note 5 is spelled with “Note5″ without a space in between. At the back, the specs follows what we’ve seen so far which includes a 64-bit Octa-Core processor, 4GB of RAM and a 5.7″ Quad HD AMOLED display. The cameras are similar with a 16MP OIS main + 5MP front camera like the S6 and it also comes with Wireless Charging built-in as standard.  Just to recap, the Galaxy Note 5 will continue their new premium approach of using metal and glass materials for its body. As seen  previously , the back features a curve glass that’s very much like the  Mi Note . For the S-Pen stylus, it stows flushly into the metal frame and it appears to be ejectable with a slight push. For Malaysia, we could be getting a Dual-SIM variant as  spotted  recently on our Malaysian SIRIM database. If you’re seeking for a different type of display, the Note 5 will be announced together with the S6 edge+, which is basically a phablet version of the current S6 edge. While the hardware is basically the same under the hood, it gets updated with 4GB of RAM and has a much bigger battery. Another surprise at this week’s launch is a  3rd device  which could be a new tablet. Keep it locked on to SoyaCincau.com as we will be reporting live from Samsung Unpacked 2015 at New York. It’s happening at 11:00PM this Thursday, 13th August.  [  SOURCE  ]"

Speculators have come to a conclusion that it’s definitely an  Honor 7  coming our way. A device that  sold out  (200,000 units) in just 2 minutes in China, it could possibly give other mid-range competitors a good fight locally. Making an appearance in SIRIM Malaysia’s database as PLK-L01 as of yesterday, further fuels that the device will arrive soon enough, with no tentative date that we can tell for now. As a rough indication for European markets, there has been rumours that the device will make an appearance in September during IFA 2015. Power-packed for its price the Honor 7 features a 5.2-inch 1080p Full HD display and retails (China market) in 3 versions. The lowest – 16GB internal storage and LTE, middle option – 16GB and dual-SIM LTE and the top end model – 64GB and the same dual-SIM LTE. No mention if these will be the same variants that make it to Malaysia but it’ll be a rough indication what to expect. Aside from all the cellular and internal memory differences, all 3 share a Kirin 935 processor that has 8 cores: 4 high powered running at 2.2GHz and 4 efficient cores clocked at 1.5GHz. While, those on a strict budget can opt for the more affordable 16GB dual-SIM LTE model but make use of the MicroSD slot that is available on all variants. Camera bugs who emphasise on pixels will be pleased with a 20-megapixel Sony sensor protruding out of the back of the smart phone, while a decent 8-megapixel shutter makes up the front. The Honor 7 will also come with a fingerprint scanner for biometric security functionality. 3GB of RAM gives the device ample memory to handle multitasking on the distinctive EMUI 3.1 overlay of Android 5.0 Lollipop. To cap off, juicing all these internals will be a 3100mAh battery that is non-removable. Do let us know if you’re excited about likeliness of the Honor 7 coming our way in the comments below.

It gets 4GB of LP-DDR3 RAM and its storage can be further expanded with microSD up to 128GB extra if required. No surprises with the rest of the spec sheet as it retains the same 13MP main and 5MP front cameras as the Zenfone 2 and keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh non-removable battery.

This yet again confirms what we’ve seen in the  last few weeks  and it doesn’t stray away from the Galaxy S6/S6 edge design language. If you’re definitely putting your money on one of these new flagships, you can now order your case from Spigen with shipping expected to start from 1st September for selected models.  Just to recap, both phablet models are expected to run on the same benchmark topping Exynos 7420 processor with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM with the Note 5 retaining a 5.7″ Quad HD display. Following the S6, both the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ are almost certain to come without any expandable microSD slot and the unibody design also means that the battery is also non-removable. The cameras from the S6 are likely to be retained, which includes a 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front keeps its 5MP selfie shooter that supports wide selfie.  There won’t be any “Note Edge” this time around. If you’re looking for a device with a unique screen to show off, you’ll have the S6 edge+ which is basically the phablet version of the curent S6 edge.

Portability will play a big role in its 2-in-1 segment and weighing in at 1.5 kg may hinder that, in comparison the Surface 3 + type cover comes in under 1 kg .IO ports seem reasonable with USB 2.0 and 3.0 on board. Also included is a HDMI output, Ethernet port and a useful SD card-reader. The device is also WiFi and Bluetooth friendly so moving it around should cause no worry when it comes to connectivity. Considering the device will come with 4GB of DDR3L RAM, 500GB of internal storage and an Intel Pentium quad-core processor, it’ll have a decent spec sheet for a small device. Given the entry price point of RM 1,499 convertible, the new Acer Aspire R 11 could possibly give the  Microsoft Surface 3  a run for its money. Interested in picking it up?

We know that Samsung will be launching its  Galaxy Note 5  and  Galaxy S6 edge+ , but a recent teaser suggests that there will be a third device to be announced as well. Spotted on Samsung Philippines’  NextisNow  microsite, the extra device looks like a tablet of about 7-8 inches. Above it are obviously the Galaxy S6 edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5. Since Samsung has just launched its  Galaxy Tab S2 , it is weird for them to announce another  high-end tablet . It could be another new Note Tablet like the  Note 8.0  and  Note 10.1 , but it is unlikely since there isn’t any indication of an S-Pen in the teaser. There are speculations that Samsung might introduce a Tab “edge” tablet featuring a curved display, just because they can. With  declining tablet sales , is there really a need for yet another Galaxy tablet? If there’s one more product that Samsung should announce, it would be a new smart watch since the Gear 2 and Gear Fit wearables are about a year and a half year old, while the Gear S is almost a year old. The Samsung  Gear A  is to be their first round smart watch and it is expected to come with a unique  rotating bezel ring . All shall be revealed next week.

Following the  launch  of its  ZenPad tablet  series, ASUS has also introduced an entry-level version that’s called the ZenPad C 7.0 and it has now arrived on our shores. The ZenPad C 7.0 is an affordable 7″ Dual-SIM 3G tablet which allows you to make phone call, and it carries a price tag of RM499. The front gets a 7″ IPS display that does a modest 1024×600 pixels resolution and it runs on Intel’s new Atom x3-C3230 Quad-Core processor. It gets just 1GB of RAM and for Malaysia, we are getting 16GB of storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 64GB.  At the back it gets a leather pattern like design and at the top corner, it gets a rather basic 2MP camera. Over at the front, you’ll find a simple VGA camera and there’s a loud speaker upfront for optimal audio playback.  In comparison with its higher-spec  FonePad 7 FE171CG  (now priced at RM569 with GST), the ZenPad C 7.0 gets a newer processor but it only offers 1GB instead of 2GB RAM that’s being offered on the FonePad 7. If you take photos on a tablet, the FonePad 7 would be better as it has higher 8MP PixelMaster main camera while selfies are taken by its 2MP front camera.  The ZenPad C 7.0 is quite light at 265 grams and has a thickness of 8.4mm. At time of release, it runs on a newer Android 5.0 Lollipop along with its custom ZenUI.

Announced  quietly  last month, the Galaxy Tab S2 is their thinnest and lightest tablet yet at 5.6mm and it weighs from just 265g (Tab S2 8.0 WiFi). The local tech media will be invited for a preview this week but retailer SenHeng has published its retail price along with its bundled freebies. The Galaxy Tab S2 comes in 2 sizes – a compact 8.0 incher and a full size 9.7″ version, both of which are now having a 4:3 display aspect ratio, that’s similar to the iPad. For the Malaysian market, we are getting only the 4G LTE versions.  Compared to the previous Galaxy Tab S, the new version gets a dip in display with a Retina Display-like 2048×1536 pixels resolution, instead of a Quad HD 2560×1600 resolution. Under the hood, it gets an Exynos 5433 Octa-Core (Quad 1.9GHz + Quad 1.3GHz) processor mated to 3GB of RAM, which is the same powerhouse as the Galaxy Note 4. In terms of storage, we are getting 32GB on board which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB.  Don’t expect anything fancy with the camera as it gets a 8MP main unit and a front facing 2.1MP shooter. Out of the box, it runs on a more current Android 5.0 Lollipop and keeping the lights on is a 4,000mAh capacity battery for the 8 inch version, while the bigger 9.7″ tablet gets a 5,870mAh capacity unit.  In terms of price, it is quite similar with the previous version with the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 going for RM1,699, while the Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 is priced at RM1,999. Based on SenHeng’s listing, they are throwing in 12 months free  iflix  subscription, Milk Music streaming service and a free Bluetooth Speaker worth RM129. Stocks are said to be available by mid August.  It is also worth mentioning that the new Tab S2 comes with 32GB of storage, which is double of what was  offered  on the first gen Galaxy Tab S. Like the previous version, the Tab S2 also supports telephony functions such as calls and SMS.  [  SOURCE  ]"

China’s uprising brand Xiaomi will be having an event of their own which focuses on the software side of things. As shown above, it will be their MIUI 7, their latest iteration of its custom ROM. It has been a year since MIUI 6 was  introduced  with a clean and flat interface, which looks heavily inspired by  iOS 7 . The current MIUI 6 was originally based on Android 4.4 KitKat and most recently it supports Android 5.0 Lollipop on their new  Mi 4i  smart phone. While it is Lollipop underneath, it doesn’t feature any of the Material Design elements that came as standard on most devices.  Looking at the “7” teaser, Xiaomi might just incorporate some of the flat Material Design appearance this time around and it will be likely based on the current Android 5.1.1. With  Android M  expected to go live by end of this year, Xiaomi seriously needs to look beyond just Lollipop. In terms of availability, their current flagships like the Mi Note and Mi 4i could be among the first to get it before it trickles down to the rest of its Redmi family. Will Xiaomi announce a new device? It might be possible but we are not expecting a Mi 5 flagship anytime soon, at least for this quarter.    [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

This comes after Microsoft successfully launched the mature version of Windows 10, albeit some raised eyebrows on their stance of  user privacy . The model numbers of the 950 line were still vague in the past – purported to continue with the 940 after the current-gen 930 flagship but  this article  says Microsoft might skip one number ahead. Codenamed the Cityman, the device has been rumoured to be phablet sized, a 6-inch screen running at 2K (Quad HD) resolution to be precise. It will allegedly run a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor and be paired with 3GB of RAM for speedy performance. Internal storage is said to be 32GB but those who need more can opt for the microSD expansion. The shutters will be a 20-megapixel Pureview (back) and 5-megapixel (front), the former equip with a three LED flash. Powering the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is a 3,300 mAh removable battery and USB Type-C will be the port of choice. We hope Windows 10 Mobile will tone down the privacy intrusions or at least be more forward about it and allow users to change the settings easily. In the past, the device has been said to be revealed at a grand announcement sometime in October, and be out on the shelves in November. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Essentially this is the same Passport as before with a squarish 4.5″ screen that does 1440×1440 pixels resolution along with a 3-row keyboard that doubles up as a trackpad. The internals remained unchanged with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.  The difference is on the exterior where it gets a “ Porsche Design “-like appearance without the crazy price tag. It is supposed to be a premium upgrade over the current Passport with a stainless steel frame with rounded corners. The back gets a textured pattern for better grip and the camera lens now has a ring element that protects it from scratches. The keyboard also gets some subtle improvements for better typing while on the go. And you get all of these for an extra US$50 over the standard BlackBerry Passport.  The optics are the same as well with a 13MP f/2.0 main camera with Optical Image Stabilisation, while the front gets a 2MP fixed focus camera. Powering the device is a 3450mAh non-removable battery that is rated to last 30 hours of average use. When compared with the earlier Passport, the Silver Edition is taller and wider but it is slightly thinner at 9.25mm (Passport: 9.30mm). It is heavier at 205 grams, in comparison to the original Passport that weighs 196 grams.  The BlackBerry Passport Silver Edition available now in the US at US$549 (about RM2,126) and they are giving out US$130 worth of accessories if purchased directly from their  online store . For BlackBerry fans in Malaysia, it should be heading to Malaysia soon since it was  certified under SIRIM  earlier last month. For more info, you can check out the  BlackBerry Passport  page."

For those who are clueless about how the next flagship phablet  would look like , the folks at Droid-Life has gotten a fresh batch of hands-on pictures for your viewing pleasure. Nothing has changed from what we’ve seen earlier as it gets a metal frame with glass on both sides just like the Galaxy S6. At the back, it gets a sloping curve on both edges which is similar to the  Xiaomi Mi Note’s  3G Glass for its back. As expected from Samsung, the new Galaxy Note 5 lacks a microSD slot and a removable battery, just like most flagships today. For the Malaysian market, we are expected to receive a  dual-SIM version  which is good news for those with multiple telco subscriptions.  Looking at the bottom, the S-Pen sits flush with the metal frame, which leads us to believe that it will offer a push to eject mechanism.  It is worth pointing out that the S-Pen is now placed on the right, instead on the left side like its previous generations.  From the screen above, Samsung has updated the new TouchWiz interface for the S-Pen and it looks like you could customise the shortcuts that appears when the S-Pen is taken out from its slot. Looking at the top. the infrared blaster appears to have been omitted and this could be bad news for those relying on their phones as a universal remote.  The bottom of the Note 5 is the same the Galaxy S6 with a headphone jack and a drilled speaker grill. There’s no fancy USB Type C connector as it retains the usual microUSB 2.0 port with adaptive fast charging supported. We also expect the Galaxy Note 5 to support wireless charging natively without extra cases, just like the S6.  To recap on the specs, the Galaxy Note 5 is predicted to carry the same Exynos 7420 Octa-Core processor as the Galaxy S6, but it gets 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM along with storage options starting from 32GB. The camera is likely to carry the same 16MP + 5MP camera combo and keeping the lights on is said to be a 3,000mAh capacity unit, which is even smaller than the  Galaxy Note II  (3,100mAh).  The Galaxy Note 4 was launched in Malaysia at RM2,499 and judging from the Galaxy S6 RM2,599 retail price, do expect to fork out more for a Note 5 this year. Hopefully it isn’t as insane as the iPhone 6 Plus that starts from RM3,126 for a mere 16GB of storage.  Live photos of the Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ appear

Arif Lee,This may be the reason why Windows 10 is free to upgrade – it’s tracking your every move,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/04/this-may-be-the-reason-why-windows-10-is-free-to-upgrade-its-tracking-your-every-move/,"Download Windows 10,launch,microsoft,Microsoft Windows,Microsoft Windows 10,operating system,Upgrade Windows 10,Windows,Windows 10,Windows 10 Privacy,Windows 7,Windows 8,Windows 8.1","Industry in General,Microsoft,Mobile Devices,Others",2015-08-04,"Users are not going to like it, especially those who bought their copies.  Windows 10  is secretly selling your personal data, probably not even letting you know barring some fine print hidden in their T&Cs. Previously, when we ran the  Windows 10 update seeding story  we thought it would be the end of that, well other than the articles about the WiFi Sense feature. We were wrong. Microsoft has announced since  early this year  that Windows 10 would be free to upgrade, within one year of its launching for those running Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. One can draw a conclusion that their new strategy would be bombarding Windows 10 users with targeted ads. Verging on intrusive to say the least, Microsoft’s Windows 10 has fairly distrustful monitoring that includes watching your locational movements, any info from messages, calendars and even going through your contact list. Anyone who wants to dig deep into the  privacy  and  service agreement , feel free to do so but to simplify things, the OS will associate you to a unique advertising ID that is tied to your e-mail address. In turn, tailoring ads specific to your usage of your device. Usage of Cortana will further intensify the harvesting of your personal information. Though, the likeliness of you ever noticing this breech of privacy will be low, as it’ll appear in Windows Store apps – a newly launched venture that hasn’t picked up much traction, yet. As sinister as all this is, there are a handful of settings you can tweak to limit the amount of personal data leaking out on the inter-webs. 
 Officially, it’ll take a lot of tweaking and reading to fully understand what settings will exactly serve what purpose but if you’re absolutely sure about not wanting anything to get out, you can just set everything to “no”. The case is much easier for those who have yet to install Windows 10, just ensure you decline the “Express setting” and take your time to set the options yourself manually. Do ensure you refuse the OS or apps to access your location and turn off Cortana search. To those who went express and have Windows 10 already installed, just follow the easy how-to below. Step 1     Go to Settings > Privacy and individually go through the 13 tabs on the left. The “General” tab will have the most important settings to look at, while users should consider the calendar option, based on their intentions to use syncing of birthdays, scheduled appointments and so on.
 Step 2 Cortana isn’t readily available in Malaysia yet but those who listed United States as their current location will have the feature enabled. As mentioned earlier in the article, Cortana will be one of the huge culprits when it comes to capturing information about you, so users should think wisely whether they truly need this application. Step 3 
 The following step is the most important one that affects your browser(s). Funny thing though, it’s located on an  external (Windows) website  under settings. It won’t be hard to miss but no one would expect Windows to add a hidden toggle switch in a place away from your computer settings. Just set both options to “Off”. It is a must to create a Microsoft account/use an existing one when setting up Windows 10, and the fact that you’re constantly signed on when using the OS.  Step 4 
 The last step is quite extreme and it is only for those who are paranoid of anything going up to the cloud. You can opt to remove your Microsoft account entirely from Windows 10 and instead, use a local account. This action will limit features of the following: -synchronisation of settings across all PCs using the same account 
-authorisation from Windows Store and OneDrive To do so go to Settings > Accounts > select local account. For further reading on the subject head on over  here [  SOURCE ]"

An early impression that blew testers away, clearly destroying the norm of fingerprint scanners in its wake. The claims of being the first in the market could be somewhat lacklustre having being launched on the 25 th  of May, earlier this year – behind the likes of the  ViewSonic V55  and the  Vivo’s X5Pro . Boldly claiming that the Arrows NX F-04G will allow the screen to be unlocked in only 0.6 seconds, thus rendering passwords and on-screen gestures inefficient. Enabling the utilisation of this Iris Passport and Iris authentication technology is a front-facing 2.4 megapixel shutter and a rear 20.7 megapixel Sony Exmor sensor. A practically of sorts, the Iris Passport will be able to be used with other applications that require password authentication for payment or otherwise. Fujitsu however, sticks to the general trend of Japanese companies with a domestic-market only release. Locals won’t be disappointed with the device’s accompanying specs either – running a top of the line 64-bit Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 with graphics handled by the Adreno 430, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage that is expandable.

Huawei is up to something as well and a new Honor device has been spotted on China’s TENAA database with a rather interesting camera design. Both front and rear cameras are placed onto a sliding module which can be popped-up when required. A large physical button is spotted at the sides, which could be used to spring the camera into action.  The rear camera is always visible no matter what position its on but the front camera remains hidden until the slider is popped out. While it looks out of the norm, we simply don’t see any benefits of such approach considering the lens are still having a fixed position. At least on the OPPO N3, the rotating camera module is motorised, allowing you to take a hassle free panorama shots in either vertical or horizontal.  Perhaps the front of the smart phone looks cleaner this way but seriously nobody is complaining if there’s a selfie camera placed upfront. There’s no word on its full specs and if this aims to be a super camera phone, they should put more emphasis on its camera sensor, optics and its UI. Do you see any real benefits of a slider camera lens? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Although hastily reacting to this on this occasion, Google also promised to quickly resolve any future problems in their front-lining Nexus line. They’ll be doing this by releasing monthly security updates together with their usual platform updates. Users who currently own the following Nexus models can rest assured that a security patch will reach you soon: Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7, Nexus 9, Nexus 10 and the Nexus Player. Quoting Google on security updates, the security updates will continue to come for 3 years from the beginning of first availability or 18 months from the last time a device appears on the Google Store. Jumping aboard in the fight against software manipulation is Samsung. The Korean manufacturer has pledged to do the same with their own monthly security update to address vulnerabilities. Aimed at fast tracking patches as they are uncovered, Samsung plans to relay the updates with the same over-the-air method “regularly about once per month”.

Alexander Wong,Sony Xperia M5: A shrunken Xperia Z3+ with better cameras,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/08/03/sony-xperia-m5-officially-announced-21mp-13mp-cameras/,"Sony,sony xperia,Sony Xperia M5,Sony Xperia M5 Launch,Sony Xperia M5 Malaysia,Sony Xperia M5 Official","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Sony",2015-08-03,"The newly announced  Sony Xperia M5  is quite a weird device. It looks like an  Xperia Z3+ , carries high-end hardware underneath but Sony refuses to call it a flagship device. Instead, the Xperia M5 is dubbed as their “super mid-range” device and it carries one of the best mobile camera sensors Sony has to offer. On the exterior, it looks like a compact version of its Xperia Z3+ flagship especially the glossy bumpers on each corner. Like the newer waterproof Xperia models, it has IP68 rated resistance that allows you to submerge it under 1.5 metre deep of water for up to 30 minutes. And yes, the microUSB port is a capless design which makes charging hassle free. Like what  we’ve seen  in the earlier leaks, the Xperia M5 gets a 5″ Full HD 1080p display and it uses glass for both front and back. Underneath it runs on MediaTek’s 2.0GHz Helio X10 octa-core processor with 3GB RAM, which is a similar combo with HTC’s flagship, the One M9+. The Xperia M5 also comes with an expandable microSD slot which can support today’s highest  200GB capacity .  The main camera is Sony’s newer 21.5MP  IMX230  sensor with Hybrid Autofocus, which is better known as Phase Detection AF. With its quick 0.2 second focusing time, the Xperia M5 lets you take photos of fast moving objects with greater clarity. It shoot videos at 4K UHD resolution and it is further assisted with video stabilisation. The new sensor also lets you capture subjects clearly from afar with its 5X Clear Image Zoom.  For taking better selfies, the Xperia M5 gets a much larger 13MP camera in front which does auto focus. Keeping the lights on is a 2,600mAh capacity battery that’s rated to last up to 2 days and overall it weighs 143 grams with a thickness of 7.6mm. The Xperia M5 is available in White, Black and Gold colours, with availability starting from emerging markets in the middle of this month. If you’re looking for a compact flagship and find the 4.6″  Xperia Z3 Compact  too small, the Xperia M5 could be the compact flagship you’re looking for.

Is your data reaching its cap for no reason? Upgrading to  Windows 10  might be the problem. A thread on Reddit has brought us to the attention of Windows automatically using your PC to seed Windows updates to the world. Yes, the whole world. This issue will pose problems especially to those with home internet packages that are capped with a fixed high-speed download quota. So how do you disable or limit this seeding in particular? You have three options that you are free to choose from: disable seeding entirely, limit to computers in your local network (one internet connection source only, like your house) or leave it as it is. Luckily Windows allows this and users can follow this step by step tutorial below: 1. Go to Settings > Update & Security 
 2.  Windows Update > Advanced Options 3. From advanced options go to “Choose how updates are delivered” 
 4. From “Choose how updates are delivered” you can choose the following options: Turn off P2P transfer entirely or limit to transfer to PCs on your local network.

MiFi,Celcom Wireless Broadband,Merdeka Promo","Celcom,Players on the Field",2015-08-03,"If you need to connect up to 10 devices while on the go, Celcom has its own MiFi product that’s called the  PortaWiFi . As part of their Merdeka promo, they are offering its newer PortaWiFi 2.0 device on a new plan with more data and at a lower monthly commitment. This is seen as a response to U Mobile’s  latest broadband offer  that gives you 12GB of data (off-peak + on-peak) from RM68/month.  For RM85/month (Normal: RM100/month), the new PortaWiFi Internet Plan gives you a total of 21GB which is split with 7GB of quota for all day use, and a remaining 14GB for use between 2AM to 8AM. If you can’t finish your monthly quota, Celcom even allows you to carry forward unused data up to 7GB from your all day allocation.  There are 2 PortaWiFi versions available – 4G LTE and 3G, but we recommend you go for the 4G version since it is offered for free with a 12 months contract. During sign up, you’ll need to pay RM50 for registration and RM50 for activation fee. If you’re taking the 4G LTE PortaWiFi 2.0, there’s an advance payment of RM220 required which will be rebated back (RM22/month) across 10 months into your monthly bills. So that’s a total of RM320 to pay when you pick up your new PortaWiFi device. As comparison, the previous PortaWiFi  offers  4GB at RM68, 6GB at RM98 and 10GB and RM138. If you’re needing around 4GB to 7GB a month, the new offer is worth a look and the carry forward feature is a welcome bonus. In the previous PortaWiFi, the model itself requires a power source where you would need to plug it into a USB power adapter or through your car’s cigarette power outlet. The new one  appears to come  with its own battery, just like any other MiFis in the market. For more info, head over to Celcom’s  PortaWiFi 2.0  page."

The newest of the Sony line-up empathises innovations in the camera, design, and battery performance area of the device. Sony hopes to cement its place in the PROselfie category with the front and back 13-megapixel sensor and its near borderless 6-inch full HD display will aim to bring images that seem true to life. Offering the PROselfie feature akin to the C series, the Xperia C5 Ultra takes advantage of its twin 13-megapixel front and rear camera. Both shutters does auto focus and will include Sony’s signature Exmor RS sensor, HDR for stunning high-resolution pictures and video. Enhancing the PROselfie option is the Selfie Flash that is supported by the front camera: making sure there is enough light in the shot to showcase every inch of the photograph.  The lenses mentioned are also 22mm wide-angle lens, so it will be easier to cram more in each frame. The same images and video will be displayed on the huge 6-inch IPS display that is capable of Full HD and capitalises on Sony’s BRAVIA Engine 2, leaving the near borderless display fully ready to handle the most intrinsic detail in stills and videos. Coming in a variety of colours: black white and glossy soft mint, each has its own individual flare but all adorn an aluminium frame that allows the device to be sleek, stylish and ergonomic. Attesting to the “super mid-range” title, the Xperia C5 Ultra is no slouch in the processing area either, running a 1.7 GHz MediaTek Octa-core processor that is mated with 2 GB RAM and LTE enabled. The 2930 mAh battery is rated to last up to 7 hours and 47 minutes of video playback and users can further push their battery life with Ultra STAMINA mode. Memory hogs can take advantage of the expandable memory option, up to 200GB and the Sony device will be available in both single and dual SIM variants.   Expect to see the huge-screened Xperia C5 Ultra available in selected countries around the globe from mid-August onwards. We look forward to those PROselfie shots from everyone. [  SOURCE  ]"

The figures for this year stand at a downward 7% based on yearly figures, accounting for 44.7 million tablets worldwide. Possibly, hampered by the rise of other manufacturers that have successfully played catch-up. Front-runners, Apple and Samsung are seeing less of the overall market, from 45% of majority during the first quarter of the year, eventually dropping a combined 41% – due to the rise of LG, Huawei and Lenovo. So why are we seeing a dip? Well for one, it could be due to a gradual lack of innovations in the hardware department – the likes of the  iPad mini  2 to 3 comes to mind, as additions of the Touch ID being the only big difference and costing an incredible $100 more for only this feature. Not only specific to Apple, Microsoft’s Surface line has had its issues in its early beginnings but after the slow start, sales seemed to pick up and allow Windows to make a  44% increase  ($713 million in revenue) thanks to the  Surface Pro 3 . These earnings though, do not include the numbers from the Pro’s younger brother ( Surface 3 ), which could’ve given a boost to Microsoft. A case can be made for longer life cycles being a part of the tablet’s demise. Users are relying on their current generation tablets more, and foregoing the newer ones as they don’t bring much more to the table. That and considering the emergence of the phablet, which could seem more appealing to some to don’t quite have the budget for two devices. Needless to say, 2-in-1s and convertibles are also paving a way into the tablet’s market share. A lot of tough competition for a device that sits at a very narrow edge of a cliff. Will we see something worth buying soon? Only time will tell. [  SOURCE ,  SOURCE 2  ]"

Here’s a quick recap of the timeline of events that lead-up to OnePlus’ industry first grand VR launch as follows: 
 So following the VR launch, we only saw one device but at two different capacities, 16GB and 64GB. While this conflicts with earlier reports from Carl Pei, himself, this could just mean it wasn’t time yet for this particular OnePlus smartphone . Although, it’s confirmed that there is a OnePlus mini on the way, where the phone could be completely redesigned and more aesthetically focused as opposed to just being internally powerful. Mr Pei, went on to iterate that he was very close to choosing this upcoming device over the OnePlus 2 and it’ll be hard for users to decide between the two, so maybe those interested in picking up their new OnePlus toy should wait around Christmas to compare the two before making a purchase. During the interview, Pei also hit back at criticism behind omitting NFC from the OnePlus 2. He said that “Very few people are using NFC, so we cut it. It’s as simple as that”. He then went on to say most users keep their devices at a 12 to 18 month life-cycle, so by that time, there might be a reason to put it on OnePlus’ next phone. The current OnePlus 2, will likely come to Malaysian shores in the next couple of months. As SIRIM certification has been completed it won’t be too long before a partnership between distributor, Brightstar and Maxis lets us pick up the phone in stores. A short specs recap of the OnePlus 2 for those interested – the OnePlus 2 is equipped with a 5.5” Full HD display that is capable of a 1500:1 contrast aspect ratio, the infamous but revamped Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor mated to 4GB of RAM. The camera gets a bump too with a 13-megapixel shooter, which is accompanied by Optical Image Stabilisation technology and Laser Auto Focus, while the front dons a 5-megapixel sensor. Powering all this is a larger 3,300 mAh battery that will be charged using the newest USB Type C connector and the “2” will also support dual Nano-SIMs that are 4G LTE enabled. The 16GB version of the “2” retails at US$329 (approx RM 1,256), while the 64GB variant goes for US$389 (approx RM1,485). [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Carrying the serial number SM-N9208, the new device is listed with Dual-SIMs and it supports our 4G LTE bands as well as 802.11ac WiFi. From the looks of it, this could be Samsung’s first flagship device with dual-SIMs that’s going to be sold officially in Malaysia. 
 If you’re unconvinced, the Galaxy Note series usually carry the “SM-N9″ prefix for its model number. The Galaxy Note 3 for example is known as the SM-9005 while its cheaper Note 3 Neo carries the SM-N750 code. Meanwhile the Galaxy Note 4 for Malaysia (Exynos Version) carries the model number SM-910C while its Note edge version is also known as the SM-N915F. This isn’t the first time Samsung has made a DUOS version of its high-end device and there are a number of grey-import Galaxy S6 sold here with dual-SIM support.  A quick search on Google also reveals that the same model is a Galaxy Note 5 variant for the  Taiwanese  and  Chinese  market. A dual-SIM Galaxy Note 5 shouldn’t come as a surprise considering the newer flagships launched in Malaysia recently are dual-SIM ready, like the  Xperia Z3+ Dual  and the  HTC One E9+ . Even the upcoming  OnePlus 2  and the recently launched Mi Note in Malaysia comes with dual-SIM and 4G LTE support as well. Since dual-SIMs have become a standard offering for low to mid-spec smart phones, it does make sense for Samsung to offer dual-SIM flagships as its consumers graduates to a more upmarket model.

For those longing for a large phablet from Sony, the Xperia C5 Ultra features a huge 6″ display but it is slightly bigger than most 5.5″ smart phone thanks to its ultra-thin bezels.  Meanwhile the Xperia M5 looks like a budget and compact version of the  Xperia Z3+  but it features a newer  21MP Sony IMX230  camera sensor. This is the same 21MP shooter that’s found on the  Honor 7  and the recently announced  Moto X . If you’re looking to replace your 6.44″  Xperia Z Ultra , the Xperia C5 Ultra could be a worthy successor. The front gets a 6″ Full HD display which comes with an almost bezel-less display. The side frame is only 0.8mm thin, which gives an illusion of an edge to edge display. As speculated  earlier , it gets a similar underpinnings as the  Xperia C4  with a MediaTek MT6752 processor mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.  For imaging, it gets 13MP cameras for both front and back, and the front even comes with its own LED flash. This puts it head on with the  Desire EYE  which also comes with a similar dual-13MP combo set up. In terms of battery, it gets a 2,930mAh capacity unit (similar to the Xperia Z3+) which is quite small considering this is a large 6″ device.  Next is the Xperia M5 which comes as a surprise. It gets the same omni-balance design of its Xperia Z series and it even comes with a glossy plastic bumper on each corner, like the  Xperia Z3+ .  Under the hood, it gets some flagship credentials with a 2GHz MediaTek Helio x10 processor mated to 3GB of RAM and an expandable 16GB of storage. The screen is a 5″ Full HD IPS unit and keeping the lights on is a 2,600mAh capacity battery which is rated to last up to 2 days on a single charge.  The star of the show of course is the camera, which was teased being capable of  shooting split-second  images. This is none other than Sony’s newer IMX230 21MP camera that features Phase Detection Auto Focus. It boasts faster focus of 0.2 seconds, allowing you to capture fast moving objects with ease. For selfies, it gets a 13MP front shooter, similar to the Xperia C5 Ultra. The Xperia M5 is said to be 7.6mm thick and it is waterproof as well with IP65/68 rating even with its microUSB port exposed.

Like its predecessor, there’s a front facing flash for better lit selfies as confirmed by its  leaked manual . If Sony wants to make this a compelling photography focused smart phone, it might be fitted with a high end IMX230 21MP shooter that’s currently being used by the  Honor 7 .

Initially when the R7 series was  launched officially  in Malaysia, we are supposed to get its  R7 Lite  and  R7 Plus  siblings, priced at RM1,298 and RM1,998 respectively.  The folks at OPPO Malaysia has shared that due to market demands, they have decided to bring in the original R7 which claims to be quite popular in its home ground in China. If you’re looking for better specs without the phablet size, the R7 will be available starting tomorrow 12th August at RM1,598. But you’ve got to hurry since there’s only 2,000 units to go around for now.  The OPPO R7 slots in between in the R7 family and it features a 5″ Full HD AMOLED display with a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor and 3GB of RAM. It gets 16GB of storage that’s expandable with microSD, a 13MP main and a large 8MP front camera for higher resolution selfies. Keeping the lights on is a 2,320mAh capacity battery which supports VOOC Flash Charge and overall the R7 is only 6.3mm thick. Despite having an all metal build, the R7 is lighter than its ultra-slim  R5  at just 147 grams.  In terms of design, the OPPO R7 is identical to its R7 Lite and the only way to tell the difference is the display, since the Lite version pushes just HD 720p resolution. Another difference is the operating system where the OPPO R7 still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. This is surprising since its R7 Lite and R7 Plus are already running on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Nevertheless OPPO Malaysia promises that a Lollipop software update will be made available for the R7 soon. Like the rest of the family, the OPPO R7 series supports 4G LTE and Dual-SIMs, with the 2nd slot doing double duty as a microSD expansion if required.  For those that pre-ordered the R7 Plus, it will be available starting this Friday, 14th August. If you’re one of them, OPPO will be contacting you soon on collection details. For the R7 Lite, there’s no firm availability details yet but OPPO Malaysia is targeting by end of August."

It has been confirmed that the Gear A will utilise a crown-shaped power button and a bezel ring that rotates for on-screen navigation. The news surfaces from Samsung’s Tizen Developer Summit 2015 held in Bangalore, India. Surely the bezel ring addition will be more than welcomed as often times, watches’ small displays don’t play well with larger human extremities when using touch-screen navigation. Also, awhile back Samsung confirmed various specifications of the new smartwatch through a company software development kit (SDK) for developers. The first round-face device from the Korean powerhouse will cram an Exynos 3472 dual-core processor running at 1.2 GHz, 768 MB of RAM, 4GB of on board storage, and a 250 mAh battery underneath the glass display. Considering Samsung’s  scheduled  Galaxy Note 5 event on the 13 th  of August is not long off, all we can do is count down the days to see if Samsung can successfully compete with the Moto 360 and the LG Urbane.

The Jabra Sport Coach is a wireless headset that comes with intelligent audio coaching (hence the name) that will help you sort out your routine and workouts, with special focus on those interested in cross training. The headset will guide though any one of over 40 exercises from beginner to advanced with personalised in-ear coaching as you hit your workout with your favourite music. Like many members of Jabra’s family of sports oriented audio devices, it comes with three sets of eargels of different sizes for comfort and is shock and weatherproof up to IP55 standards. This means you could take a short run in the rain, but its not exactly built for a full blown swim.

The Sport Coach Wireless of course comes with Jabra’s own fitness app, Jabra Sports Life. It doesn’t have a heartbeat sensor though, but if you happen to need one you could find it in it’s sibling the  Jabra Sports Pulse . As for the audio, the headset is bolstered by Dolby Sound Enhancement to keep your music sounding sweet and clear, even while listening to tracks off YouTube. Combined with its wireless form which just hangs out behind your head and away from getting tangled up while you pump iron, you may very well just forget its there.

Your smart phone experience is only as good as the connection it’s on. No doubt most telcos these days offer 4G connectivity but did you know that not all networks are built the same? To enjoy seamless YouTube, gaming, web surfing and music streaming, you’ll need a network that’s both fast and consistent throughout the day.  If you want the best internet experience, Maxis should be on top of your list and read on for 4 reasons why. High speed 4G shouldn’t be limited to just the Klang Valley. Maxis covers 41% of the population with 4G and it continues to grow by the day. Apart from the major cities, you get to enjoy consistent and fast internet at more places including Langkawi, Alor Setar, Nilai, Muar, Sg. Petani, Batu Pahat, Labuan, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu, with more towns to come.  What’s the use of having high resolution smart phone screens if you had no choice but to stream low quality videos?  With Maxis 4G LTE, you’ll get 10X faster speeds which translate to buffer free YouTube playback. Based on research findings by Neilsen, you can expect zero YouTube HD buffering 96% of the time with Maxis. Don’t just take their word for it.

Following its  official announcement  a few days ago, the purported 2016 Flagship Killer has just passed our Malaysian SIRIM certification with the model number A2003, similar to  Singapore . Like the current OnePlus One, the new “2” will be distributed by Brightstar, and Maxis could be the exclusive telco as it was  teased  by them recently. Just to refresh your memory, the OnePlus 2 gets a similar 5.5″ Full HD display as its predecessor but it boast better viewing with a 1500:1 contrast aspect ratio. Powering the device is Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor that’s mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. In terms of storage, it comes in either 16GB or 64GB storage capacities which yet again is non-expandable with microSD.  For imaging it gets an improved 13MP f/2.0 camera that’s assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation and Laser Auto Focus, while the front gets a 5MP shooter. The battery of the OnePlus 2 is much larger now at 3,300mAh capacity but yet it still maintains a smaller footprint compared to the OnePlus One. Strangely the OnePlus 2 comes without NFC, which was included as standard in the previous model. The OnePlus 2 not only supports 4G LTE but it also offers dual-SIM support in Nano-SIM format. Among some of the new features include a fingerprint scanner which claims to be more advanced and quicker to unlock compared to TouchID on iPhones. Also new is a USB Type C data and charging port, which lets you plug in the cable in any direction. For greater control for notifications, there’s a physical alert slider which lets you switch to either, full notification, priority and off all notifications. At time of release, it runs on their proprietary OxygenOS that’s based on Android 5.1, but it offers more controls over your app permissions and notifications.   In terms of price, the 16GB model is going for US$329 (about RM1,256) while the 64GB version is priced at US$389 (about RM1,485). As comparison, the current OnePlus One with 64GB is offered at RM1,199 exclusively through Maxis. As usual, the first batch of OnePlus 2 will be offered through an invite system and the  reservation list  has exceeded more than 1.2 million in just 4 days.

With all the  leaks  we’ve seen lately, there’s probably very little surprises left to anticipate when the device is officially revealed.  Now serial leakster  @evleaks  has dropped a couple of new updates including a press render of the Galaxy Note 5 and the  S6 edge+  as shown above. This reaffirms the earlier  leaked photos  that have been circulating in the past few weeks. When it comes to its hardware specs, @evleaks alleged that the Galaxy Note 5 would be powered by the same  Exynos 7420 Octa-Core processor  (4x 2.1GHz + 4x 1.5GHz) that’s found on the Galaxy S6/S6 edge. For uncompromised multi-tasking experience, it will get 4GB of RAM and on-board storage starts from 32GB.  If you need more space, unfortunately there won’t be a microSD slot which is a common trend among the newer flagships. However it is likely that Samsung will be offering multiple storage variants but it really depends on each respective market. The screen is said to be a similar 5.7″ (5.66″ to be precise) Quad HD display and you can expect the same 16MP + 5MP camera combination as the Galaxy S6. For the S-Pen, it is worth pointing out that it is now placed on the left side instead of the usual right side. From some photos, the S-Pen is stowed flush into the metal frame and it could possibly feature a press to eject mechanism.  For the Galaxy S6 edge+, it won’t differ much from the current S6 edge except for a larger screen and a bigger battery capacity (rumoured to be 3,000mAh) to boot. Since it is going to be positioned higher than the current S6 edge, there’s a strong possibility that it will offer  4GB of RAM  as well. For those looking to replace their ageing Note II or Note 3, are you looking forward to the new Note 5 or the S6 edge+? In the mean time, you can feast your eyes on more photos of the alleged Galaxy Note 5 below.

Including the lauded features from the notably clean Windows 7 and the touch-screen friendly tiles of Windows 8, Windows 10 brings that and a whole lot more. The OS will be free for those who currently have a valid copy of Windows 7, 8 or 8.1. Microsoft has stepped up since receiving harsh criticism in 2012, as the newest version now has the simple but taken for granted “start” button – now including live tiles and a more extensive menu. This doesn’t just stop there, with innovations that include your own digital personal assistant, Cortana, Hello – a biometric authentication program, an Xbox app, plus their new browser, Microsoft Edge. Users can expect this to be the greatest version of Windows yet, having been in beta testing the longest. This is to ensure delivery of a service tried and trusted and will be kept automatically up-to-date with tweaks and security updates throughout its lifetime. Utilising cross-platform connectivity which is a necessity in today’s world, the latest version will become available on a broad range of devices that range from PCs, tablets, phones, Raspberry Pi, Xbox One, and HoloLens to name a few. Microsoft envisions a new era that is built around feedback from 5 million fans world-wide, quoting Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Windows and Devices Group, at Microsoft. Cortana will be the main headliner for the Windows Store, that’ll be accessible across all devices running Windows 10. This essentially allows the search feature to be voice-enabled for ease of use. Pricing for those who aren’t directly upgrading hasn’t been announced yet but a rough estimate can be made from the US pricing. Windows 10 will cost an estimated RM 456 for the Home version, after the exchange rate. On the other hand, upgrading will totally free and will be rolled-out in waves, depending on the hardware of your machine; BUT if you want to bypass that, check out how to get Windows 10 immediately right  here ."

Street View has been a part of Google’s features since the mid-2007, giving a more hands on experience of virtual navigation. Capitalising on capturing the public roads in East Malaysia, to further enhance the imagery of the motorways for locals, the feature is now live. The beginning of the roll-out will publish roughly 80 percent of stills found in Sabah and Sarawak’s public roads, including – important highways, roads with tolls, state roads and urban centres that took 6 months. Notably the images that Google captured involved some off-road excursions that was captured with their Street View Trekker, a harnessed backpack-mounted camera system. East Malaysia is no slouch in this category either, with special panoramic images of a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its limestone karst formations;  Mulu National Park . Google took advantage of the wearable backpack camera system and managed to add Mulu National Park to the list of others: Taman Negara, Pangkor and Langkawi. Giving glimpses of these beautiful locations might just give tourist and locals the push they need to visit the sites. Managing Director of Google Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines – Sajith Sivanandan, announced that the Street View Imagery Launch allows Malaysians to have a more experience-filled time that takes usability, comprehensiveness and enjoyment to a new level. To find the Street View feature, users will notice the familiar orange “Pegman” that’s located on the bottom right-hand side of the map and drag the icon onto any blue highlighted street. Google has always been prompt to address any issues regarding privacy and Street View Imagery’s highly sophisticated technology makes faces and license plates blurred to keep identities anonymous. To add, Google also has a system that allows users to request additional blurring of images that feature them or something of importance. Request for the following can be made easily with the “report a problem” tool that is readily available on the bottom right corner of Google Maps.

This is due to size constraints of its camera sensor that’s harder to fit on ultra-thin designs. With Samsung being a major player in the semiconductor business, they have just announced the industry’s first 1.0 micron pixel based 16MP CMOS Image Sensor for mobile devices.  The Samsung S5K3P3 image sensor utilises their own  ISOCELL technology  that was first featured on the Galaxy S5. This helps reduce crosstalk between nearby pixels and it helps to increase light sensitivity as well.  As a result, the new 16MP sensor is tinier than other 16MP image sensors in the market with up to 20% reduction in height. This allows smart phone designers to create a ultra-thin device with less protruding lenses without compromising on image quality. Samsung reckons that it will produce images that are on par with other 1.2 micron based image sensors in the market. As comparison, the IMX240 sensor that’s being used on the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S6, is still based on 1.2 micron pixel size. Meanwhile the popular IMX214 13MP Sony Sensor that’s used by majority of flagship smart phones is has a pixel size of 1.12 micron.  Looking at the timing of the announcement, this compact 16MP Samsung image sensor could find its way onto the upcoming  Galaxy Note 5  that’s launching on 13th August. However from the earlier  leaked images  that we saw, the Galaxy Note 5 still has a camera bump but it doesn’t seem to protrude as much as the current Galaxy S6/S6 edge. Camera bumps or not, what really matters is if it takes good shots with minimal fuss. As  chosen by our readers , the 16MP Sony IMX240 is a stellar performer and that’s the benchmark to beat for this new in-house developed sensor. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

In the previous  Moto X for 2014 , it was quite an average flagship device with a 5.2″ Full HD display and a Snapdragon 801 processor that’s powered by a rather small 2,300mAh capacity battery. For 2015, Motorola is trying to cover all segments above the  Moto G  with a mid-range 5.5″ Moto X Play and a higher-spec 5.7″ Moto X Style. What are the differences between the two? Read on to find out.  
Among the two, the Moto X Style (or  Moto X Pure Edition  in the US) is their top of the line offering with a huge 5.7″ Quad HD (2560×1440) display and it runs on a Hexa-Core Snapdragon 808 processor that’s currently powering the  LG G4 . It is mated to 3GB of RAM and comes with a choice of 32GB or 64GB of storage. Unlike the previous 2nd gen model, the new Moto X gets a microSD slot which accepts up to 128GB capacity. For better audio playback, it also gets a pair of front firing stereo speakers.  For imaging, it gets a high-resolution 21MP f/2.0 main camera that shoots 4K videos while the front sports a 5MP f/2.0 shooter that has its own flash light. In terms of connectivity, it gets Bluetooth 4.1 LE, WiFi 802.11ac MIMO support, NFC and 4G LTE Cat 6 with speeds up to 300Mbps. It isn’t submergeable but the Moto X Style gets a nano coating repellent that’s IP52 certified. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports Turbo Charging. 
Moving down a notch, is the Moto X Play which offers a 5.5″ Full HD (1920×1080) display and a mid-range Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to just 2GB of RAM. For storage, it gets a smaller 16GB or 32GB options with room for more via its microSD expansion slot. The main camera is also a 21MP shooter with dual-tone LED flash but the front gets a more basic 5MP camera.  Connectivity is also a step back with Bluetooth 4.0 LE, WiFi up to 802.11n but it still supports 4G LTE which probably is only up to Cat4 (150Mbps). Despite being positioned lower, it gets a larger 3,630mAh battery which is rated to last 30 hours with mixed use. As you would expect, both Moto Xs are running on the latest Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. In terms of  pricing , the top notch Moto X Play is going for 299 Pounds (about RM1,776) while the Moto X Style is priced from 359 Pounds (about RM2,132) in the UK. For the US, the Moto X Style that’s called the  Pure Edition  is priced from US$399.99 (about RM1,522) for the 16GB version. No word of its availability in Malaysia but hopefully the folks at Brightstar would give them a more reasonable price tag.  For more info, check out the respective Moto X  Play  and  Style  pages.

Google Play Movies has finally landed in Malaysia, offering users the option to rent or purchase movie content.  In terms of cost, renting a movie starts at RM10 for Standard Definition and we noticed it can go up to RM17 for HD. Once you’ve started playing your rented movies, it will expire after 48 hours but take note that it will sit on your library unplayed for up to 30 days. If you prefer keeping your movies, it will cost anything from RM29 for SD and up to RM67 for HD. Of course the price varies depending on content but do expect an average of RM10-13 for a standard rental and an average of RM50 to purchase.  The selection of movies is not too bad as you get new releases including Kingsman, Taken 3, Chappie and Interstellar. Browsing through the list, you can expect more titles in future as they source movie titles from Warner Bros, 20th Century Fox, Disney, Sony, Paramount and Universal. In terms of payment, it is done through your linked credit or debit card on your Google Play Store account, so it is similar to buying apps.  For iPhone and iPad users, you are able to enjoy the movies as well by downloading the Google Play Movies app from the  appstore . What’s interesting to point out is that the HD content can be viewed on Chromecast, Chrome browser, Roku and of course Android devices with a HD screen. Now probably is a good time to consider a  Chromecast  for your home HD TV.  Hopefully Google would roll out TV Shows in our market next.

Cheryl Bates,Sony Xperia Z3+ First Impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/29/sony-xperia-z3-first-impressions-2/,"Sony,Sony Xperia Z3,Sony Xperia Z3 Plus,sony xperia z3 plus hands on,sony xperia z3 plus launch malaysia,Sony Xperia Z3 Plus Malaysia","Mobile Devices,Sony",2015-07-29,"Despite the phone seeing its entry into the Malaysian market a good month or so ago, we finally get to try out the  Sony Xperia Z3+  in the flesh. The phone is essentially an updated version of the waterproof  Sony Xperia Z3  that’s skinnier, lighter than it’s counterpart and has a bare microUSB port. On the surface the Xperia Z3+ shares a lot in common with its sibling, sharing a very similar styling complete with fingerprint magnet glossy finish. It is a fair bit lighter and thinner than its counterpart, being 6.9mm thin as opposed to the 7.3mm thickness of the Xperia Z3.  Its also just 8 grams lighter than its sibling but since both phones are already very light you don’t entirely feel the difference. However the battery has also been given the skinny treatment and has a slightly smaller capacity at 2,930mAh as opposed to the former’s 3,100mAh, but Sony claims that it will last for two entire days thanks to software tweaks. We won’t know for certain how long the battery will really last till we get to do some real world tests on the unit. To recap the specs, the dual-SIM smartphone has a octa-core Snapdragon 810 under the hood that’s mated to 3GB RAM. It has the same 5.2 inch Full HD display as its sibling, alongside dual front stereo speakers and built in Hi-Res audio capabilities. As far as storage is concerned you get 32GB out of the box, but this can be bumped up to 128GB via the microSD slot. It will also similarly support PlayStation remote play with your PlayStation 4. The cameras on the other hand are mostly as what’s on the Xperia Z3, namely a 20.7 megapixel snapper with a 5 megapixel front shooter for the selfie centric. So no changes here save for the front camera getting an upgrade from 2 megapixel. It will also run Android Lollipop out of the box skinned with Sony’s latest UI. As far as looks are concerned, both phones have the same glass and metal design with the exception of the Xperia Z3+ having added plastic “bumpers” on the edges of the smartphone, possibly to prevent damage and dings that were common on the prior model. They still feature that glossy fingerprint magnet rear cover as well. For now Malaysia will only have the Black and Copper versions available, with the White and Aqua Green options to become available at a later date. Personally we’ve mostly liked Sony’s style direction but its about time they went for something other than the glossy glass backing for their premium smartphones. The ports have been given some updates as well, with the biggest change being that the USB slot has been moved to the bottom of the device and is now capless to make charging a lot simpler. The SIM slot has been moved to the other side of the device but still remains capped, but since it is not something you will be regularly opening up it shouldn’t be an issue. Overall, Sony’s update to their flagship Xperia Z3 is looking decent and if you happen to need a high end smartphone that you could take into the shower, this might be your ticket.  The device will retail for RM 2,599 and is already available in the market, which is RM 400 more than the Xperia Z3 which is currently priced at RM 2,199. So would you still go for the Sony Xperia Z3 or its more powerful sibling?"

Powering the device is a newer MediaTek MT6735 Quad-Core processor but it is clocked lower at 1.3GHz. As comparison, the previous m1 runs on a MediaTek MT6732 procesor with 4 cores running at 1.5GHz.  The biggest change is the amount of RAM and storage it brings, with 2GB of LPDDR3-RAM and 16GB of high performance eMMC 5.0 storage. If you need to store more photos and videos, it accepts microSD cards up to 128GB. Take note that the microSD slot is shared with the 2nd SIM tray slot of this dual-SIM 4G LTE device. The choice of cameras remain unchanged with a 13MP f/2.2 main camera while the front gets 5MP f/2.0 unit. Keeping the lights on is a similar capacity 2,500mAh non-removable battery and out of the box it runs on the latest FlymeOS 4.5 that’s based on Android 5.1. Overall the m2 it is thinner at 8.7mm (m1: 8.9mm) but it is slightly heavier at 131g (m1: 128g). With its improved specs, the m2 is priced at only 599 CNY (about RM367), which is cheaper than the m1 that  was originally listed  at 699 CNY (about RM428).  So far there’s still no word of its availability outside of China. No matter how quirky its FlymeOS feels, having 2GB RAM, 16GB storage and dual-SIMs with 4G LTE for under RM400 is a bargain you can’t ignore."
Alexander Wong,HTC One E9+ has landed in Malaysia. Its larger flagship with a lower price tag,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/30/htc-one-e9-plus-officially-arrive-in-malaysia/,"HTC,HTC One e9,HTC One E9 Malaysia,HTC One E9 Plus,HTC One E9 Plus Malaysia,HTC One E9 Plus Price","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-07-30,"HTC Malaysia has officially announced the  One E9+  in Malaysia, which is the affordable alternative to its current  One M9+  flagship. Priced at RM1,899, it is RM700 cheaper than its metal clad flagship and it even gets a larger 5.5″ display that does a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440. The noticable difference of course is the build where the One E9+ has a matte plastic back but it still gets a metal frame around the device for a more upmarket feel.  
Under the hood, the HTC One E9+ runs on the same MediaTek’s Helio x10 MT6795M Octa-Core 64-bit processor and it is mated to 3GB of RAM and has 32GB of on-board storage. Like the HTC One M9+, you do get a microSD card expansion up to 2TB.  For imaging, it gets a 20MP main camera with a single LED flash. As comparison, the One M9+ has a dual camera set up and comes with a dual-tone LED flash light. Over the front, it has a 4MP Ultrapixel camera and also retained is HTC’s signature Boom Sound stereo speakers. Another omission is a fingerprint sensor at the front, which gives the bottom speaker grill a cleaner look.  Despite going bigger in size, the One E9+ gets a 2,800mAh non-removable battery which is slightly smaller than the 5.2″ One M9+ that came with a 2,840mAh capacity unit. Overall it weighs 149g and has a thickness of 7.54mm, which is considerably thinner and lighter than the One M9+. For the Malaysian market, the One E9+ supports 4G LTE and it comes with dual-SIM slots in Nano-SIM sizes. If you don’t need a fingerprint scanner or a secondary Duo camera, the One E9+ is worth the RM700 savings. It is available now at authorised dealers and it comes in either Gold Sepia and Classic Rose Gold."
Alexander Wong,Samsung releases its ultra-thin Galaxy A8 phablet in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/30/samsung-galaxy-a8-malaysia-official-launch/,"Android,Dual Sim,galaxy a8,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A,samsung galaxy a8,samsung galaxy A8 malaysia,Samsung Galaxy A8 Malaysia Spec,Samsung Galaxy A8 Official,Smart Phone dual SIM","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-07-30,"The  Samsung Galaxy A  series aims to deliver an affordable premium experience for the masses. Now they have just introduced its latest member, the  Galaxy A8 . At 5.7 inches, it has the same screen size as the Galaxy Note series and it is also Samsung’s thinnest smart phone at only 5.9mm. The Galaxy A8 is officially launched in Malaysia at RM1,888 and we’re getting the 32GB storage option along with dual-SIMs supporting 4G LTE. The front Super AMOLED display pushes a Full HD 1920×1080 resolution which is pretty decent and powering this slender device is a Samsung Exynos 5430 Octa-Core processor (4x 1.8GHz + 4x 1.3GHz) that’s mated with 2GB of RAM. While it is a dual-SIM device, the secondary slot is a hybrid one where it allows you to insert a microSD card for memory expansion. For taking pictures, it gets a 16MP f/1.9 camera that’s similar to the Galaxy S6 but without Optical Image Stabilisation and selfie shots are handled by its 5MP front unit. Another welcome addition is its larger 3,050mAh capacity battery which is a step up from the former 2,600mAh capacity unit on the  Galaxy A7 . The overall design is a nice progression from its former Galaxy A series as it adopts some elements from its current Galaxy S6 flagship and carries the same processor as the Galaxy Alpha. The metal frame feels more refined with some chiseled edges, while the home button gets a fingerprint sensor which allows you to launch the camera instantly when you double tap. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop with its custom TouchWiz interface on top, which you can customise with its variety of themes available. The Galaxy A8 is available now and it comes in 3 colours – Gold, White and Black."
Alexander Wong,Moto G 2015: Motorola’s popular mid-ranger gets upgraded and it comes with water resistance,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/28/moto-g-2015-motorolas-popular-mid-ranger-gets-upgraded-and-it-comes-with-water-resistance/,"3rd gen Moto G,Android,Moto,Moto G,moto g 2015,Motorola,Motorola Moto G,motorola moto G 2015,smart phone,Water Resistant","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Motorola",2015-07-28,"Before  Xiaomi  and Huawei’s  Honor  sub-brand came into the picture, the  Motorola Moto G  was the original cheap and cheerful Android smart phone. Running on a stock operating system, it gets early access to the latest software updates and it feels very smooth to use despite having low to mid-range hardware.  With the rise of affordable and decent smart phones in the market, can the Moto G step up its game to maintain its relevance? We could probably say yes thanks to some minor tweaks that make quite a difference. The Moto G in its 3rd iteration now gets a subtle tweak especially at the back where it gets a redesigned camera and Motorola logo placement. The front is still a compact 5″ display that’s perfect for single handed use and the screen resolution remains unchanged at 1280×720 resolution.  To withstand the elements, the front glass is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3 and this time, the Moto G comes with IPX7 water resistant. This protects the device from accidental splashes or drops into the pool as it can withstand being submerged up to 1 metre of fresh water for up to 30 minutes.  Under the hood, it gets an updated mid-range Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor but it runs on a higher 1.4GHz. As comparison, the Redmi 2 and Galaxy A5 are powered by a similar processor but on a lower 1.2GHz clock speed. Usually the Moto G settles for a measly 1GB of RAM with 8GB of storage but now it gets an additional high-spec option of 2GB RAM with 16GB of storage. If that’s not enough, there’s also a microSD slot that accepts up to 32GB of extra storage. The Moto G has always been mediocre when it comes to photography but this time it receives an upgraded 13MP f/2.0 shooter that supports Auto HDR, Slow Mo and it records full HD videos. For better lighting it is assisted by dual-tone LED flash and you can even launch the camera app instantly by just simply twisting your wrist. Knowing that people love taking selfies, the front camera gets a more up to date 5MP f/2.2 shooter with a wide 72 degree field of view.  Powering the device is a larger 2,470mAh capacity battery which they say is enough to pull through 24 hours of use in a single charge. It supports 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, WiFi 802.11n and if you’re wondering, it still doesn’t support NFC. At time of release, it runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and it will definitely receives Android M once it is available. The Moto G is available in both Black and White colours but you can personalise your device with a colourful variety of Motorola Shells. For more info, you can visit the  Moto G 2015  page."

Pretty bold claims from the Chinese outfit, seeing that it is only the beginning of Q3 for 2015. Updates on the AnTuTu benchmarks proves some promising news on purported 3 variants of the OnePlus 2. Having earlier showing up on the same benchmarks with 2 other scores: 51,460 and chart-topping 63,700 for the heating-riddled Snapdragon 810. The latest scores however port at 49,221, which leads to speculation that there are more than 1 model to be released tomorrow. Part 1 Part 2 The same AnTuTu scores exhibit different specifications, when looking at the resolution of the screen(s) – further fuelling us to believe that OnePlus may indeed launch a lower-spec model that is supposed to have a 1080 x 1920 resolution screen.  TENAA’s certification , on the other hand, states that the same 5.5-inch screen will push a higher 1440 x 2560 resolution. So far, it isn’t quite far-fetched to conclude the validity of the leaks as yet another benchmark test, the GFX Bench affirmed the amount of RAM (4GB) that was announced by co-founder Carl Pei, himself. This is amid other reports have been going around – in reference to 3 different listings by Bluetooth Special Interest Group that confirms the models: A2001, A2003 and A2005. All 3 were certified with a hardware version 2.2 and software version 2.01 for the newest Bluetooth 4.1 technology. There seems to be an overlap and inconsistency in terms of these leaks but with only tomorrow’s morning away, we might as well wait it out and see if there’s any potential in the OnePlus 2 being the “2016 Flagship Killer” Although, if you want to wait in anticipation tune into the play by play of the announcement, feel free to download the VR Launch app  here , provided you have a VR Cardboard. If you don’t, OnePlus has provided a  how-to DIY  for your need-to watch needs. [  SOURCE ,  SOURCE 2 ]"

Previously when 3GB seemed a lot, Samsung just might be considering to add the  S6 edge+  to the ever-growing list. The rumoured S6 edge+ has picked up a lot of pace recently, as August is around the corner. There is a strong possibility the 4GB slot in Samsung’s line-up will be two-fold come August the 12 th  (rumoured release date), as the Note 5 is also said to have the same RAM internals. No surprise here, as currently in the market, other players have already equip their phones with the same 4GB of RAM – Asus Zenfone 2, Lenovo K80, and Xiaomi Mi Note Pro. Supposedly, the same rumour also mentions the mobile devices’ battery (3000 mAh), along with Samsung’s signature Exynos 7420 processor. With bumps in the current RAM (3GB) and battery (2600 mAh) compared to its little sibling, the S6 edge, the likeliness of it costing more would be a safe assumption. Just to give a rough idea of how much it’ll cost, here’s the pricing breakdown of the S6 edge and similarly sized iPhone 6 Plus locally: With prices that look like that, more RAM & battery could mean a significant hit to its price-point.

Some are speculating that the new version will feature a stylus auto-eject feature which not only makes it cleaner to stow but feels more tactile to take out when you need it. Based on the latest images from  @onleaks , taking out the S-Pen stylus is no different from the current Note 4 or its predecessors. While it looks more flush with its metal frame, there’s an exposed portion at the side which gives enough room for you to pry it out with your fingernails. Do note that these are just alleged prototypes and the final product might be different from what is shown here.  With the latest flagships like the S6 and S6 edge sporting premium materials, the S-Pen might get a redesign with matching metallic colours. A Gold Platinum colour S-Pen is shown below and the top has a metallic end while the mid-section maintains a secondary button.   The S-Pen on the Galaxy Note 4 marks a huge improvement over its previous stylus with 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity and it gets heaps of productivity features out of the box. What will Samsung do next to improve its S-Pen? We’ll find out in a couple of weeks time as the Note 5 and S6 edge+ are expected to be announced as early as 12th August.

If you’re clueless on how the Note 5 looks like, now we have a clearer view thanks to  fresh leaks  taken at multiple angles. This appears to be a sample set to demonstrate Nillkin’s new clear case for the upcoming  productivity phablet.  Matching the  earlier renders , the Galaxy Note 5 will have a curve glass back which slopes towards the edges, similar to Xiaomi’s  Mi Note . Like the S6 and S6 edge, the Galaxy Note 5 will come with striking metallic colours which reflects light to give a shimmering effect. The design language is the same as well with the use of a metallic frame and it looks like a reverse version of the S6 edge with the slopping lines aligned towards the back. It also gets a protruding camera lens with its LED flash and heart rate sensor placed right next to it. The top looks clean and surprisingly they omitted the infrared blaster and all you get is a nano SIM tray slot and a secondary mic. Looking at the bottom end, you’ll find a headphone jack, microUSB port, a speaker grill and mic as well as an S-Pen silo. Both sides appears to be clean with just the typical volume rockers and power button visible. Unless Samsung is doubling up its SIM tray slot for a microSD card option, it looks like there isn’t any expandable storage and removable battery for the Galaxy Note 5. Like the S6, storage should come with a minimum of 32GB with larger options being offered at selected markets. In terms of specs, it is expected to retain its 5.7″ Quad HD display and underneath it runs on a newer Exynos 7422 that’s mated with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. With the launch happening on 13th August, Samsung could be selling this new phablet before the end of August.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Samsung has officially announced its next Unpacked event which is going to be held just slightly more than 2 weeks from now. The Galaxy Note series which has been traditionally announced during  IFA  in Berlin is currently held a month earlier in a bid to maximise its sales potential ahead of Apple’s upcoming announcement.  The launch will be streamed live as usual on their Samsung Mobile  YouTube channel  and it is happening at 11:00AM EDT which is at 11:00PM Malaysian Time.  Samsung is expected to announce 2 phablets – the  Galaxy Note 5  and the  Galaxy S6 edge+ , both of which  are certified  by Singapore’s certification body recently. Following the  Galaxy S6 , the new models will feature a similar metal and glass body construction and we’ve seen several  leaked photos  confirming this approach. In terms of specs, the new Note 5 is expected to run on its newer all-in-one Exynos chip which is mated with 4GB of RAM. Instead of a Note “Edge” variant, the second device would be the S6 edge+, which is a larger and enhanced version of its current Galaxy S6 edge. While it looks the same on the outside, word has it that it will carry 4GB of RAM, a likely updated processor as well as a bigger battery capacity to power up its larger screen. Unfortunately for power users, we expect the new models to come without a removable battery and expandable microSD slot like its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge models.  If Samsung wants to outdo Apple in sales, they should be selling this fairly quickly and word has it that it could go to market as early as 21st August. We’ll find out for sure in a couple of weeks time. Wondering what to expect with the next Galaxy Note 5? You can check our  previous posts . [  SOURCE  ]"
Alexander Wong,OnePlus 2 is now official. Coming to South East Asia in Q4,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/28/oneplus-2-is-now-official-coming-to-south-east-asia-in-q4/,"Android,OnePlus,oneplus 2,OnePlus 2 Launch,OnePlus 2 Malaysia,oneplus two,OnePlus Two malaysia,OxygenOS,USB Type C","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,OnePlus",2015-07-28,"After several weeks of teasing, the  OnePlus 2  is officially announced in what seems to be the world’s first VR launch. Dubbed as the 2016 flagship killer, it carries a lot of expectations and most fans are hoping they could keep the price as low as its  OnePlus One  predecessor.  OnePlus aims to give the best specs they could possibly offer while maintaining an optimal user experience. They have also thrown in a couple of new features which are among the first to be fitted on an Android smart phone.  For starters, the front of the OnePlus 2 is a similar 5.5″ screen size that pushes the same full HD 1080p resolution as the One. However it has been much improved with a brighter in-cell IPS display that’s viewable under harsh sunlight and it boast a higher 1500:1 contrast ratio. This offers better blacks and bolder colours. The OnePlus 2 has an aluminium alloy frame and the back comes with its signature sandstone black colour. For a touch of personalisation, there will be StyleSwap covers which are sold separately as well. Under the hood, it gets the latest Qualcomm Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor with a top of the line 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. Like the previous model, you get the option of either 16GB or 64GB storage options which isn’t expandable with microSD. The OnePlus 2 this time around supports dual-SIMs (nano) with 4G LTE. For imaging it gets a 13MP f/2.0 camera with 1.3 micron size pixels and it is assisted by laser focus and Optical Image Stabilisation. In the camera app, it allows you to take super resolution photos up to 50MP and slow motion videos up to 120fps. The front however gets a 5MP camera for selfies.  Powering the device is a 3,300mAh capacity battery which is now charged with a reversible USB Type C, the latest standard for mobile devices. If you want to use your existing chargers, you can do so with an add-on accessory. Another new addition is a fingerprint scanner at the front which registers up to 5 fingers and it claims to respond quicker than iPhone’s Touch ID.  On top of that, you also get better controls over your notifications with its Alert Slider. This is similar to the silent switch on the iPhone but you get 3 settings (e.g. full notification, priority, off).  Out of the box, the OnePlus 2 runs on its own OxygenOS that’s still based on Android Lollipop. However it offers a couple of Android M features including permission and notification management on the app level.  In terms of availability, it will hit the US, Canada, India, Europe and China markets on 11th August. For the rest of us in South East Asia, we would need to wait until Q4 which is a few months from now. OnePlus will still be using the invitation system but they would allocate more units this time around with priority given to its loyal forum members.  The OnePlus 2 is priced at US$329 for the 16GB model and US$389 for the 64GB version, which is roughly RM1,256 and RM1,485 respectively in our current exchange rate. As comparison, the current OnePlus One 64GB is going for RM1,199 which is currently sold exclusively via Maxis. For the OnePlus 2, Maxis could still be the exclusive telco but we’ll have to wait and see in the next few months to come.

Alexander Wong,MaxisGO offers 2GB data with bundled phone calls and SMS at RM48/month but there’s a catch,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/28/maxisgo-offers-2gb-data-with-bundled-phone-calls-and-sms-at-rm48month-but-theres-a-catch/,"Maxis Go Postpaid,Maxis postpaid,MaxisGo,Postpaid,RM48 Postpaid","Maxis,Players on the Field",2015-07-28,"The mobile postpaid scene in Malaysia was shaken recently with affordable data plans from  Digi ,  Celcom  and  U Mobile . In response to these affordable sub-RM40 plans, Maxis is now introducing its MaxisGO postpaid with 2GB of data at RM48/month. That’s not all as it also includes 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS each month. So is this better than its  SurfMore 50  plan with 2GB/month? Wait until you read the fine lines. For starters, the 2GB data quota is split into 2 buckets – 1GB which you can use for the whole day and another 1GB that’s restricted for off peak use between 2am – 7am. Strangely while you can sign up for the plan now, the off peak data  is only available effective 30 July 2015. For the bundled 100 minutes calls and 100 SMS each month, it is applicable for all networks in Malaysia. Another difference is the top up cost of data should you need more than just 1GB (all day). An extra 500MB costs RM38 and 1GB costs RM48, which is the price of the full subscription fee itself. As comparison, Maxis charges just  RM15 per GB  on its SurfMore plans. So if data is more important to you, you’re better off with their current SurfMore 50 plan.  In summary, this is for the light data users who need more calls and SMS than the average data-centric user. If you’re on SurfMore 50 plan, this makes sense if you make quite a significant number of calls and you hardly use 1GB of data each month.

The telco also is the sole retail channel for the  OnePlus One  in Malaysia and this doesn’t surprise us one bit. To recap on the specs of the OnePlus 2, it has a similar 5.5 inch screen with Full HD 1080p resolution as the OnePlus One with an improved IPS display with better contrast and colours. Under the hood is the latest Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor mated to a top of the line 4GB LD-DDR4 RAM, which should make it quite a monster in the performance department. In terms of storage you get to choose between 16GB or 64GB flavours, but neither versions are expandable via microSD.  It will also have nano dual-SIM support with 4G LTE for zippy surfing. As for the camera, you will get a 13 megapixel f/2.0 rear snapper with laser focus and Optical Image Stabilisation as well as a 5 megapixel selfie cam up front. Last but not least, the device will have a 3,300mAh battery keeping everything juiced by way of a reversible USB Type C port. The OnePlus 2 is priced at US$329 for the 16GB model and US$389 for the 64GB version, which is roughly RM1,256 and RM1,485 respectively in our current exchange rate. It’s very likely Maxis will have a plan to go with the phone, but the big question is how soon will we be getting it?"

Ahead of its official reveal, a 2 minute promo video has surfaced which confirms several things we’ve heard of so far. Like the alleged specs, it will get a 5″ HD 720p display, a new Quad-Core processor, dual-SIM with 4G LTE as well as a 13MP main and 5MP front camera. A new improvement is its water resistance of  IPX7 , which allows you to submerge it under 1 metre of water for up to 30 minutes.  Being a 3rd gen device, Motorola has given it a fresher looking back which comes with a rugged rubbery appearance. The main camera and dual-LED flash piece gets a newer design as if there’s a volume rocker mounted at the back.

The Galaxy Note series which is often launched during IFA in Berlin annually, will be seeing an earlier launch this year as early as 12th/13th August.  Unlike last year where they have launched the  Galaxy Note 4  along with its curve display  Galaxy Note edge , Samsung will be introducing its  Galaxy Note 5  productivity phablet that comes with an S-Pen and the  Galaxy S6 edge+ , which is a  bigger version  of its current double curve screen smart phone. The model names  have been confirmed  and now we finally get to see the devices in its full glory thanks to a couple of fresh leaks. As expected, the Galaxy Note 5 continues Samsung’s new premium approach with the use of metal and glass like its current S6 flagship. Directly from the front, it looks like a Note 4 but the bezels are noticeably thinner and it looks like it carries a similar 5.7″ screen that’s going to be pushing Quad HD resolution. A metal frame is visible and you can see some antenna bands in white at the top and bottom of the device. The home button looks identical with the s6 which undoubtedly come with a one touch fingerprint sensor. So far there’s no pictures of the back but we reckon it will feature a glass with shimmering metal appearance underneath. In terms of specs, the Note 5 will feature its top of the line offering and this time the processor could be a new all-in-one chip solution that houses the CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU and radio antennas. Their current Exynos 7420 chip on the S6/S6 edge is enjoying its  top spot on Antutu  benchmarks and the new one is expected to raise the bar higher. Like most new flagship smart phones launched lately, the Note 5 is likely to come with 4GB RAM.   The S6 edge+ is not much of a surprise really as it retains the exact same design as the current S6 edge but it is slightly wider and taller. Underneath, it will get the same specs and if you missed it, you can check out some  side by side  comparison shots of both models. On the hardware side, it is the same as the S6 edge but you can probably expect a larger battery capacity to power up a larger screen for longer hours.  Both models could go on sale as early as end of August and Samsung is expecting its early release would give them a better chance to sell more devices ahead of Apple’s new iPhone that’s going to be announced in a few months time. In the last 3 months of 2014, Apple has  sold more iPhones  than Samsung and that’s when the Galaxy Note 4 has hit the ground running. Looks like Apple has made the right choice of introducing the  iPhone 6 Plus  and Samsung would need to do much more to secure its spot in the premium phablet segment.  Samsung Galaxy Note 5

Like other flagship smart phones, it carries a RM2,599 price tag and for the Malaysian market, we are getting the Dual-SIM version. The Xperia Z3+ looks similar to the previous model from the exterior but it gets some notable differences, including a capless micro USB port which makes charging hassle free. Powering the device is a Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. The display is the same 5.2″ Full HD display and it also comes with dual front stereo speakers and built-in Hi-Res audio support. The main camera is the same 20.7MP shooter as the previous model but the front gets a 5MP shooter for higher resolution selfies. On-board it gets 32GB of storage which can further be extended with the microSD slot. The non-removable battery is smaller at 2,930mAh capacity, but Sony reckons it still maintains its impressive battery life that runs up to 2 days thanks to its smart tweaks on both the display and processor. Overall it is just 6.9mm thick and weighs 144 grams. Out of the box, it runs on Android Lollipop with their latest UI on top. If you need a high-end smart phone that you can take to the swimming pool, the Xperia Z3+ could be your cup of tea. Hopefully Sony has sorted out its  overheating issues  caused by its processor. For the first 200 buyers, Sony will be throwing in a free Charging Dock worth RM139. You can order it now on their  online store  or at their participating outlets below:

With one “i” less, the Mi 4 gets a more upmarket metal frame and a much capable Snapdragon 801 Quad-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. Initially Xiaomi Malaysia is offering the Mi 4 through a  local distributor  based at the northern states, and it carries the hefty price tag of RM1,199. Now DirectD is offering the same device for just RM899 that comes with official Xiaomi Malaysia warranty. Should you get this? The deal breaker is whether you’ll need 4G connectivity as this Mi 4 only supports up to 3G WCDMA.    The Mi 4 offers a compact 5″ display that supports 1080p Full HD resolution and it has an on-board storage of 16GB with no memory card expansion. It also gets a 13MP f/1.8 main camera and a front facing 8MP f/1.8 shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 3,080mAh capacity battery which is slightly smaller than the Mi 4i.  For the ultimate experience, the best device being offered by Xiaomi Malaysia is the  Mi Note  which gets a larger 5.7″ Full HD screen, Hi-Fi audio capability, and a more premium metal and glass body. Of course, the price is much higher at RM1,549 but you do get 64GB of storage and support for 4G Dual-SIMs with dual active standby.

Although, fresh images seem to show the larger screen brother under its smaller sibling. This could provide the right edge for Samsung as they expand their range of “phablets” or large smartphones that already include the Note line. The screen size of the new device is stated to be around the 5.5 – 5.7 size, an up from the smaller 5.1’ display. There aren’t any other notable differences except the placement of the lower microphone that sits next to the headphone jack and possibly a different processor as shown in the image below. Essentially, those looking at purchasing the S6 edge+ will likely be looking at the same guts that powers the non-Plus phone, which for the sits high and mighty and well above other phones on the AnTuTu Benchmark ranking, except for the Galaxy S6. To jog the memory of those interested, the device is spearheaded by a Samsung Exynos 7420 running a Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 and  Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 that is coupled with 3GB of RAM. The combination of the two allow the device to get score of 62,373 with other higher end devices scoring 63,424 (Mi Note Pro), 52,709 (HTC One M9), and 52,266 (LG G Flex 2).

But with public interest in VR steadily on the rise we find ourselves with more and more options to escape reality. The  Samsung Gear VR  is one of those devices, produced in cooperation with the folks behind the Oculus Rift to bring a virtual reality experience like no other, or does it? Not to say it is the only VR experience out in the market, with  HTC  and Valve working together on the  HTC Vive  headset and  Sony  having their own VR project called  Project Morpheus , on top of Google Cardboard, whose simple nature has already allowed for widespread use of the device. In a nutshell, the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition is basically a pair of VR goggles that operates off your  Samsung Galaxy S6  or  S6 edge . To put it very bluntly, you could say it is a glorified Google Cardboard made of plastic with adjustable straps and lenses so it fits well on you head. The device mainly leverages off the Oculus’s own tech so the experience is actually quite similar to that of the Rift, if you’ve ever used it before. There is also another version of the Gear VR which accommodates the  Samsung Galaxy Note 4 , but it generally operates the same way and is similarly priced, albeit a bit larger to fit the bigger screen."

It seems that metal wraps around the devices edges of the OnePlus 2 and nothing to shout about regarding the right side of the phone though, where three of the usual buttons live – volume rockers and power button. However, there is a new inclusion on the left, which could very well be a dedicated camera button. Making up the back, in terms of texture, it looks similarly to the type of material used on the previous sandstone black model. A familiar camera model is placed lower this time around, and below that as well is what could be a laser autofocus module – giving some substantiation to OnePlus’ said emphasis on the camera on its newest device. Entrusted to give fans a preview of the device’s camera prowess,  Marques Brownlee  gave us an in-depth look at how the lens performs, as seen below. A steady slew of specifications have already been confirmed, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, USB Type-C connector and a 3,300 mAh battery. The TENAA certification also lists a 5.5″ Quad HD display (2560×1440 resolution), 32GB of storage and 13MP + 8MP camera combos. While these beefy insides would raise concerns to the budget-friendly, OnePlus maintains that it will cost less than 450 USD and yet still include a finger-print sensor that is most probably taking advantage of Android M’s compatibility. We hope all those sitting at home have their OnePlus Cardboards’ at the ready, for the official launching: if you haven’t yet, find someone who does, cause it’s been sold out since it first went on sale.

Alexander Wong,U Mobile’s #FreeInternetForLife prepaid plan gives Free High Speed Data like no other,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/22/u-mobiles-freeinternetforlife-prepaid-plan-gives-free-high-speed-data-like-no-other/,"#FreeInternetforLife,Free Internet,mobile internet,prepaid,Prepaid Internet,U Mobile,U Mobile Power Prepaid,U Mobile Prepaid","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-07-22,"UPDATE : U Mobile’s new  POWER prepaid  is now official. U Mobile will be announcing a  new product  tomorrow which will put other free internet offers to shame. From the recent  #FreeInternetForLife teasers , they are expected to do away with the usual pay per use charges for internet and will offer unlimited free “basic” internet out of the SIM pack. This is similar to what Maxis’  #Hotlink , Xpax’s  #MagicSIM  and Digi’s new  SMART prepaid  has to offer. But is that it? If U Mobile wants to shake up the industry, they have got to offer more than just free throttled internet. Ahead of its launch tomorrow, we managed to get a glimpse of U Mobile’s new prepaid plan and let’s just say that it could put even some postpaid plans to shame. 
 The new U Mobile prepaid not only offers free basic internet like the rest but it probably gives the most free high-speed data in the industry. A SIM pack costs RM8.50 and it comes with RM5 of credit with 10 days validity.  With just a one time minimum top up of RM10, U Mobile grants you 1GB of data for every 30 days for LIFE! Of course, this is provided that your prepaid account is active with regular top ups. As comparison, #MagicSIM gives 10MB and one day validity of free high speed data for every RM1 you top up. So a RM30 reload would give you 300MB that’s valid for 30 days inclusive of a couple of free calls or SMS. In terms of call rates, U Mobile charges a low 5 sen/30 seconds (10sen/min) and 8 sen/SMS, both of which are applicable to all networks. Upon activation, you get 200MB of high-speed data with the starter pack. In addition, they are giving up to 450 minutes of free calls to U Mobile users every month but subject to certain conditions which isn’t mentioned from the image above.  The launch is happening tomorrow so stay tuned as we update more details including its data top ups and other perks that might come included with this new affordable prepaid. If you haven’t already, do follow us on twitter at  @Soya_Cincau . Big thanks to  @KevinNgTK  for the awesome tip. [  SOURCE  ]"

Putting an end to the atrocious pay per use internet charges, the new U Mobile prepaid offers free basic internet just like other prepaid rivals. So there’s no more reason to panic over missing credit if you accidentally surf online without an active prepaid plan. The good stuff doesn’t just end there as POWER prepaid offers the most generous high-speed internet in the market. Following Celcom’s hyped  #MagicSIM offering  that comes with 10MB of free high speed internet for every RM1 you top up, U Mobile has up the ante with 1GB of free high-speed every month for life. All you’ll need to do is to top up RM10 one-time with the new SIM Pack and this is valid for registrations before 31st Dec 2015. The new U Mobile SIM Pack costs RM8.50 and inside it comes with RM5 credit preloaded. Upon activation, you’ll get 200MB of internet and 150 minutes of free calls within U Mobile. By default, the SIM pack comes with 10 days validity. In term of rates, it will cost 10sen/minute (30 seconds block) for voice calls and 8 sen per SMS to all networks. On top of that, U Mobile is offering 450 minutes of free calls to your friends and family who are on U Mobile’s network each month. This is given as a daily 15 minute free call quota during its active period. For those who need more than 1GB of data each month, you can top up more with its  UMI bundles  that are priced as follows: Even if you don’t top up, you can still continue to surf with no extra charge but speeds will be throttled. Existing U Mobile prepaid customers can make the switch starting 1st August but it will cost RM3. Overall it is an affordable plan for light to medium usage users. Will you be making the switch?"

The third gen Moto X has shown up in pictures a few times already, and this time its been spotted with a front facing flash. Its getting more common for brands to add front facing LED flashes to their flagship smartphones, considering that how well a phone can take a selfie does influence its sales. Motorola is likely trying to get in on the action and they have added a dual-LED flash for the rear camera as well. While we don’t yet know how many megapixels these snappers will be sporting, its not too far a leap to assume that it could be a 13 megapixel rear snapper, with either a 5 or 8 megapixel front camera. Other rumoured specs for the Moto X (2015) include 4GB RAM and a huge 3,280mAh battery, as well as a possible 5.5-5.7 inch screen, with the device set for a possible 28th July launch date.

Launching on 30th July to be exact, the Galaxy A8 offers a phablet size experience with a 5.7″ Full HD display and it comes with a  Galaxy S6  inspired design. The front display is a Full HD Super AMOLED unit that pushes a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels and underneath, it gets an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM, which is similar to its Galaxy A7 sibling. Internally it gets either 16GB or 32GB of on-board storage which can be extended with microSD.

Double tapping on the home button at anytime will automatically launches the camera app, just like the Galaxy S6. It is also worth pointing out that the home button also comes with a fingerprint scanner that unlocks with a single touch.

After announcing its top of the line  Honor 7 , they have just revealed its latest entry-level offering, the Honor 4A which is priced from just 599 CNY (about RM365). This looks like an improvement over its previous cheap and cheerful  Honor 3C  and this time it supports dual-SIMs and 4G LTE with extensive support for all Chinese networks.  For starters, it gets a decent 5″ HD 720p IPS display which is impressive in this price range. Instead of a MediaTek processor, the Honor 4A runs on Qualcomm’s  Snapdragon 210  which is an entry-level Quad-Core processor with 4G LTE support that’s clocked at 1.1GHz. To ensure that you have a decent multi-tasking experience, it gets 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM and there’s 8GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD up to 128GB extra. The Honor 4A also gets a basic 8MP f/2.0 main camera and a front facing 2MP selfie cam. Powering the device is a 2,200mAh capacity battery which is rated to last 1.5 days with average use and up to 5 days with power saving mode enabled. Despite its low price tag, the Honor 4A gets a metal looking frame while the back cover has a laser cut engraving effect for a more upmarket feel.  For better audio, it has bottom mounted speakers which makes it louder than its previous entry-level models. Overall it weighs 155 grams and it has a decent thickness of 8.5mm. Out of the box, it runs on their proprietary EMUI 3.1 skin which is layered on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop.  For the price and the specs, the Honor 4A is going head on with Xiaomi’s  Redmi 2A , which is a cheaper version of its Redmi 2. While the overall package is impressive for its price, we are not too sure about the use of Qualcomm’s 1.1GHz Quad Core Snapdragon 210 processor. With 2GB of RAM on-board, the Honor 4A could be decent enough for basic web browsing and social updates.  For more info, you can check out Huawei’s  Honor 4A  product page. [  SOURCE  ]"

Alternatively you can consider this option from Incipio.

This however isn’t connected all the time. At the side, there’s a switch which lets you choose to either charge the device or to enable its microSD storage. Whether you’re using a Galaxy S6 or the S6 edge with a double edge display, the Incipio offgrid supports both models with the inclusion of 2 front bumper designs in the box. Since the case adds a little bulk, some headphones may not fit thought the case and they have provided a headphone extension as a workaround.

Now a purported dummy phone of the S6 edge+ has  appeared  and with no surprises, it looks like a stretched S6 edge. As you would expect, it has the same exterior design with its 5.1″ standard edge model including a double curve screen at the front. When compared to the Galaxy Note 4, it does look larger than its purported 5.3-5.4″ display size. The Galaxy Note 4 gets a 5.7″ Quad HD AMOLED display and judging from the picture above, the S6 edge+ might be having a similar screen size.  Looking at the sides, the metal frame looks thicker than the standard S6 edge. With a bigger screen, the S6 edge+ is expected to get a larger which is likely to be 3,000mAh or more.

In the face of  declining tablet sales , Samsung still thinks there’s still a market for premium tablets and the new one now comes with a 4:3 display aspect ratio that’s similar to the iPad Air and iPad mini series. For starters, it will come in 2 sizes, 8.0″ and 9.7″ inches, which is similar to what its  Galaxy Tab A  has to offer. The display on both models are using Super AMOLED with a resolution of 2048×1536 pixels. While that’s the same as what iPad Retina Displays have to offer, it is lower than the current Galaxy Tab S which gives a higher Quad HD 2600×1600 pixels resolution.  In terms of design, this is Samsung’s thinnest and lightest tablets at only 5.6mm thick and it weighs from just 265 grams for the 8.0″ WiFi only model. It gets a premium metal frame around the sides like its current flagship smart phones and the home button also features a one touch fingerprint scanner.

Storage wise, you get either 32GB of 64GB on-board and thankfully it still gets a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB.  For imaging, it gets a 8MP AF main camera and a front facing 2.1MP unit which is isn’t much to shout about.  Battery wise, the 9.7″ is juiced up with a 5,870mAh capacity unit while the 8.0″ version gets 4,000mAh. As comparison, the previous model had a larger battery at 7,900mAh (Tab S 10.5) and 4,900mAh (Tab S 8.4).  Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop and both sizes will be offered in both WiFi only and 4G LTE variants depending on selected markets. There’s no S-Pen, so if you fancy to scribble something on the go, the Galaxy Tab A is your only choice at the moment. If we can summarise, the Galaxy Tab S2 offers better specs and materials but it sacrifices on display and battery. In terms of price, the Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 is listed at 399 Euro (about RM1,643) for WiFi and 469 Euro (about RM1,931) for LTE, while the larger 9.7″ version is going for 499 Euro (about RM2,055) for WiFi and 569 Euro (about RM2,343) for LTE. Both models are expected to go on sale globally starting next month in August. As usual, it comes with a variety accessories including a keyboard that hooks on with matching colours.

The message is vague by saying “move 4 to double” but the outline of the image clearly shows a shaded outline of a “3” and many will jump to the conclusion that the match sticks that make up the 6 can easily be rearranged to a “2”. In timely fashion, the 32GB capacity device could land during India’s celebration of Xiaomi’s anniversary, the 22 nd  of July – a day from now. At the beginning of the product launch, those who were interested were left with a bad taste in their mouth due to the lack of external storage and a disappointingly low internal memory of 16GB. As the device might receive a bump in the storage department, it’s highly unlikely that there will be changes in the original Mi 4i spec sheet, which include a 5-inch IPS display that is full HD ready (1920 x 1080 pixels), a second-gen Octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor clocked at 1.7GHz, mated with 2GB of RAM and a 13-megapixel rear + 5 megapixel front camera lens. Powering all of this is a 3,120 mAh battery and supplementing the cellular connectivity is a dual SIM option, LTE supported. For more info regarding the RM 749 priced Mi 4i be sure to check out our review  here  and while there is no official pricing mentioned, if there’s a release of the 32 GB model, it would be roughly an increase of RM 150 +- given that the  ASUS Zenfone 2  pricing increase hovers around the same mark. Malaysians will have to wait to see if we’ll receive the 32GB variant on our shores but be sure to be on the look-out following the anniversary in India.

The Mirror keeps true to its namesake with glass donning the rear of the device, accented with glistening prims that will allow an occasional double take from onlookers. Eager owners can choose between an Ivory White and Midnight Blue, while the innards are beefed up by a bi-metallic frame to improve sturdiness. The 7.65 mm slate, allows photo-enthusiast and amateurs alike to fully take charge with a slew of features accompanying the rear 8 megapixel and 5 megapixel front shutters. The lenses comes in at a f/2.2 aperture lens along with the ability of slow shutter, audio photo, double exposure and other notable OPPO camera features. Its big brother definitely comes up tops, as the R1x is equip with an f/2.0 sensor for the 13 megapixel rear and 5 megapixel front. Hardware wise, a 64 bit 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 Quad-core processor powers this nifty phone, and is helped along by 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage that is expandable to 128 GB with a micro SD card. This sits well below the Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, of the R1x. The screen however is a mere 960 x 540 5-inch display, that sits just well enough, considering it’ll be priced lower than the OPPO R1x: that pushes higher pixels – 1280 x 720, in its 5-inch IPS HD panel. Battery on the other hand, stands at 2420 mAh – non-removable. Going along the trend of allowing users to use two SIMs, OPPO does the same for the Mirror 5. There will also be a LTE variant dubbed the Mirror 5s, however OPPO has yet to mention dates for both of these devices. For more info you can check out  OPPO’s Mirror 5  product page."

Given the official announcement will be live before today’s end, all the details that are rumoured will be known for sure but we hope it’ll be the cheapest Honor yet! [  SOURCE  ,  VIA  ]"
Cheryl Bates,Samsung Galaxy Tab A: Productivity tablet that’s nothing much else,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/21/samsung-galaxy-tab-a-8-0-review-malaysia/,,,2015-07-21,"It’s been a while since Samsung last launched a tablet. With their Galaxy Note series of phablets doing rather well it’s a wonder that they are still interested in producing a similar product the tablet segment. The latest member of the family is none other than the Samsung Galaxy Tab A; a new range of tablets that supports telephony features with the productivity of an S Pen. Generally the tablet looks like one geared towards users looking for productivity with a little bit of entertainment thrown into the mix, considering the specs are decent enough to get some gaming in or hash out your daily report if you aren’t the sort to drag your laptop about.  But how does the tablet actually measure up, especially when there are cheaper tablets that are capable better, like its direct competitor the Xiaomi Mi Pad? Let’s find out. The Galaxy Tab A comes in 2 sizes – a compact 8 incher or a full sized 9.7 inch unit. For this review, we’re given the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 in dark grey. As far as the looks go, the tablet is very similar to the  Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4  in terms of sharing the same material design and feel. However the Tab A is mostly built out of plastic with a rounded metal rim on the face of the device, it does a decent job in looking premium at the very least. The Tab A isn’t the thinnest or the lightest though with the tablet being 7.5mm thick at its thinnest point and weighing in at about 338g, it’s rather substantial. The tablet is priced at RM 1,299 which is hardly cheap with all the sub RM 1,000 tablets there are running around in the market; with the roughly similar Mi Pad retailing for just RM 799 though it cannot make phone calls nor does it come with a versatile pen. For those who want a tablet that can make phone calls there are other alternatives out there like the  ASUS fonePad  series or maybe even the  Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact  if you have the cash, although you are still going to look silly when you have a  big tablet stuck to your face.  But it looks like Malaysians and people around the Asian region seem to really dig it despite it looking rather inconvenient."

With half of 2015 gone and there are newer flagships sporting Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor, the Galaxy S6 continues to reign supreme thanks to its 64-bit 14nm Exynos 7420 processor, 3GB of LP-DDR4 RAM and a faster  Universal Flash Storage . Antutu has just released a summary of top performance devices for the first half of 2015 where the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge occupies the top 2 spots with over 60,000 points, followed by Xiaomi’s  Mi Note Pro  at over 57,000 points. The Mi Note Pro is the highest performing Snapdragon 810 smart phone to date, and it uses the latest V2.1 processor version with better cooling and it is mated to 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. The list continues with LeTV’s 1 Pro, ZTE Nubia Z9 Max and also HTC One M9, scoring slightly above the 50,000 mark. At the moment, only the Exynos 7420 processor on the S6/S6 edge has managed to break the 60,000 barrier which accounts to 20% share of top performing devices tested on Antutu. Qualcomm’s former flagship processor, the Snapdragon 805 also takes up 20% share on Antutu. The new MediaTek MT6795 processor which currently powers the HTC One M9+ holds just 10%, while Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 810 holds the biggest share at 50%. Looking at the trend throughout the past few years, 2015 marks an exponential growth in top-line performance where we see a jump of nearly 20,000 points from 2014. As comparison, the previous years had leaped about 13,000-14,000 points on an annual basis. It is also worth pointing out that Samsung is getting better with its in-house processor development and they are slowly reducing its dependency on Qualcomm chips, at least for its high-end models for now. Even Huawei’s Hi-Silicon processors are getting better since its Kirin 920 that made its debut on the Honor 6. Meanwhile Qualcomm, which was once the dominant choice for top up smart phones is having a rough time battling its  Snapdragon 810  processor issues. Even for the upcoming  OnePlus 2 , the processor will be clocked at a lower 1.8GHz speeds for better thermal performance and stability. Qualcomm hopes to make up for lost ground with their upcoming  Snapdragon 820 processor  which is expected to be available by end 2015 or early 2016. What do you look for in your next flagship device? Is the type of processor a big deal? Let us know in the comments below. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

A dummy set of the 3rd gen Moto G for 2015 was spotted and it comes with the usual key selling features sticker at the front. Interestingly there’s an IPX7 icon which means it will be more water resistant than before.  While the icon indicates that it is resistant to rain, the  IPX7 rating  means that it has been certified to be submerged under 1 metre of water and for up to 30 minutes. This is similar to the HTC  Re Camera  that’s water resistant out of the box without the use of extra casing. Of course, it is also subject to the brand’s faith on its water resistance as we’ve seen how the Galaxy S5 and even the Apple Watch being discouraged from underwater use despite having sufficient resistance on paper.  Just to recap on what we know so far about the Moto G, it will retain most of the same specs as the previous model with a couple of updated tweaks. The front display is still a 5 incher with HD 720p resolution and it will run on a newer Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage which can be expanded with microSD.  Word has it that a higher-spec 2GB RAM version would be introduced as well. In terms of imaging, the camera will be getting a bump to a 13MP main and a 5MP front selfie cam. It will be running on the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop and the battery is said to be a 2,470 mAh capacity. The Moto G will be  announced  next week on 28th July and it would be likely joined by a couple of new models including the Moto X. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The latest one has Google working with Huawei and Twitter tipster  @evleaks  has dropped some hints on whats to come on the device. The new Nexus apparently will be home to a 5.7 inch QHD display as well as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC with custom Kyro cores. Externally, the device will have a metal body and a fingerprint scanner, though it hasn’t been confirmed yet if it will be a metal unibody. The  fingerprint scanner  isn’t too big of a surprise considering  Android M  does have native support for the tech, not to mention they are becoming increasingly popular on some flagship smartphones. Signs are pointing towards a rather premium build, what with the high-res screen and powerful processor. The device is rumoured to be hitting the market sometime in Q4 so we’ve got quite some time yet for more information about this Huawei made Nexus phone to appear, but so far it’s looking quite promising.

But this doesn’t bode well for iPod lovers as the only member of the family that can access Apple’s new music service is just the Touch, with the possibility of leaving the rest to fade into obscurity. The new iPod Touch has gotten an upgrade from its older A5 processor in favour of a newer 64-bit A8 chip which was also used in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The rear camera has been given an upgrade from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixels and storage starts at 16GB and goes all the way to 128GB should you need such massive storage. The device will be available in blue, pink, red, silver, space grey and a new gold shade. With the vast majority of people using their phones to listen to their music, the relevance of dedicated music players are somewhat questionable now, especially with the prevalence of music streaming services. Granted there are still some brands producing said Mp3 and media players, but these have decreased dramatically as music streaming is now the norm and a larger percentage of people own smartphones. Its hard to say if the refresher will bring the devices back into popularity, but the Touch is still the cheapest entry into becoming an iOS user.

After the recent leaks and rumours, the Moto G is finally going to be revealed and it looks like it will be joined by a couple of other devices. A new surprise is the Moto X 2015, which is their top end offering and it is expected to run on a Snapdragon 810 processor. Apart from the usual suspects, there will be a couple of new “Droids” which will be exclusive to US’s Verizon network. 
 In terms of specs, the Moto G is a refreshed mid-range offering but despite its 3rd generation release, it gets almost the same specs as the previous model. From the leaks we’ve seen, it will get a similar 5″ HD 720p display, a Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage and 13MP + 5MP cameras. For those who demand more, it is alleged that Motorola will be preparing a higher-spec version that comes with 2GB of RAM.  Meanwhile the Moto X is said to be a much larger device with a possible 5.7″ screen but we think they are going be to sticking to something smaller than 5.5″ for now. What we do hope is that Motorola will increase its battery capacity since the  current one  gets just 2,300mAh. Based on earlier  rumours , the Moto X might get 4GB of RAM and will be juiced up with a larger 3,280mAh capacity battery. Probably the biggest change for the latest Moto G/X series is the back design where it gets a more rugged looking appearance with a rubbery grip. Apart from being one of the first devices to get the latest Android updates, Motorola will face an uphill battle against other cheap and cheerful offering especially from its rival Chinese brands.

Named the Mi Water Purifier, the water filtration device is aimed at getting you clean water fast without taking up too much space in the kitchen. Heath is a pretty big concern for the average Chinese citizen, given that the water is not treated well enough to make it directly drinkable, which is common in most Asian countries. As such, water filters are pretty much a household necessity. The Water Purifier works by transforming tap water into drinkable purified water via reverse osmosis (RO) to remove impurities and pathogens by utilising pressure. It does this by way of four filters that comprise of a cotton filter followed by a activated coconut carbon filter and finally a reverse osmosis membrane before hitting one last carbon filter before it reaches your cup. This is supposed to not just remove all the bad stuff from your water but also make it taste better. The system has a footprint smaller than that of a piece of A4 paper, measuring in at 205 x 260 x410mm so it doesn’t occupy too much space on your sink. Your water is also supposedly filtered a lot faster too, with the system operating at x8 the speed of generic filters making it capable of churning out up to 400 gallons of filtered water a day. It also wastes less water with a 1:1 water production rate to be more efficient. There’s even an app you can use to manage the device, telling you how clean your water is and when its time to clean the filters. On top of simple three step installation, you will get six faucet adapters that are compatible with most tap heads so you can get to using the purifier immediately. The Mi Water Purifier will retail for RMB 1,299 (about RM 796) and like most of Mi’s fancier gadgets, we probably won’t be seeing it sold here officially. For more info, you can check out the  Mi Water Purifier  product page. More promo videos and images below."

Xiaomi has sent out invites for a local launch event that’s happening next week on 22nd July. The Mi Note which was launched in China earlier this year had passed its  SIRIM certification  several months ago but it remained exclusive for the Chinese market until now. Just recently, Mi Hong Kong has announced that it will  commence Mi Note sales  starting next Tuesday and it looks like the 5.7″ phablet is rolling out to more international markets in the coming weeks. To recap on the specs, the Mi Note has a 5.7″ Full HD display, 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 Quad-Core processor with 3GB RAM and comes with either 16GB or 64GB of storage. At the back, it has a 13MP OIS main and a front facing 4MP shooter, that’s similar to HTC’s Ultrapixel camera. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery and overall it weighs 161 grams with a thickness of 6.95mm. the display like the  Mi 4i  has pixel level adjustments which self optimises for better visibility under bright daylight.  In terms of build, the Mi Note gets a premium metal frame with a glass back that curves towards the sides. It is a dual-SIM device and as usual, it  won’t get microSD expansion  like the rest of their flagship products.  For those who want something better, there’s a Mi Note Pro which is not likely to debut in the coming launch next week. That gets a 2K Quad HD display, a 2GHz Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor and 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. On the exterior it shares the same dimensions but it gets a distinctive gold colour frame to separate itself from the standard Mi Note.  If we are getting the same treatment as Hong Kong, we could be getting the larger 64GB version. It is sold at 2,999 HKD (about RM1,473) in Hong Kong and 2,499 CNY (about RM1,533) in China. So it looks like it could be priced around the RM1,500 range when it gets here. We’ll be at the launch so stay tuned for more details.

Word has it that both of these models will be launched earlier than usual, where the Note series is often launched during  IFA  in early September every year. To get an early start in sales and to avoid clashing with the upcoming iPhone 6S announcement, the new Galaxy Note 5 and S6 edge+ is said to be launch on  12 August  and it could go on sale before the end of August. If that’s not convincing enough, both models have just passed certification in Singapore’s IDA database with the Galaxy Note 5 carrying the model number SM-N920I while the Galaxy S6 edge+ having the number SM-G928I. At least now we can confirm the product names and there will be a larger  S6 edge  instead of a  Galaxy Note edge  replacement with an S-Pen. In terms of design, both the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ would carry over its premium glass and metal unibody approach just like its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge. This also means that the new models are likely to lose its removable battery and expandable microSD slots. Spec-wise the Galaxy Note 5 will get a 5.67″ Quad HD display and under the hood, it could be running on their latest Exynos all-in-one chip that integrates its Octa-Core processor, RAM, storage, GPU and modem in a single unit. As you would expect from a brand new flagship, it will come with 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. It is also rumoured to carry a 4,100mAh battery, which is a huge upgrade from the current Note 4. As for the S6 edge+, earlier it was rumoured to carry a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor like the LG G4. However most recently it has been said that it will have similar specs as its current Galaxy S6/S6 edge with a Exynos 7420 processor and 3GB of RAM. After all, the S6 is still a  benchmark beast , outdoing the rest with a big gap. The only differences between the S6 edge+ and the standard S6 edge that’s known so far is slightly bigger screen of about 5.3″-5.4″ and a larger 3,000mAh battery. With Malaysia as a key market for Samsung, we could be getting both devices by early September. If you’re itching for a new Galaxy Note, are you looking forward to this? [  SOURCE   2  ]"

With that the super sleek Mi TV 2S is now official, which is claimed to be as thin as their  Mi 4  smartphone which was launched last year. The TV is to feature 4K support as well as a unique super compact plughead which is a first for smart TVs. The Mi TV 2S is the updated version of the  2nd gen   Mi TV , with the smart TV coming in a variety of sizes and colour options we don’t normally see on a display, with the aluminium frame to sport either pink, blue, lime, gold or silver colour configurations to spiffy up your living room. This time it looks like the display will only be available in one 48 inch configuration, but it will feature lossless 4K video support as well. It may be thin, but its still not as skinny as  Sony’s thinnest display  which rolls in at about 4.9mm thick whereas the display here is 9.9mm thick. In terms of specs, the display is equipped with an MStar 6A928 flagship processor mated to 2GB RAM as well as 8GB internal storage with the entire thing running on the MIUI TV operating system based on Android 5.0 Lollipop. The brand has also developed their own independent sound system to go with the Mi TV 2S Theatre edition, which runs off Dolby sound tech. The system comprises of 2 silk tweeters, 6 full range speakers, a 6.5 inch passive radiator and 6.5 inch subwoofer. They claim that the new system sounds better than a Bose Cinemate 1 SR but we’ll save judgement for real world testing. Also something to mention here is that they’ve given the power plug an overhaul, moving away from the larger more familiar plug to this tiny one that only takes up half the space. Doesn’t look like it would work with Malaysian plug points though, if the picture is any indication. The Mi TV 2S will be retailing for RMB 2,999 (about RM 1839) for the standard version and RMB 3,999 (about RM 2452) for the theatre edition which is a pretty sweet deal for a display that size. We probably won’t be getting the Mi TV 2S here just yet, but we will be sure to let you know if it decides to hit the market here.

Realising that specs are equally as important as the outside, the fine smart phone maker has stepped up its game with better spec-ed smart phones like the  Vertu Aster  and  Vertu for Bentley . Obviously everyone would demand top notch internals especially if you’re forking more than RM20,000 for a phone.

Considering this is a huge privacy concern because it pretty much affects any Android device, there’s thankfully a way to stop Google Photos from continuing to save your data to the cloud. Google Photos  is more of a  viewing app  that lets users look at images stored on their device and their account, with the service syncing to the cloud irrespective of whether or not you are actually using it. By right uninstalling the app should get it to stop, but Google loves data and it also loves storing it so you’re essentially stuck here.  Personally we feel that leaving a data trail a mile wide is a huge problem, especially if you don’t feel comfortable with your device quietly doing stuff you don’t want it to. On the plus side, the photos won’t become public unless you personally review and approve them. Luckily the solution is pretty simple. All you need to do is head over to your Settings, then to Accounts and finally Google. From there select your main Google account and uncheck the “Sync Photos” option to stop it in its tracks.

Thinnest Samsung Smart Phone at 5.9mm,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/15/samsung-galaxy-a8-now-official-thinnest-samsung-smart-phone-at-5-9mm/,"Android,galaxy a8,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A,samsung galaxy a8,samsung galaxy A8 malaysia,Samsung Galaxy A8 Malaysia Spec,Samsung Galaxy A8 Official,Smart Phone dual SIM","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-07-15,"After  tons of leaks , the  Galaxy A8  is now official with a thickness of just 5.9mm. While it won’t break any new world records, the Galaxy A8 is the thinnest smart phone that Samsung has ever produced, beating its previous 6.3mm record on the  Galaxy A7 .  From the exterior design, it still maintains the same unibody approach like the rest of its Galaxy A series but the A8 inherits some design cues from their current flagship. For starters, the metal frame has some chiseled design and the front looks like a larger Galaxy S6. Even the home button has a fingerprint scanner which unlocks at a single touch. With a bigger model number, the Galaxy A8 has a 5.7″ Full HD Super AMOLED display, which is 0.2″ larger than the Galaxy A7. Under the hood, it gets a similar Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor (4x 1.5GHz, 4x 1.0GHz) that’s mated to 2GB of RAM and has 16GB or 32GB of on-board storage. The Galaxy A8 for China supports 4G LTE and it has dual-SIM slots, but the 2nd slot is a hybrid where it doubles up as a microSD slot which accepts up to 128GB capacity. In the imaging department, the main shooter is a 16MP camera with f/1.9 that’s similar to the Galaxy S6. For the front, it gets a wide angle 5MP shooter. Double tapping the home button will launch the camera app at anytime and it also supports wide selfie as well.  With a larger screen, the Galaxy A8 gets a decent 3,050mAh capacity battery, which is about 17% larger than the Galaxy A7 which comes with a 2,600mAh unit. The Galaxy A8 is 10 grams heavier at 151g. For Malaysia, the Galaxy A8 was recently spotted in SIRIM’s database and word has it that it would be  released  with a RM1,888 price tag.

After revamping its postpaid offering with  heaps of data , U Mobile is set to announce a new product that’s said to be a game changer for its segment. We think this could be a new prepaid product and it is likely to offer free unlimited basic internet similar to  #Hotlink ,  #MagicSIM  and the new  Digi Smart Prepaid . Effectively this could put an end to pay per use charges for internet which U Mobile currently charges RM0.20/MB.   Without giving specific details, they teased that it will offer more data and voice allocation plus extra services to help you stay connected. Apart from free throttled internet and perhaps more freebies, what could U Mobile do to shake up the industry? We’ll find out more from their media event next week, 23rd July after the Hari Raya holidays, so stay tuned."
soyacincau,TM Unifi now offers faster speeds for less but with some compromises,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/14/tm-unifi-now-offers-faster-speeds-for-less-but-with-some-compromises/,"HSBB,New Unifi Plans,TM,TM Unifi,TM Unifi 30Mbps,TM Unifi 30Mbps Upload,TM Unifi Asymmetrical Speed,TM Unifi Plans,Unifi 30Mbps,Unifi 50Mbps,Unifi 50Mbps Upload","Players on the Field,TM,UniFi",2015-07-14,"Ever since TM had  launched its Unifi  High Speed Broadband service 5 years ago, nothing much has changed when it comes to their Home broadband plans. Just recently we had a glimpse of its faster  30Mbps and 50Mbps options  but they are limited to selected test areas within the Klang Valley. You could get 50Mbps for only RM263.94/month (inclusive of GST) which is the same price as their current VIP 20 plan with 20Mbps connectivity. The folks at Lowyat had just  confirmed  that the new plans are now officially available in all Unifi service areas. So now you can enjoy 30Mbps speeds at RM210.94 a month, which is the same price as their current 10Mbps plan. While it sounds good, there are some differences you should know before making the switch. TM’s current VIP Home Plans – VIP 5, VIP 10 and VIP 20 are having symmetrical bandwidth where you get the same upload speeds as your download speeds. So if you signed up for VIP 10, you get 10Mbps speeds for both download and uploads.  For the new 30Mbps and 50Mbps plans, the speeds are asymmetrical where its upload speeds are much slower than downloads. The new 30Mbps plan gets just 5Mbps for upload while its 50Mbps plan settles for 10Mbps. Is this a big deal? It all depends on your usage. For normal web browsing, video and music streaming, 30Mbps for download is a significant jump from 10Mbps and the lower upload speeds shouldn’t be much of an issue.  However if you upload a lot content especially Full HD or 4K videos, the 5Mbps upload speed would be a bottleneck. It will be the same story as well if plan on uploading huge files or doing video broadcast from your home. Despite a dip in upload speeds, the new Unifi plans are still offering unlimited quota until further notice.  Another big difference is the lack of free landline phone calls. For the current VIP plans, each subscriber can make unlimited phone calls for free to any TM fixed line nationwide. Meanwhile phone calls to mobile numbers are charged at 11sen/minute, which is quite reasonable. On the new 30Mbps/50Mbps plan, there are no free calls included and all calls will be charged at 21sen/minute for both domestic fixed lines and mobile numbers. If someone in your household is making a lot of phone calls especially to land lines, you can top up additional RM21.20/month for its voice pack that gives you 600 minutes of voice calls to any local number. After finishing your 600 minutes, you can still make unlimited phone calls to any fixed line for free, while extra calls to mobile numbers are charged at 11 sen/minute.  By default, all Unifi subscribers get HyppTV with a couple of free channels bundled in. On the newer 30Mbps/50Mbps plans, you get the extra option of either HyppTV Aneka, Varnam or Ruby Packs, which is about 9-12 extra channels depending on your choice. It all depend on your usage. If symmetrical connectivity with higher upload speed and unlimited phone calls are critical, the existing VIP plans would be your preferred option. If 5Mbps upload is sufficient and download speeds are more important, the newer plans offer faster download speeds for less. Essentially the new plans give you more than 2X the download speed but it cuts down your uploads by half for the same monthly subscription. Phone calls to fixed lines are now chargeable on the new plans but you can top up extra RM21.20 each month for the same option as before. To balance the lack of phone calls would be the additional HyppTV channels that you’ll get at no extra charge.  The new plans are available and you can sign up at your nearest TM Point outlet. However do note that existing subscribers will be tied to a fresh 2 year contract when you make the switch. So if you’re on TM’s VIP 10 and VIP 20 plans, would you switch to these newer option? Let us know in the comments below. [  SOURCE  ]"
Sirap Bandung,The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ and Note 5 tipped to launch August 12,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/15/the-samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-and-note-5-tipped-to-launch-august-12/,"galaxy note 5,galaxy S6 edge,mobile device,rumour mill,Samsung,samsung galaxy note 5,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Plus","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-07-15,"We’ve been hearing off and on that the  Samsung Galaxy Note 5  is set to be launched soon, and according to new information it will be launched on August 12th, alongside the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. The report also brings to light some new details about the phones as well. For starters the Galaxy Note 5 will look like a larger version of the  Galaxy S6  smartphone and won’t have a microSD slot, but will be home to a very thin bezel. The S Pen will also has apparently undergone a bit of an evolution, making it look more like a pen and it will share the same colour as the smartphone it belongs to. Other rumoured specs include an octa-core 64 bit processor, 4GB RAM and a 4,100mAh battery. So far the  Mi Note Pro  and the upcoming  OnePlus 2 are the only devices that officially use the same type (LPDDR4) of RAM. For the S6 edge+ on the other hand, is said to have Samsung’s home brewed Exynos 7420 SoC under the hood instead of a Snapdragon 808 chipset. There will also be 3GB RAM for the device, which is the same amount of memory residing in the Galaxy S6. In terms of other specs, the S6 edge+ is expected to have a 16 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front snapper as well as a 3,000mAh battery plus 32GB internal storage. The Note 5 will be available in silver, gold, white and black colour options and both devices are apparently set to go on sale starting August 21st. No word yet on what the pricing will look like, but we expect that they will be close to that of the original flagships. [ VIA ,  1 ][ SOURCE ]"

This newest leak basically tells us that the Moto G might be the first of the series to be eligible for MotoMaker customization (which was originally available for the Moto X) that lets you tweak your phone’s looks before you order it from the company. The image above is just a taste of what you could possibly do with the budget phone with the huge array of colourful backplate options but so far its been confirmed that you won’t be able to modify your buttons. As part of the customisation options available, the RAM as well as DTV might also be part of the program. It would make sense for the phone to have its prices marked up slightly should this become available, especially for the extra RAM variant. However do keep in mind that if the device does make it onto MotoMaker it will be an option only available for certain markets. We are still eagerly awaiting the launch of Motorola’s new device so fingers crossed that they are going to launch on 28th July as rumoured. [ VIA ,  1 ][ SOURCE ,  1 ]"

The  Galaxy S6  is still the most advanced Android smart phone at the moment but for those prefer bigger phones, the new  Galaxy Note 5  launch is just right around the corner. Taking its performance up a notch, Samsung will still be using its in-house developed Exynos processor but this time it will combine its Octa-Core 64-bit processor, RAM, GPU, LTE modem and storage into a single chip solution. In terms of RAM, the folks at Sammobile had confirmed that the Galaxy Note 5 will join the big boys by offering 4GB of LP-DDR4 RAM. So far the  Mi Note Pro  and the upcoming  OnePlus 2  are the only devices that officially use the same type (LPDDR4) of RAM. The upcoming Galaxy Note 5 has been said to feature a 5.67″ Quad HD display, which is slightly smaller than its current Galaxy Note 4 and of course it will come with its signature S-Pen stylus. Like the Galaxy S6, it will use glass for both front and back, so it is likely that you won’t get a removable battery but it will definitely have wireless charging built-in.   In terms of camera, the front unit is speculated to have the same 5MP sensor as the current Galaxy S6 but it would be further assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation. A purported  FAQ  has appeared on Samsung’s website on its OIS front camera but strangely it mentions the entire Galaxy S6 range despite the S6 and S6 edge not having hardware based stabilisation for the front cameras.  Usually Samsung would launch the Galaxy Note series during IFA that’s held around September each year but now it is rumoured that they might launch it earlier in August. Apparently Samsung has been pressured to do so due to less than expected sales performance of its current S6 flagships. Furthermore this could also give Samsung extra sales lead time before the new  iPhone 6S  is announced later this year. For the launch, Samsung has been reported countless of times that they won’t release a new  Galaxy Note edge  variant. Instead, they would release a larger version of its Galaxy S6 edge that could be named as the S6 edge Plus. It would look the same as the current Galaxy S6 edge but it gets a larger 5.3-5.4″ display with curve edges for both sides.  Since it isn’t a Note series, it won’t carry an S-Pen stylus and it will be positioned slightly lower than the new Note 5 with a Snapdragon 808 processor on-board. With both the S6 edge Plus and Galaxy Note 5 launched at the same time, we might see a smaller price gap in between and consumers would then need to decide if they prefer to have the S-Pen or a double-edge display. Do you think Samsung’s flagship approach is too fast for its own good? And would you sacrifice the S-Pen for a larger double curved display? Leave your comments below. [  SOURCE   2   3  ]"

As usual, there are several accounts of what really happened including one that claims to be a cheating case between a buyer and seller. Kuala Lumpur’s CID chief has  mentioned  that the incident was pure thuggery and it isn’t racially driven as some quarters might have posted on Facebook.  On the allegation of selling fake phones, OPPO Malaysia has immediately issued a statement that they are taking a hard stance on counterfeit products. OPPO is having a challenge of tackling  counterfeit OPPO smart phones  in our local market and they urged consumers to purchase only from their authorised outlets. They maintained that their official outlets, dealers, distributors and partners are carefully selected to provide the highest quality of service and most importantly to sell genuine OPPO products.  Ever since they started operations in Malaysia, OPPO has highlighted a number of fake products which can be seen even at Pasar Malam. A few months back, they shared a couple of photos and video of a fake  OPPO N3 . To protect consumers better, they had  even released  an  online IMEI checking tool  to verify if the serial number of the device is a genuine unit. As mentioned before, they  urge consumers  who have been duped with clone units to make a formal report to the authorities for further action. In a separate incident last year, one of our readers had been sold a  fake Redmi Note  which was shoddy in build quality and it uses inferior specs. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check out his detailed  video comparison  between a genuine and fake Redmi Note.  1. Approach the Seller/Shop 
The first step is to try to settle with the person that sold you the product. You’ll need to produce a receipt that includes the matching serial number of the device. Inform that that you’ve been sold an imitation unit and demand for a replacement or a full refund. 2. Report to the Ministry 
If the seller refuses to entertain your requests, the next best step would be to report to the Ministry of Domestic Trade. You can drop them  an email  which they will respond within 3 working days. Do attach the full details including your receipt, device model and the shop that you’ve purchased from. Whatever happens, stay calm and resolve your issue through the authorities. As always, buy only from authorised outlets and if a deal is too good to be true, it probably is."

This particular smartphone has already been leaked multiple times, with each leak detailing the phone more and more. The images we see here are in line with what has been shown off so far, down to the rear buttons. The case does appear to have textured and nontextured versions so, these could be backplate variants much like what the previous gen Moto G had as well. In terms of specs the device is expected to have a 64-bit Snapdragon 410 processor mated to 1GB RAM, 8GB storage and LTE support. It’s great that the processor is getting an update but weirdly the phone isn’t getting any extra RAM or storage. The budget smartphone will also be home to a 5 inch 1280 x 720 display as well as a 13 megapixel rear snapper and 5 megapixel front facing camera. Apart from being among the first to run on the very latest flavour of Android, the Moto G specs look underwhelming against today’s cheap and cheerful offering from China. The R edmi 2 Enhanced version  for example is having similar specs but it gets double the amount of RAM and storage for less than RM500.  The phone is expected to be released sometime in September if they are following their Fall release schedule, but plenty of this could still change between then and now.

If you need more data for your SurfMore 50/75 plan, Maxis is now charging just RM15 per 1GB extra. This is the same rate as before but they still omit its previous 5GB for RM50 top up option for heavy usage subscribers. Nevertheless, it is still significantly cheaper than what they have been charging recently.  As part of their Raya promotion, new and existing SurfMore 50 customers will be getting  extra 2GB of data  for 6 months starting from July until December 2015. This gives you a total of 4GB for just RM50/month. Not as cheap as the rest, but it is better than nothing.  Meanwhile, its current MaxisOne Plan that offers unlimited calls and SMS is still  charging  RM30 for 1GB. For heavy usage, they are offering 3GB at RM58 or 6GB at RM116, which comes up to RM19.33/GB.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Just recently a new model has just passed TENAA, China’s certification body and this gives us the first dibs on what to expect with the upcoming affordable phablet.  In terms of design, it looks more squarish with a matte looking finishing similar to its current  Mi 4i . The front still maintains a 5.5″ size screen but this time it pushes a Full HD display (1920×1080) with thinner bezels. The Redmi Note 2 is thinner too at 8.05mm and it weighs 159 grams, according to its certified specs in the database. As comparison, the original Redmi Note is thicker at 9.5mm and it weighs close to 200 grams. The Redmi Note 2 is spotted with 2 variants, one with  TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE , and another with more bands including  WCDMA and FDD-LTE . Under the hood, they didn’t mention the type of processor but it is listed to be a 2GHz Octa-Core unit (likely MediaTek) that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. On-board it has a larger 16GB of storage which can be expanded with microSD. For its cameras, the Redmi Note 2 is listed to carry a 13MP main and a 5MP front unit, similar to the Mi 4i. From the back, the Redmi Note 2 maintains the same centre aligned placement for its camera and LED flash but this time it gets a circular lens design. The loud speaker has a longer grill placed at the bottom with a little stub that’s also similar to the Mi 4i. Like most new Xiaomi products, you can expect 4G LTE support on dual-SIM slots.  So far there’s no word on its availability yet, but who knows it might be announced alongside their  brand new product  this week.  [  SOURCE   2 ,  VIA  ]"

A couple of interesting things have been mentioned while there was a let down specifically on their fingerprint feature. When asked about its screen size, OnePlus had responded with a picture above where a OnePlus One unit is stacked over its upcoming OnePlus 2. Without going to specifics, either OnePlus has managed to trim its bezels or they could be opting for a slightly smaller screen size that would pack higher pixel density. What’s clear is that the 2 will be smaller, making it easier to hold than its current model that’s loosely based on the  OPPO Find 7 . In terms of battery, the OnePlus 2 will pack 10% more with a 3,300mAh capacity unit. This is almost a 10% increase from its current 3,100mAh unit on the OnePlus One. The camera is said to be improved with a couple of new things that will set it apart from others. For those who are still wondering, the OnePlus One will still continue to sell alongside the OnePlus 2 once it goes on sale.  With regards to its fingerprint feature, OnePlus had  earlier teased  that it will carry the most advanced fingerprint scanner in the market. With Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor on board, many would anticipate OnePlus to utilise its new Sense ID, which recognises your fingerprint in 3D instead of the usual optical scanner. Unfortunately OnePlus has confirmed that it will be using a physical fingerprint sensor, and not Qualcomm’s Sense ID. The launch is happening on 27th July (28th July 10AM Malaysia) and this is the first time a smart phone is being launched worldwide in Virtual Reality. If you don’t have the VR Box, don’t fret as OnePlus will be releasing their launch app which caters for both VR and non-VR users. Just to recap what we know so far, the OnePlus 2 will be powered by a Snapdragon 810 processor that’s clocked at a lower 1.8GHz speed and it will be mated to 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. It also gets a reversible USB Type C port and  pricing is said  to be between US$322-US$450 (about RM1,230-RM1,700).  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Powered by Oculus, the Gear VR that’s designed for the S6 is priced at RM799 and it will be available at Samsung Experience Stores located in KL, Selangor, Penang and Johor.  With a Galaxy S6/S6 edge plugged in, the Gear VR offers a new gaming experience with a variety of content offered from the Oclus Store. Apart from games, you can view 360 degree photos, videos and special experiences including performances by Cirque du Soleil. The Gear VR comes with an accelerator, gyro meter and proximity sensor built in and it connects to your S6/S6 edge via its microUSB port. If you’re wearing glasses, there’s an adjustable focus dial at the top but it only caters up to a certain degree.  Compared to the first generation Gear VR that was designed for the Note 4, this new version is 15% smaller which makes it more comfortable to wear. For a prolonged usage, there’s a micro USB port at the bottom which allows you to power and charge both Gear VR and your S6 continuously. To prevent fogging on the lens, there’s even an integrated cooling fan on the unit.  The Gear VR only comes in white and it is adjustable with its elastic strap. On the right side, there’s a touchpad with a little stub in the middle to mark its centre point. To navigate around, you can touch on the pad and you can make a selection by tapping on the centre. There’s a dedicated back button at the top to return to home at anytime. By default, the sound comes from the external loud speakers of the S6 but you can hook up a pair of headphones for a better experience. You can use the Gear VR on its own but we reckon it is best enjoyed with a wireless game pad. Want to experience the Gear VR yourself? You can check it out at the main entrance of Pavilion KL from today, 10th July until 12th July, between 12PM to 9PM. You can also stand a chance to win free movie tickets by taking a shot at their Gear VR challenges. Samsung will also bring the Gear VR experience to Sunway Pyramid at the Blue Zone on 25th-26th July.  For more info, you can check out the  Gear VR Innovator Edition for S6  product page."

The company will now be producing only three types of devices, flagships, business and value phones, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. If this is true, its likely that we will only be seeing six new Lumia models per year, with two new ones per each of the aforementioned categories. This year Microsoft had already launched six smartphones, the Lumia 435,  Lumia 532 , L umia 640, Lumia 640 XL, Lumia 430  and the  Lumia 540  Dual, but the new strategy is likely to only launch next year so we are probably going to see more launches to come. Also,  Windows 10 Mobile  is just around the corner, set for a September launch so they’re likely to push out some new phones along with it at the very least. This phone is rumoured to be the Lumia 940 but there’s no concrete evidence for now. But the question remains, does this mean Microsoft is moving away from hardware to focus more on software as it traditionally has? [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

The original details for the launch and price were spotted on  suning,  but the details on the page seems to have since disappeared. Regardless, the Galaxy A8 is set to make its official entry into the Chinese market on the 17th July, with a €439 (about RM 1840) price tag. As for the specs, the phone has an octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor mated to 2GB RAM under the hood, alongside 16GB expandable storage up to 128GB via micro SD card. It will also have a 5.7 inch Super AMOLED display at 1080p, powered by a 3,050mAh battery. The camera combo here would be a 16 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front snapper, which is squeezed into the phone’s tiny 5.94mm frame by using a thinner ISOCELL sensor. The rear camera will have an aperture of f/1.9 and real-time HDR like the  Samsung Galaxy S6 . You will also find a fingerprint sensor embedded in its home button like the Galaxy S6 as well.

Always wanted to own the latest  iPhone 6  but its  high price  is holding you back? Here’s an easier way switch from your current device with the Maxis iPhone Trade-Up Program. From now until 31st July, you can trade up from any smart phone and enjoy extra savings when you sign up with Maxis. According to them, they will accept any device even though it’s not functioning anymore, as long as there are no signs of bloated battery, and if it’s an iPhone, it has to be unlocked. All models will be accepted from the old non-touch enabled feature phones to the new mainstream models. If you lost the box and original charger, no worries as Maxis requires just the phone for this programme. Just make sure it is in good condition with a stylus included (if it originally comes with one).  So much does your old phone cost? Let’s find out. We got a bunch of old phones and we visited our local phone shops to get an estimate of its trade-in values. Our collection includes a Galaxy S4 (with a cracked screen), Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note 3, HTC One M7, Nokia N8, Nokia E5, Nokia X3 feature phone and a BlackBerry Torch that’s missing its battery. Then we went to the Maxis Centre at KLCC to find out if they accept them all and how much each of them are worth. When we asked around the phone shops at shopping malls, most of them wouldn’t pay more than RM100 for old feature phones or outdated smart phones. You might get a similar or better deal for newer models as some of them are willing to accept the Note 3 for RM600 and the Galaxy S5 for RM700. Obviously you can probably get a higher price if you can get a direct buyer. For anything else, Maxis trade-up evaluation is on-par if not better than the normal dealers.  Cracks & Damages? No Problems Some of you may have a beaten up device that’s still functional like our Galaxy S4. Even if the display is cracked or heavily scratched, Maxis is still accepting it for a minimum value of RM200, or RM300 if you’re a new subscriber (inclusive of new/port-in RM100 promo). Mind you that the extra RM100 for new subscribers will come as a monthly rebate of RM50 for 2 months, which is reflected in your bill.  If the device is non-functional, Maxis is still accepting it but with a minimum value of RM200. Take note however phones with bloated batteries will not be accepted for safety purposes and if you’re trading in an iPhone, it needs to be unlocked beforehand.   iPhone 6 & iPhone 6 Plus Contract Plans 
 After handing over your old device, you’ll need to pick your desired iPhone model and a postpaid plan with 24 months contract. For a worry free experience, you can opt for its limitless talk and SMS bundled Maxis OnePlan (2GB internet inclusive) with 1GB of extra internet at RM158/month. For those wishing to commit less, there’s the iValue postpaid plans that start from just RM100/month. During sign up, the trade-in amount will be used to offset the price of the new device. So if we trade-up the Galaxy S5 with Maxis as a new subscriber, we can get RM900 off (RM800 + RM100) from its bundled pricing. This means we could get the iPhone 6 16GB effectively for Free on iValue 3, or RM639 (before GST) on their MaxisOne Plan. Meanwhile if you’re using an iPhone 5 (valued at RM600), you could potentially pick up the iPhone 6 from as low as RM109 (before GST) on iValue 3 contract with Maxis as a new subscriber.   With its RM200 minimum trade-up guarantee and an extra RM100 off for new subscribers, it’s also a good opportunity to dispose that old dusty feature phone of yours. For existing Maxis subscribers with good payment records, they will waive the advance payment that’s usually required upfront when you sign on a contract.  The  Maxis iPhone Trade Up  program aims to be your one stop centre to make the iPhone 6 switch without the hassle of disposing your current phone the old fashion way. The whole process is seamless and you can walk in with your old phone and out with a brand new iPhone 6 in one single visit. With the extra savings, it is more worthwhile than to buy the iPhone 6 outright which costs at least RM2,702 with GST. To get started, just visit any Maxis Centre or Maxis Exclusive Partner nationwide with your current phone.  For more info, visit the  Maxis iPhone Trade Up  page."

The device is reported to be launching in China July 17th. Considering the current model, the  Samsung Galaxy A7  is priced at RM 1,499, this is a rather big leap upwards in terms of pricing but the Galaxy A8 does have slightly better specs than its predecessor on top of being slightly larger. It’s also a lot thinner, coming in at 5.9mm as opposed to the Galaxy A7’s 6.3mm thickness.

The R7 Plus will also be running ColorOS 2.1 based on Android 5.1 out of the box. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP Sony IMX278 camera that’s capable of shooting Ultra HD pictures up to 52MP resolution. For natural illumination, it is supported with dual-tone LED flash. Selfie shots are taken with its 8MP front shooter which comes with auto beautification features. Additionally, the R7 Plus will feature an extra fingerprint scanner at the back that allows you to unlock the phone at a touch. You can view the R7 Plus product page over  here . The OPPO R7 lite on the other hand features the same design and 2.5D glass as as the R7 and R7 Plus and will generally have the same specs as its bigger brother albeit with a few differences. The R7 lite will have the same processor and camera combo as the R7 Plus as well as ColourOS 2.1 based on Android 5.1. The unit will have slightly less memory and storage, at 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage that’s expandable to 128GB via a microSD card. It will also be a dual SIM LTE device like its sibling but will instead play host to a MicroSIM and NanoSIM combo instead of having both slots supporting only NanoSIM. The display will be a 5.0 inch HD AMOLED screen. Battery wise it also is of a lower capacity of 2,320mAh with Fast Charge but given its much slimmer frame of 6.3mm thin, that was probably all they could fit in. The OPPO R7 Plus will retail for RM 1,998 while the R7 lite will be selling for RM 1,298. The R7 Plus will be available in Malaysia starting July 11th for pre-order, with the sales to come early August. Meanwhile the R7 Lite will be made available at a later date.

Expected to be a new flagship killer for 2015, the OnePlus 2 is now confirmed to be carrying a 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM which puts it on par with the likes of Xiaomi’s  Mi Note Pro .   To recap what OnePlus have revealed so far, the new model will be running on Qualcomm’s  Snapdragon 810  processor but it will be  clocked lower  at 1.8GHz instead of 2.0GHz for better thermal efficiency. This is expected to help to optimise stability and hopefully it would result longer battery life in the long run. In addition, the OnePlus 2 will be sporting a  USB Type C  reversible charging port which is a new standard that has been adopted on the new MacBook and Nokia N1 tablet. For greater security, OnePlus is including what they claim to be the most  advanced fingerprint sensor  and it is likely to be Qualcomm’s new Sense ID which would work even with contaminated fingertips.  In terms of price, the OnePlus will be priced higher than its current OnePlus One. All we know is it will be  priced between  US$322 to US$450 which is around RM1,227 to RM1,716 with our current exchange rates. With the improved specs and features, the OnePlus 2 is still priced lower than Xiaomi’s Mi Note Pro (64GB) which currently carries a price tag of 2,999 CNY (about RM1,843). The OnePlus 2 will be  launched  on 27th July (28th July 10AM Malaysian Time) and you can view it yourself in VR.  [  SOURCE  ]"

Most of the time, when we pop up Tinder we are using our brains (and eyes, mostly) to pick a potential date, but this app concept from T3 uses your  Apple Watch  ‘s pulse sensor to deduce whether or not to swipe left or right. Video after the break. How this works is the app shows you pictures and profiles as usual but uses the Apple Watch SDK to make use of the pulse sensor to detect even minor heart rate elevations. In a nutshell, the app decides whether to swipe left or right based on how “excited” your heart gets when presented with a potential candidate. Granted working just based on your basal reactions to pictures of pretty people doesn’t entirely sound like it might work, but its a pretty novel concept on its own. The app is still in the concept phase for now, but you can check out the video below to get a peek at how it could work. So do you think this would make a good app for the Apple Watch? [ SOURCE ]"

The countries already set to have a price increase are Mexico, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey, with South Korea’s price hike due to a 10% value-added (VAT) tax which is now included in the price of apps. Developers in that country would have to handle the tax on their own while Apple will collect and pay the tax for developers based outside of the country. As for the rest, it has to do with exchange rates. Users in those countries who have auto-renewable subscriptions will have to resubscribe to follow the new pricings, but they will be notified by Apple and given the option to re-enable or opt out. Mexican users on the other hand will not have interruptions to their services but will be given the same options. On the other hand, Apple is making two new low-price tiers available for India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Turkey called Alternate Tier A and Alternate Tier B, which has already been active in the Chinese market. But it seems a bit weird that Mexico, South Africa and Turkey are getting a price increase but are also subject to the two new low-price tiers, so what exactly is Apple going to be doing for these three countries? As for us, we don’t know yet if we will be affected by the fluctuations (our currency is taking a divebomb after all) so will we see higher or lower prices for the Malaysia market? What do you think?

If you’re looking for something cheaper without much compromise, the  HTC One ME  might be your cup of tea. Announced for the  Chinese market , the One ME is now available in Malaysia via DirectD and this is a grey import unit which comes with 2 years in-house warranty. You get pretty much the same goods as the One M9+ but at RM700 less. This is similar story as the  HTC One M8  and its cheaper  HTC One E8  sibling.

On the exterior, it is identical but it is slightly thicker at 9.75mm and lighter at 155 grams. This is due to its polycarbonate back but it still uses a metal frame around the sides for a subtle touch of premium.  Over at the front, you still get its stereo BoomSound speakers, a fingerprint sensor and a 4MP Ultrapixel front camera. Meanwhile at the back, it gets a 20MP main camera with dual-LED flash like its One M9, which is a single unit without the extra Duo Camera set up. Powering the device is still the same 2,840mAh capacity battery which is also non-removable. The One ME is a dual-SIM device using Nano-SIM and it also supports 4G LTE including our local Band 3/7.

Coming in at $399 (about RM 1521) this tiny cube-shaped shooter measures just 1.5 inches long, is waterproof up to 10 meters and is capable of shooting 1440p video at 30fps. GoPro has done a lot in slimming down their cameras with the Session being the most unobtrusive model they have. It lacks some of the hardware that its bigger brother the  GoPro Hero 4  has, but apparently doesn’t slack in terms of capability. In a sense, the device is in the same vein as the  HTC RE  and the  Yi Action Camera  which also run on the same single button style of operation. The two are also a lot more affordable than the Session, with them being priced at RM 669 (from  DirectD )and RM 429 respectively. While the Session does come with a strap, the HTC RE is probably easier to hold on to as it has a more ergonomic shape, albeit one shaped like a plastic tube. However, if you want to change any of the settings on the camera you have to use included Wi-Fi remote (which is sold seperately) or go through the GoPro’s mobile app. It does have an absolutely tiny screen at the top of it but this is mainly to show you your battery level and active settings. You will still have to rely on an external device to view your videos and images. The Session also has two mics, one at the front and one at the rear that switch dynamically to reduce wind noise. For storage, the Session can handle any microSD card with a class 10 or UHS-1 rating up to a capacity of 64GB. How much you will be able to cram into it though, depends a lot on your recording resolution. There are some drawbacks to its compact size, one being it is incapable of recording in 4K, takes stills in 8 megapixels only and cannot record video above 100fps. But these seem to be relatively small trade-offs for what you’re already getting in this compact form factor. Regardless, like all GoPro devices the Session will have access to a small mountain of mounting options and accessories to choose from, which makes it even more versatile. The GoPro Hero 4 Session is set to hit the market sometime next week, though we don’t know if it will be getting a Malaysian launch just yet.

Initially, images uploaded to Instagram were only being displayed at 640 x 640 resolution, which is markedly small by today’s standards. But starting last week it seems that images being uploaded are being saved in 1080p resolution, probably in the process of getting the platform ready for the switch. Instagram themselves originally denied that they are saving images at any higher than 640 x 640, but the program is undoubtedly saving and displaying images at a much higher resolution than before. They’ve now confirmed that they will gradually be rolling out the feature for iOS and Android, but the web version won’t be getting any love just yet. For now the only way to spot it at the moment is by delving into the image’s source code on Instagram web, where the first link with the .jpg suffix will tell you the image’s size via a browser like Chrome or Firefox. Checking the image out on mobile (as in, your phone’s Instagram folder) still displays the original resolution which it was snapped in, which in turn is reliant on your phone’s camera. We don’t quite know why they are limiting the new image size for the desktop version but this is already great news for Instagrammers as they won’t have their images as compressed as they used to be.

With an IP certification of IP X7, the watch can basically handle being submerged for up to 30 minutes in up to a metre deep of water with no issue but even then Apple doesn’t recommend wearing it to the pool. Developer Ted Bradley is the guy behind the app, having written a similar one for the Pebble and porting it over to the Apple Watch. Granted he had issues porting it over due to differences between the interfaces and the complexity of the OS. Like on the Pebble apps stay open till the user closes it while on the Watch the screen shuts off to save on power, causing the app to stop measuring real time data. However there are APIs in place that allow the Watch to recall data stored while the screen is off, so once the screen is back on you get the rest of the information, albeit with a bit of lag. The info can also be imported to HealthKit to measure the number of laps completed and distance covered, making use of the heart rate sensor as well. As well as the app works, Apple does not endorse apps that encourage users to use an Apple device in ways that could possibly damage it, hence why you will never find it on the App Store. Bradley and his team does hope that the next gen Apple Watch has better waterproofing so apps like his can really get the most out of the Watch. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

The styling looks very similar to that of the  Samsung Galaxy S6  but with a slot for the S-Pen and what is likely to be a non-removable battery. This is evidenced by slot on the side which is likely to be either a SIM or a microSD expansion slot but its too soon to tell. Video after the break. The battery capacity for the device is said to be 4,100mAh which the Note 5 should be able to accommodate without any issue, with the phone said to be about 10.2mm thick inclusive of the camera hump. The rumoured overall dimensions of the device are said to be 153.4 x 77.3 x 10.2mm; but doesn’t seem to have enough room to fir the 5.89 inch screen with 2mm bezels on either side. Also, the Note 5 looks like it will be coming with a standard microUSB instead of the rumoured USB Type-C port. To recap, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is rumoured to either have a Exynos 7430 processor or the Exynos 7422 under the hood that is Samsung’s first all-in-one solution with an integrated CPU, GPU, RAM, storage and modem in a single chip. It is also likely to have 3GB RAM, a 1440 x 2560 Super AMOLED display and a 13 megapixel and 8 megapixel camera combo.

soyacincau,OPPO R7 Plus and R7 Lite First Impressions,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/08/oppo-r7-plus-r7-lite-hands-on-malaysia/,"Android,Dual Sim,Hands-on,Oppo Malaysia,Oppo R7,oppo r7 lite,OPPO R7 Lite Hands-on,OPPO R7 Lite Malaysia,oppo R7 plus,OPPO R7 Plus Malaysia,OPPO R7 Series","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-07-08,"OPPO has  introduced   its  R7 series , its latest offering for the Malaysia market. Announced  earlier in May , OPPO Malaysia is bringing 2 models, the  R7 Plus  phablet and a more compact R7 Lite. For the Malaysian market, we won’t be getting the original R7 but instead we are getting the  R7 Lite  that offers lower specs and it carries a much lower price tag.  As other manufacturers have been pushing specs for their new flagship models, OPPO on the other hand decides to focus on premium design with slimness as their main highlight. Powering the devices is a mid-range Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s also found on the  Mi 4i ,  OPPO R1x  and  Galaxy A7 . The R7 series offers a unibody metal frame which is apparently inspired by the design of a violin. It is thin to hold but the R7 isn’t as thin as their once world record holder, the R5 which boast a ridiculously thin 4.85mm side profile.  The R7 Plus is a huge device with a 6″ Full HD AMOLED display but it manages to boast a high screen to body ratio with the use of on-screen buttons for the front. Overall it feels quite a well polished device with the use of 2.5D glass which makes the edge smoother to touch and it manages to keep its bulk in check with a 7.75mm thickness. With a 4,100mAh capacity battery, it feels heavier at 203 grams, but at least it’s lighter than the former 5.9″ OPPO N1 (213 grams). From a design perspective, it does  remind us  of the  Huawei Ascend Mate 7  which coincidentally also comes with a 6″ display, a rear mounted fingerprint scanner and a 4,100mAh capacity battery. In terms of specs, the Mate 7 may have a better processor but it loses out in the camera and fast charging department.  Under the hood, the R7 Plus gets a Snapdragon 615 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM with 32GB of on-board storage. You can expand up to 128GB extra via microSD card which would utilise its secondary SIM tray slot. Connectivity wise, the R7 Plus supports 4G LTE on both SIM slots as well as WiFi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0.  In the camera department, the main shooter uses Sony’s 13MP IMX278 camera sensor that’s similarly found on the Huawei P8. It boasts a quicker 0.1 second focus time with its Phase Detection AF and the sensor is a 4-colour RGBW unit. It is assisted with a dual-tone LED flash and there’s a laser auto focus light for guidance. Over at the front, there’s an 8MP camera with Beautify 3.0 selfie feature.   Out of the box, the R7 Plus is running on their latest iteration of ColorOS 2.1 which is based on Android 5.1 Lollipop. Finally OPPO has a smart phone that runs on a newer operating system as the past few models have been stuck with KitKat or an older version. According to OPPO, the new ColorOS has been improved for faster boot times, stability and smoothness. In our short playtime, it does feel quick and that’s to be expected with a fresh new device with 3GB RAM. Like its previous flagship offering, you can double tap to wake or launch apps from sleep by drawing gestures on the screen.  Also supported is VOOC Flash Charging which boast faster charging in a shorter time. During its media launch, we are told that the R7 Plus is still capable of doing 75% charge in just 30 minutes, and a 5 minutes charge is enough to sustain 2 hours of talk time which is quite remarkable. Priced at RM1,998, the R7 Plus is quite a high price to pay for a Snapdragon 615 powered device but it tries to make up for it by having a larger screen, bigger battery capacity and having a more premium build quality. The R7 Plus will be open for pre-orders on 11th July with official availability targeted for early August. UPDATE : We’ve been informed that the “OPPO R7 Lite” shown here is actually the original R7 that comes with a Full HD display and has 3GB of RAM. However the exterior design and dimensions are identical with the OPPO R7 Lite.  The next device is the R7 Lite which is priced at RM1,298. When we asked why is OPPO offering the R7 Lite instead of the full fledged R7 in Malaysia, we are told that this is to cater for a price sensitive segment since the R7 Lite is priced at RM700 lower than its top of the line R7 Plus. On the exterior, this is essentially the same R7 with a 5″ display but it is downgraded in terms of RAM with just 2GB (instead of 3GB) while the screen resolution pushes a standard HD 720p resolution instead of Full HD.  The build quality is similar with its R7 Plus with a metal unibody design as well as a smoothen-out 2.5D glass for the front. The R7 Lite feels more refined with more curves and polished frame, as opposed to its similar spec-ed R1x that has more sharp edges. On the front it gets 3 capacitive buttons which are not illuminated, while the back gets a clean metal back with its camera and LED flash being positioned at the top left corner. In terms of thickness, the R7 Lite is 6.3mm thin, which is the same as the Galaxy A7, Samsung’s thinnest smart phone at the moment.  The speaker like its bigger R7 Plus sibling is positioned at the back of the device, which we felt could better place on the bottom of the device. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP main camera while the front get a high resolution 8MP shooter. Being a “Lite” device, another omission is the lack of VOOC Flash Charge but it still claims to have a Fast Charger without mentioning its actual charge rate.  Under the hood, it gets 2GB RAM, 16GB of storage and it also supports dual-SIM with 4G LTE. If you need to expand more storage, the 2nd slim slot also doubles up as a microSD expansion. During the launch, the R7 Lite is still running on KitKat but we’re told that it will be running on the latest ColorOS 2.1 with Android 5.1 by the time it goes on sale. It’s a nice device but it is quite hard to recommend this over higher spec smart phones within the same price range like the highest spec ASUS ZenFone 2, OnePlus One or Honor 6.

The  Galaxy S6  and  Galaxy S6 edge  finally gets a newer metal and glass design which is a departure from its old plasticky build. If spending RM3,599 for the  64GB version  of the Galaxy S6 edge isn’t enough, the limited edition  Galaxy S6 edge in Iron Man  colours can now be bought in Malaysia. You’ve probably seen the iPhone 6 Plus being sold at over RM7,000 by scalpers. Get ready, as the asking price for the S6 edge Iron Man edition will surprise you. The Galaxy S6 edge Iron Man edition is sold only in selected markets such as China and South Korea. As usual, the folks at DirectD can let you own one of these rare units but only if you’re willing to pay the price. In South Korea with 1,000 units to go around, the Iron Man themed device is priced at 1.19 million Won which is slightly more than RM4,000. If you’re dying to buy one, DirectD can make it happen for RM10,999, with GST included of course. You get the Galaxy S6 edge in a nice exclusive box and it comes with a wireless charger with Iron Man’s core reactor design on top. As for the device, the Galaxy S6 edge gets a stunning red colour body surrounded by a gold colour frame. Everything else in the phone is the same, and it also comes with 64GB of non-expandable storage on-board. For some, RM10,999 could be a bargain considering a unit was  auctioned off  for about RM340,000 in China and that’s because of a double digit serial number 66. After all, this is a country with a growing wealthy population which a guy can afford to buy not one, but  two Apple Watch editions for his dog . If you’re interested and money is no object to you, head over to  DirectD  to pre-order yours. Sorry, JARVIS isn’t included."

The company is in fact planning to launch at least  two new Android devices  this year, one codenamed the BlackBerry Venice and the BlackBerry Prague. The Venice is set to be a high end slider while the Prague is expected to look more like the lower-end  BlackBerry Z3 . However this render posted by @evleaks doesn’t look like either one and actually resembles the  BlackBerry Passport  a lot more. If it does end up being like the Passport, the device is likely to be pretty big with flagship features and a high price to boot. Buttons on the display also indicates that the BlackBerry is running on Android Lollipop, but that’s all we can tell just from the render alone, with little more information available on the device. However, something is a bit off with the render because the “Enter” key is on the digital keyboard is redundant since there is one on the physical QWERTY keyboard. Also since the device was rumoured to be a slider,the keys jutting out doesn’t make any sense as it will get in the way when you slide it back in on top of it looking like the Passport.  So like any rumour, take this with a pinch of salt.

You’re not alone. The update generally made it a struggle for iOS 8.4 users to use turn-by-turn navigation and other functions of navigation software like Apple Maps, Google Maps and Waze. But do not fret, we have some solutions to help you tackle the problem. There are three ways you can attempt to fix the GPS issue, either by resetting your network settings, turning location services on or off and even backup and restore fresh using iTunes. To reset your network settings, head on over to the Settings app and then head over to General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will reset all your network settings and wipe your WiFi password but it will help fix the problem. Another alternative is turning the location services of and off. It’s slightly trickier than the above solution but its well worth it. First head on over to your Location Services in your settings in this order Settings > Privacy  > Location Services, and turn the switch off. Next restart your iPhone and turn the switch back on and the problem should be rectified. The last one is the hardest to do and should be used as a last resort should all else fail. Make sure you have backed up everything using iTunes or iCloud before you do this, and restore fresh to iOS 8.4 using iTunes. It’s a long process but there is a chance it might fix the GPS issue. You can grab the  iOS 8.4 update  here. The last alternative however, if you couldn’t fix it using any of the methods above is to wait for Apple to release a fix themselves, though it does mean you won’t be able to get around too much if you’re the sort that gets lost a lot.

It is no surprise that they could sell 2.8 million units especially when it has a low RM59 price tag and an impressive month-long battery life. Now a newer version is in the works and Xiaomi appears to be upping its game with the inclusion of a heart rate sensor. An unconfirmed source claims that the new Mi Band was spotted in Taiwan’s NCC certification body as the Mi Band 1S. From the purported leaked photo, it shows a similar design but it gets an extra sensor underneath. In terms of wearable devices,  Fitbit  is still number 1 with over 3.9 million units sold, taking about 34% market share. In comparison with other wearables, Fitbit is solely focused on fitness and they currently have  official presence  in Malaysia. Its Charge HR (RM510) and Surge (RM968) wearables offer continuous heart rate monitoring and they last 7 days on a single charge. This is quite remarkable considering other smart watches only offer heart rate reading on demand or at specific time intervals.  Obviously the new Mi Band 1S with a heart rate sensor would take a hit in battery life. But who knows if they can tweak to to last more than 7 days and if they priced this correctly, Xiaomi might have a chance to overtake Fitbit by end of this year. The main difference of course is the platform and fitness community which Fitbit has established firmly. Xiaomi isn’t on par yet but if it is cheap, there’s nothing much to complain if it just works.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

In terms of styling it is going to share the same design aesthetic as its flagship sibling the  LG G4 ,  but this is mostly where the similarities end. The device is rumoured to have an octa-core processor clocking 1.5GHz (which is likely to be a Snapdragon 615) an 8 megapixel camera with laser autofocus. The display will be a 5.2 inch 1080p screen that is similar to what the  LG G2  has.

One of their recent sales milestone was their  Mi Fan Festival  which saw 2.12 million smart phones being sold in just 12 hours. 70% of Xiaomi’s smart phone sales came directly from their Mi.com online store, which signifies the importance of selling directly to customers.

Sirap Bandung,Is Samsung embedding spy chips in your phone? Probably not.,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/07/02/is-samsung-embedding-spy-chips-in-your-phone-probably-not/,,,2015-07-02,"We’ve all heard it at least once, the government just loves to spy on people by putting additional chips in your phone to monitor your every move. Every little thing out of place could be home to that very chip that they’re tracking all your calls with, waiting for the right bit of juicy information to use as an excuse to whisk you off, never to be seen again. Smartphones are pretty complicated as they are, and if you open yours you are likely to find a lot of things you don’t understand within. In particular, Samsung batteries have attracted attention recently for “hiding” spy chips within, leading people to actually peel them open to remove the little coil inside.    (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); The truth is that’s just an NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna. People outside the tech bubble probably don’t even know what NFC is, and videos circulating about people removing the receiver has sparked a fair bit of paranoia. As the claim goes, the chip is supposedly communicating wirelessly with other sources and is leaking your data and photos without your knowledge. While the wireless communication bit is true (that’s what NFC is designed to do) but trust us, the government probably doesn’t want to see what you’ve been doing on Facebook all day. Plus you’ll need another device to physically touch the NFC panel in order for information to be exchanged.    (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/all.js#xfbml=1""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); The myth was likely originally perpetuated by  this guy ; who has been repeatedly  copied  by many people, including a  Malaysian who recently claimed  that Samsung was spying on him with the said mysterious chip. Most Samsung smart phones from the Galaxy S III has an NFC antenna embedded with the battery. This would then allows you to beam files with another NFC enabled device directly from the back of the smart phone. If you’re not convinced yet, this Samsung battery spying myth has been  debunked by Snopes . At any rate, it is extremely ill advised to attempt opening up anything on your phone, especially  the battery . Please don’t try this for yourself and leave your tinfoil hats at home.

soyacincau,Honor 7 is now official. Goes upmarket with a fingerprint scanner and greater voice controls,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/30/huawei-honor-7-now-official/,"Honor,Honor 7,Honor 7 official,Honor 7 Specs,Honor Malaysia,huawei,Huawei Honor,Huawei Honor 7,Huawei Honor 7 Launch","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-06-30,"Huawei has finally announced its new  Honor 7 , which will replace its current  Honor 6  smart phone. The Honor 6 is one of our favourite 5″ flagship devices which is now going for RM899. The Honor brand is supposedly Huawei’s answer to the growing demand of high spec smart phones with a more affordable price tag.  With the new Honor 7, it looks like the aggressive sub-brand is taking a more premium step. Like its predecessor, the Honor 7 appears to be better than the current  Huawei P8  flagship and it even shares some similarities with its larger  Ascend Mate 7  phablet. For starters, the Honor 7 gets an aluminium alloy shell for both front and back which not only gives it better durability but it also helps to improve thermal efficiency. The front gets a slightly larger 5.2″ Full HD display, which is similar to its current Huawei P8. Powering the device is their top of the line Kirin 935 64-bit Octa-Core processor which utilises 4x A53 Cores @ 2.2GHz + 4x A53 Cores @ 1.5GHz. This is mated to 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM and depending on variant, you get either 16GB or 64GB of on-board storage. The Honor 7 is also a dual-SIM 4G LTE device and the secondary SIM slot also accepts microSD expansion up to 128GB.  Camera is quite a big deal for the Honor 7. The back gets a 20MP f/2.0  Sony IMX230  Exmor RS sensor which comes with fast Phase Detection Auto Focus. Meanwhile the front gets a 8MP f/2.4 selfie camera with 1.4micron pixel size, a 26mm wide angle lens and a soft flash for better illumination. Like most Chinese smart phones, it gets their latest version of their auto beautification feature. Powering the Honor 7 is a similar capacity 3,100mAh battery as the predecessor but now it supports quick charge that does 50% in just 30 minutes. Also included at the back is a new generation one touch fingerprint scanner which claims to unlock in just 0.5 seconds.   Another major highlight is the Honor 7’s voice controls which you can get it to launch apps or play music without waking your device physically, similar to the  Moto X . On the left side, there’s a dedicated button which calls up “ZhiLing”, supposedly Honor’s answer to the likes of Siri and Google Now. For now, it looks like this is applicable for the Chinese market and we’re not too sure if this will be rolled out for our region. Overall, the Honor 7 is 8.5mm thick and weighs 157 grams, which is heavier and thicker than the current Honor 6 at 7.5mm and 130 grams. According to  GizChina , the Honor 7 with 16GB storage starts from 1,999 CNY (about RM1,217) and it goes all the way up to 2,499 CNY (about RM1,521) for the 64GB version. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with EMUI 3.1.  For more info, visit Honor 7’s  product page ."

Its quite similar to the  Samsung Galaxy S6 edge  in a sense but with some differences in terms of screen size and processor under the hood. The phone is expected to have either a 5.4 inch or 5.7 inch Super AMOLED curved display with edges on both sides. It is also rumoured to have a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 processor, 32GB internal storage as well as a 16 megapixel rear camera capable of 4K video recording and Optical Image Stabilization. The front camera will be a more standard 5 megapixel snapper. In terms of physical dimensions, the device will be coming in at 151mm tall and about 73mm wide; which puts it a 9mm taller and 3mm wider than the Galaxy S6 edge. This is definitely pointing towards a larger display than 5.1 inches and a larger screen will in turn need a larger battery to power it so it does make sense. Project Zero 2 is said to be home to a 3,000 mAh battery as well. Its currently up in the air in terms of what the smartphone will be named, but it has been labeled as the Galaxy S6 Plus or Galaxy S6 edge Plus. The device is expected to be launched in the coming weeks so we are expecting quite a big reveal from Samsung. [ SOURCE ]"

Replacing the previous Meizu MX4 that came with an odd 5.36″ 1920×1152 pixel resolution IPS display, the Meizu MX5 gets a larger 5.5″ AMOLED screen that does a more conventional Full HD resolution of 1920×1080. The front looks similar with its  MX4 Pro  as it gets a home button that doubles up as a one-touch fingerprint scanner. The MX5 now comes with a metal unibody design which is more sturdy compared to the current MX4 that has a removable plastic back cover. Despite having more metal, the MX5 is only slightly heavier at 149g (MX4: 147g) and it manages to trim its thickness down to just 7.6mm (MX4: 8.9mm). Under the hood, it gets a MediaTek Helio X10 2.2GHz Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM, similar to the HTC One M9+. With the absence of a removable back cover, the sides feature a flush tray slot that holds two SIM cards with both supporting 4G LTE. Like its predecessor, there’s no microSD expansion slot available. Keeping its lights on is a 3,150mAh capacity battery and it supports fast charging as well. Meizu claims that the MX5 can be juiced up to 25% in 10 minutes and up to 60% in 40 minutes. The main camera appears to be unchanged from its predecessor with a 20.7MP f/2.2 main camera with twin LED lights but this time it is improved with a 6 element lens and a new laser auto focus element that’s similar to the LG G3. This allows the MX5 to focus quicker at a claimed 0.2 seconds. For better selfies, the front gets a 5MP f/2.0 camera that’s enhanced with smart selfie features. Out of the box, it runs on Flyme 4.5 which is a heavily skinned UI based on Android which is radically different from other devices. The Meizu MX5 comes in 3 storage capacities with the base 16GB model priced at 1,799 CNY (about RM1,093).

We’ve seen  Celcom ,  Digi  and most recently  U Mobile  engaged in a price war where you can get a postpaid plan with 3GB of data for less than RM40/month. Meanwhile over at Maxis, the most affordable option is their SurfMore 50 plan which comes with 2GB of data at RM50/month. To sweeten the deal, they are now doubling its data quota from 2GB to 4GB for 6 months. This is applicable for new subscribers that signed up from 25th June until 31st July 2015, and they are extending this to their current subscribers as well. If you’re currently on SurfMore 50, you should have received an SMS about this offer and they will allocate the extra data within 7 days. While this is a good move, Maxis should really consider making its data plans more affordable. After the  introduction  of its MaxisOne plan, they have discontinued its  SurfMore 75  plan (5GB for RM75) and topping up extra data is rather costly at RM35/GB on SurfMore or RM30/GB on MaxisOne Plan.  Then of course, there’s a concern of network quality which Maxis claims to have the  best 4G network  in the countries. While telcos can start throwing prices for their postpaid plans, the real challenge is whether they can maintain their network quality and bandwidth. Recently they have invested over RM1 billion to upgrade their network and from the looks of it, we don’t expect them to play the cheap data game anytime soon.

The  Galaxy A  series will be getting a new model soon in the form of the  Galaxy A8 . While the new number represents a bigger screen, the new Galaxy A8 also gets a fresher design inspired by its current  Galaxy S6  flagship. Normally you would expect some leakster or informant to drop more photos before its official announcement but this time the Galaxy A8 gets a full hands-on video by TENNA. That’s right, the official certification body for China has given the Galaxy A8 a full reveal in a hands-on video.  From what we can see, the Galaxy A8 shares a lot of similarities in design as the S6 especially at the front and its metal frames around the sides. The back however gets a similar matte surface like its other A series siblings. As expected, the display is a larger 5.7″ Super AMOLED unit that pushes a full HD resolution of 1920×1080 and underneath it gets an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage, similar to its Galaxy A7 brother. In terms of camera, it gets a 16MP shooter at the rear which is a bump from the standard 13MP camera on the current A5 and A7, while the front maintains a similar 5MP selfie cam. With a bigger screen, the Galaxy A8 gets a 3,050mAh capacity battery, which is appropriate for a device at this size. Dimension wise, the Galaxy A8 boast a rather thin 5.94mm side profile, making this the thinnest smart phone Samsung has produced since the Galaxy A7 (6.3mm). Looks like we’ve seen enough and we just need to wait for Samsung to announce its official availability.  [  SOURCE  ]"

However there will likely be a myriad of hardware tweaks to better the device as well as more colour options to let it match with the  Apple Watch . Also, it appears that the iPhone 6S won’t in fact have a dual-lens camera system as the chassis doesn’t show the appropriate openings for it. As such the flash and camera layout will likely be the same s the iPhone 6. The layout of the speaker and the ports will also be unchanged.

Sporting what looks like the same textured back as what we saw in the previous leaks, the device is expected to have a Snapdragon 410 processor mated to 1GB RAM, 8GB storage and LTE support. The budget smartphone will also be home to a 5 inch 1280 x 720 display as well as a 13 megapixel rear snapper and 5 megapixel front facing camera. Weirdly enough it really doesn’t seem to be too different internally from the  previous gen Moto G  with the exception of the camera and the processor. There hasn’t yet been official word of when it will hit the market but if they follow last years release schedule, it might come around sometime this September. [ SOURCE ]"

Looks like DirectD is now stocking the credit card sized  ASUS Zenpower 9600  mAh battery packs for RM59 inclusive of GST. We originally spotted  the battery packs in Jakarta  during the  ASUS Zenfone 2  launch a few months back, with the device sporting a larger 10000 mAh capacity but has since been made official to be a bit smaller than originally anticipated, as we won’t be getting that version locally. Moreover, the official pricing for the device was announced by  ASUS to be RM 69 , which is actually slightly more expensive than what DirectD is currently offering. The ZenPower has the advantage of being lighter than most power banks (at only 215g) and it pushes a higher 2.4Amp which charges faster than the typical 2.1Amp output shared by other battery packs. Three colours of Zenpower are currently available, namely silver, blue and gold, and you can  snag one for yourself here . No word if we will be getting the black and pink colour variants but DirectD will likely bring them in eventually. Thanks for the tip  @KevinNgTK!"

Sirap Bandung,This strap adds 30 more hours to your Apple Watch,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/29/this-strap-adds-30-more-hours-to-your-apple-watch/,"apple,Apple Watch,apple watch accessories,reservestrap,SmartWatch,watch,wearable","Apple,Mobile Accessories,Mobile Devices,Smart Watch",2015-06-29,"The  Apple Watch  is known for needing a daily nighttime juicing as the battery can only last a maximum of 18 hours at a go. There are already third party accessories that are coming out for the Watch but very few actually claim to be able to bump up your battery life, and the Reserve Strap is looking like the most legit one so far. The Reserve Strap essentially is a battery in the form of a well, strap that extends the life of the  Apple Watch  to about 30 hours. That roughly equates to 167% more battery life which in turn means you have to spend a lot less time stuck to a plugpoint to keep everything up and running. All you need to do is press the button on the strap to start charging the Watch when you feel the Watch could use a pick me up or you could leave it on to keep juicing to keep it at 100% battery till the Strap starts to wind down. This means you can get roughly 48 hours of use before you need to recharge them both. The Strap is designed to fit most wrist sizes and is water resistant, with compatibility with both 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch sizes. It will be available for purchase in three colours, white, grey and black, as pictured below. However none of this comes cheap as the  Reserve Strap is retailing for $ 249.99  (about RM 945) which is pretty killer for a strap, but at the moment its a bit hard to say just how effective the strap might be without real world testing. The first shipment of the Reserve Strap is set to head out into the world on November 3rd 2015. We are also giving away an Apple Watch so head on over to our  Facebook page  to find out how to snag it for yourself."

With its Exynos 7420 Octa-Core 64-bit processor that’s based on a 14nm process, it whoops Qualcomm which is struggling to douse the flames of its Snapdragon 810 overheating issues. Now its upcoming Snapdragon 820 is set to fix all that and its early benchmark results reveals some optimistic numbers. According to a South Korean source, a Snapdragon 820 device was spotted temporarily on GeekBench database which has been taken down. They added that the processor carrying the model number MSM8996 had scored 1732 in single-core and 4970 in muli-core tests. That’s quite a leap from its current Snapdragon 810 processor which scores 1227 in single-core and 4424 in multi-core Geekbench tests. What’s fascinating is that it beats the Galaxy S6’s Exynos 7420 processor in single-core by 246 points but it falls behind by 300 points in multi-core test. Since this a preliminary benchmark, we reckon the Snapdragon 820 would perform better when it is released commercially. Things are looking optimistic but we would need to wait until early 2016. By then, Samsung would have a newer Exynos processor for its next Galaxy S device. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

This is currently the sharpest image we’ve got of the upcoming smartphone, complete with what looks like a ruggedised an outer casing. The renders however still don’t reveal all that much besides the S-Pen compartment and the speakers being located at the bottom of the phone instead of the rear like what they did with the  Samsung Galaxy S6  and  S6 edge . The camera also appears to be protruding at the back which is quite common among Samsung’s more current devices. If they are following the same design philosophy as they have with the S6 and S6 edge the Note 5 would likely have a glass back as well. To recap, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is rumoured to either have a Exynos 7430 processor or the Exynos 7422 under the hood that is Samsung’s first all-in-one solution with an integrated CPU, GPU, RAM, storage and modem in a single chip. It is also likely to have 3GB RAM, a 1440 x 2560 Super AMOLED display and a 13 megapixel and 8 megapixel camera combo. It also also rumoured to have a 3,220 mAh battery and would possibly be running Android Lollipop out of the box. There’s still a fair bit of time to go between the launch so there’s still a chance that any of this might change so we suggest taking this with a pinch of salt. But there’s surely more to come as IFA2015 draws closer. [ VIA ,  1 ][ SOURCE ]"

Now they have dropped more hints and the OnePlus 2 claims to feature the world’s most advanced fingerprint scanner. According to OnePlus, they could have added a fingerprint scanner on their current One flagship but they believed that biometric security has to be done right. Most implementations they mentioned were just tacked on as a selling point instead of being useful to the user. For the upcoming 2, they will be using one of the latest and the most advanced fingerprint scanner, which they say is faster than Apple’s TouchID. They added that one quick tap leads you directly to your home screen and you can program up to a maximum of 5 fingers.  Several Android flagships like the Galaxy S6, HTC One M9/M9+ and Huawei Ascend Mate 7 have adopted single touch unlocking for its finger print sensors. Can OnePlus do any better? Qualcomm has introduced  Sense ID , which is a 3D fingerprint technology that works more accurately and reliably even with contaminated finger tips. At time of announcement, Qualcomm says that Sense ID will be introduced on the latest Snapdragon 810 and 425 processors, so there’s a possibility of this being implemented on the OnePlus 2.

Now there are rumours that the so called hero phone that’s targeted to launch later this year will be called as the HTC Aero. Twitter leaker @evleaks is the one who chimed in with the smartphone’s coming launch. The new phone is expected to have a totally different direction compared to their upcoming 2016 flagships, which means the Aero will be filling in the void between the HTC One M9 and its successor. No indication of the specs yet but it should be rocking top end internals including a Quad HD display and maybe a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or MediaTek Helio X20 chipset under the hood. Q4 is still a long way to go and we probably get to see more leaks in the coming months.  [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

With a capacity of 200GB, the card can hold up to 20 hours of Full HD video or 1200 photos and is capable of 90MB/s transfer speeds. SanDisk has won multiple awards thanks to this card, and it’s apparently also water proof, shock proof, temperature, magnet and X-ray proof, if you happen to need to swap out your card while in an undersea volcano somewhere. It also comes backed with a 10 year warranty from SanDisk. And if you want one, you get it now from Amazon for a very reasonable price of US$239.44 excluding postage and handling, that’s about RM900 at today’s exchange rate.

Announced  officially last month , the X5Pro looks like Vivo’s answer to OPPO’s ultra-slim R series and both of them have very similar specs underneath. The X5Pro carries a retail price tag of RM1,599.  Design wise, it gets an iPhone-inspired unibody design with 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3 on both front and back, which is held together with a rounded stainless steel and aluminium frame. For an upmarket look, the X5Pro gets a Nano-crystal coating that gives a shimmering effect.  At the front, it gets a 5.2″ Super AMOLED display that pushes a Full HD resolution of 1920×1080 pixels. The display also comes with Smart Wake 2.0 which allows you to quick launch applications by drawing preset patterns on the screen while it is off. Powering the device is a 1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM and there’s 16GB of on-board storage which can be expandable. Like most Chinese smart phones, this is a dual-SIM 4G LTE device and if you need to add-on a microSD card, it will take up the 2nd SIM slot.  For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP f/2.0 camera that boast Phase-detection Autofocus. This is similar to the Galaxy S5’s  ISOCELL  camera and we reckon it is the same unit that’s on the  OPPO R7 .  Selfie duties are handled by its 8MP f/2.4 front camera that’s enhanced with Smart Beauty features built-in with the camera app. When taking selfies, it is able to recognise different genders and apply right the right make up levels accordingly. In China, the X5Pro comes with an  Iris scanner  but it won’t be available for our local market. In addition, Vivo is also banging on superior audio with its Cirrus Logic DAC AK4375 audio chip which claims to offers Hi-Fi quality sound. Overall the X5Pro is 6.4mm thin and it comes with a 2,450mAh capacity battery. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with its own custom FunTouch OS 2.1 skin on top. When compared to the  OPPO R7 , the X5Pro offers a slightly larger screen, larger battery capacity but it sacrifices on having just 2GB RAM (instead of 3GB). With regards to Vivo’s presence in Malaysia, they currently have over 2,000 point of sales outlets and 10 service centres nationwide. For more info, you can check out Vivo’s X5Pro  product page ."

The tech basically allows users to access functions based on the pressure they apply on the screen or trackpad. The phones are also said to have the same design as the iPhone 6, which is unsurprising given that Apple doesn’t seem interested in changing their design any time soon. Apple however did mention that the phone will have better and tougher aluminium for its chassis compared to the iPhone 6, which is likely to mitigate the Bendgate issue.

The mid-range smartphone is marketed towards music lovers mainly due to having a 1-watt speaker out back that apparently delivers a lot more kick than your average smartphone speaker. The device was just unveiled in South Korea and under the hood it features a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor mated to 2GB RAM and 16GB expendable memory. The camera combo you get here is a pretty standard one, with a 13 megapixel rear camera with laser auto focus as well as a 5 megapixel wide angle camera for the selfies with gesture shot support. It will also have a 5-inch display at 720 x 1280 resolution, 2,300mAh removable battery and run Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. As a bonus, buyers will also get a pair of LG QuadBeat 3 earphones with the unit. Of course it cannot hold a candle to its ultra premium cousin the  LG G4 , but it has decent enough specs to keep the average person happy. The LG Band Play will be retailing for 394,800 KRW (that’s about RM 1336) and will come in two flavours, black and white. So far there isn’t any word whether or not we might be getting the smartphone locally or if it will be a Korea exclusive. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

Despite having the newer V2.1 version which claims to have better thermal performance, there were number of users  complaining  that the Xperia Z3+ still does overheat. Just how bad is this issue? Watch the video after the break to find out. Running the camera apps can be taxing for the processor especially when trying to record 4K videos. However the Xperia Z3+ just struggles to run its AR Mask app beyond 30 seconds. After a couple of temperature warnings, it closes the camera app immediately. Sony Mobile is aware of the issue and a fix is said to be on the way. It looks like Qualcomm’s overheating woes with its flagship processor are far from over. Just recently, OnePlus had announced that its  2nd generation smart phone  will be using the same Snapdragon 810 processor, but it will be running at  lower 1.8GHz speeds  just to stay cool. Looks like Sony would need to put its Xperia Z3+ processor on a leash for a cooler experience.  [  SOURCE  ]"

Before this, the only way for people to get the device was through gray importers and other unofficial channels, which means consumers could be paying more for smartphones that don’t carry official warranties. That said, could it be possible that LG is gearing up for a local launch? To recap on the specs, the LG G4 gets a similar sized 5.5″ Quad HD display (2560×1440) as the previous model but it is enhanced with better brightness and contrast ratio with its Advanced In-Cell Touch technology. Under the hood, instead of a top of the line Snapdragon 810, it runs on a Hexa Core Snapdragon 808 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board there’s 32GB of on-board storage and you can also expand the storage with a microSD card. For taking pictures, the LG G4 claims to give the most manual controls with its 16MP f/1.8 rear caemra with Optical Image Stabilisation. For taking selfies, it features a higher resolution 8MP f/2.0 front camera. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery that supports fast charging, wireless charging (optional Quick Circle Case required) and it is removable too. Looking at all the flagships, this is probably the only new top-end device that offers both microSD and a removable battery. Out of the box it runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop with their proprietary UX 4.0 interface. You can read up more about the LG G4 in our  first impressions  or watch our  unboxing  of the device.

However the folks at DirectD are now offering imported units which comes in either single SIM or Dual-SIM variants.  The Xperia Z3+ is offered at RM2,599, which is the same price as the  Galaxy S6  and  HTC One M9+  flagships that are being sold officially in Malaysia. For the Xperia Z3+ Dual-SIM version, it is offered slightly higher at RM2,699. Since this isn’t an official Sony Malaysia set, DirectD is giving its own 2 year warranty. To recap, the Xperia Z3+ is the  international variant  of the Japan exclusive  Xperia Z4 . While the appearance looks the same as the current Xperia Z3, the Xperia Z3+ is actually thinner at 6.9mm (Z3: 7.3mm) and lighter at 144g (Z3: 152g). Another welcomed change is a cap-less microUSB port design, which makes it easier to charge without the need of removing flap covers. Like its previous models, it still maintains the highest waterproofing for a smart phone at IP68 rating. This allows it to be submerged under 1.5m of fresh water up to 30 minutes. The front still gets a 5.2″ Full HD (1920×1080) display and under the hood, it gets Qualcomm’s top of the line 2.0GHz octa-core Snapdragon 810 64-bit processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage there’s 32GB on-board which can be expanded using microSD card. As comparison, the current Z3 runs on a 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 processor and it gets just 16GB of storage.   For imaging, its main camera remains unchanged with a 20.7MP Exmor RS sensor with a 25mm f/2.0 lens. However the front camera has been upgraded with a 5MP shooter. In the battery department, the battery has shrunk from 3,100mAh on the Z3 to just 2,930mAh with the latest model, but Sony still claims to be able to provide up to 2 days of battery life per charge. With its quick charge feature, they reckon you can get a full day of use with just 45 minutes of charging. For more info, you can check out DirectD’s Sony Xperia Z3+  product page ."

From what we can tell so far the device will have a revamped back design on top of some small changes for the device in general. In terms of specs, the Moto G (2015) is expected to have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC mated to 1GB RAM and 8GB internal memory that’s expandable via a microSD slot. The screen on the other hand will be a 5 inch display with a 720p resolution. The camera has gotten quite a major upgrade, with a 13 megapixel rear snapper with dual-LED flash and a 5 megapixel front facing selfie shooter. As far as we can tell the Moto G (2015) pretty much is the same as the previous gen save for a better camera and a different processor but generally sports the same innards and screen. The device apparently is also booting Android 5.1.1 Lollipop so we hope the phone has a handle on the OS’s apparently battery draining habits. The rear cover is looking quite different from the previous gen Moto G and it appears to have rubbery texture. It is however quite possible what we’re seeing here is an alternative cover, which the Moto G tends to have multiple options to choose from. We don’t know much else about the device yet and there’s no sign of a local launch date as of yet so we just have to sit fingers crossed on whether or not this is the real deal.

There’s a high chance you have authenticated your identity with your email service using your smartphone. It’s an extremely common and easy way to get access back to your account but this also presents a potential vulnerability if someone has your phone number and email address. A bit of creative texting and catching you off guard is all someone needs to compromise your email account. This phishing attempt is then started by initiating a verification code process with your email provider and having them send a text message to your phone with the code. Then they will immediately follow-up with a message about unauthorized activity and for a response with the authentic authorization code. While it does appear suspicious, if you happen to be in the middle of something you probably won’t think twice about responding with the code. After that the perpetrator is more than able to get access to your mail and lock you out. This is twice as bad if you happen to have important information stored on your account (which you likely do) and could lead to more than just being inconveniently denied access. Below is a video by Symantec detailing how exactly this happens and how to avoid getting tricked into losing control of your email account.

And while we were there, our entire 4 days connectivity was reliant on a U Mobile Prepaid SIM.  If you’re wondering why U Mobile, it’s because we wanted to test out just how well the roaming plan worked for us while spending our time down under. Considering that they were offering up to 50MB free of international roaming a day (at selected countries), we really had to try it out. That’s not all though, you also have the option of enjoying unlimited data roaming for both U Mobile pre-paid and post-paid at only RM30/day. Yep, you read that right. Not 50MB, not 500MB but unlimited internet on roaming. So before our trip started, gotten ourselves U Mobile’s  i60 plan  on prepaid for the iPhone, that’s loaded with RM280 worth of credit.

That being said, after the RM60 deduction for the i60 plan, we were left with RM220 worth of credit. That would have been more than enough for 4 days of international roaming right? Well that’s what tried to find out."

The brand has already been around for a bit but this is the first time they have official local presence as they make their way to more countries in the Asian region. Fitbit which started in 2007 is currently the  #1 brand for wearables  according to the latest figures from IDC.  The full lineup of available Fitbit activity and sleep trackers will include the Fitbit Surge, Fitbit Charge HR, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Zip and the Aria WiFi smart weighing scale. For those looking for something simple to start off, the Fitbit Flex and the One pretty much function the same way but have different form factors and slightly different features. If you’re looking for more functions with greater active lifestyle, then the Charge, Charge HR and the top of the line Surge might suit your taste. The Charge gets some “Smart Watch” functions like caller ID, text notifications and the Charge HR gets additional continuous heart rate monitoring for the hardcore fitness junkies. The Surge gets more features that are encroaching the smart watch space with GPS capability and larger touch screen but in most aspects, it is closer to a  Pebble  than it is to an  Apple Watch . To make their stand clearer, they are not calling the Surge a smart watch but instead as a Fitness Super Watch. When it comes to heart rate sensors, fitbit prides itself of having an always on tracking. Unlike other smart watches that measures on demand or during periodic moments, the fitbit Charge HR and Surge monitors your heart rate 24/7 even while sleeping to give you a better picture of your health. Despite having to track non-stop, both products are rated to last up to 7 days on a single charge, which is better than most smart watches in the market. Furthermore, charging we are told takes just 20 minutes which is pretty quick. All fitbit products are water resistant however they are not designed for swimming or to be submerged under water.  How Fitbit is differentiating itself is their platform and user experience. Essentially Fitness is their main focus and the main star of the show is their app and fitness tracking platform. The official app is constantly updated to provide an optimal experience and there’s a gamification element that keeps you motivated by pitting yourself against your family and friends. Apart from the usual live fitness activity scoreboard, you can also engage into a short term weekend warrior challenges with your mates. If you’ve been using other apps, it integrates with 3rd party apps including Strava, RunKeeper and MyfitnessPal.  Of course there is also the widespread compatibility with popular smart phones including Android, iOS and even Windows Phone. It even supports older smart phones like the iPhone 4S and the Galaxy S3. The app that works across all the devices that pretty functions as your progress tracker and allows you to log your activities in real time. The app automatically syncs to the Aria scale too. During its media preview this morning, its Regional Director Steve Morley has shared that the smart phone penetration and the growing interest of fitness and prompted fitbit to launch its official presence in Malaysia. Malaysian consumers can expect greater visibility in stores and they have engaged a couple of authorised retail partners to sell their products on ground.  The lineup will be priced as follows: The devices will be available through official retailers including RadioShack, All IT Hypermarket, A One Plus, iStore, Harvey Norman and Superbuy.

OPPO is  aware  of the situation and they had even released a guide on  how to spot a fake  N3 smart phone.  The sale of fake products would obviously harm their brand as unsuspecting victims would experience sub-par quality compared the real deal. To step up its campaign against cheap fakes, OPPO Malaysia has introduced an online IMEI checking tool for users to verify their smart phone purchase. An IMEI is a unique number which is assigned to each mobile device, or you can think of it as an universal serial number. To access it, you can either dial *#06# or you can get it from the label that’s printed on the box or underneath its removable back cover. Once you’ve obtained the IMEI number, just key it in over  here  and it will verify if it is an official set along with its model number and full specification.  If you suspect someone is selling you a fake OPPO smart phone, you can now check on the spot before parting away with your hard earned cash. As always, do buy your smart phones from authorised dealers. If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is. For more info, head over to OPPO’s  IMEI checker ."

After revealing its  Snapdragon 810  powerhouse, the 2 will be having a USB Type C connector instead of a usual micro USB connector. If the OnePlus 2 is to be released soon, this could be the first flagship Android to use this new reversible connector. The USB Type C which looks like Apple’s lightning connector is seen as the new standard for charging and data transfer. It was developed alongside USB 3.1 so you can expect higher data transfer speeds without the bulky micro USB 3.0 connector head that came with the Galaxy Note 3. The new Chromebook Pixel uses it and even latest lightweight MacBook has one without additional thunderbolt or USB ports. For Apple, this is looking like the defacto choice for charging cable. There are some mobile devices adopting USB Type C, which includes the  Nokia N1  as pictured above and some other Chinese smart phone models like the  LeTV Max . Perhaps in the next 1-2 years, we can finally settle for a single cable that’s truly universal. After the OnePlus 2, hopefully the new flagships launched in Q3/Q4 would offer USB Type C connector as standard. [  SOURCE  ]"

The Deus Ex Aria is a Kickstarter project that actually makes this possible by transforming your smartwatch into something a little more hands free, pun intended. The Aria comes in two forms, a clip for Android Wear watches and a special strap for the Pebble Time, but is compatible with all Android Wear watches, including the ones you see below. In its clip form, its very small and unobtrusive as to not add too much extra bulk to your smartwatch. Basically, the Aria uses sensors to recognise gestures, specifically that of your fingers to navigate and otherwise control your device. Primarily the Aria lets you access your smartwatch without having to touch it, but it can also be used to control your smartphone as well. Answer your calls, swap through your music collection and even check or read your email. The device can even be hooked up to your GoPro via your smartphone to remotely send commands to the camera. This opens up a whole new world in how you can interact with your smartphone and wiggly fingers is just the tip of the iceberg.  The gestures are customiseable too, so you can tweak it to your personal preferences. The company is also releasing an SDK for any developers who are interested in producing apps for the device. They are hoping that the Aria can be used for other more complex actions like interacting with notebooks and perhaps even flying drones in the future. The Kickstarter project has under a month to go, so you can  check it out here  if you’re interested in supporting the Aria. Check out the videos below to get a peek at what the Aria really can do."
soyacincau,The Apple Watch: It isn’t the game changer we’re looking for,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/23/the-apple-watch-it-isnt-the-game-changer-were-looking-for/,,,2015-06-23,"Like it or not, Apple is often seen as the benchmark in every product line. The iPhone revolutionised how touch screen smart phones work while the iPad turned out to be the  fastest selling  consumer product in history.   The truth is Apple never created anything new. They were not the first to create a smart phone, a tablet or even a music player. But somehow they managed to take an existing product and turned it into something new, prompting you to ask yourself “why didn’t anyone think of that?”  As wearables are seen as the next hot category, Apple has finally jumped onto the bandwagon with the Apple Watch. Its competitors especially from the Pebble and Android Wear camp had an early start and this should give Apple some insights on what to do, and what not to do. Can Apple emulate the same success with the Smart Watch? Or is it all just for looks? Find out in our review. First up, let’s go through the entire range of the Apple Watch. Unlike any smart watch or Apple products released so far, the watch has the most customisation you can buy right from the store.  There are 3 main models, the entry-level Apple Watch Sport, the mid-tier Apple Watch and the cream of the crop Apple Watch Edition. To fit different wrist sizes, it is available in 38mm and 42mm editions, where the dimensions represent the height of the watch.  The Apple Watch Sport gets an aluminium case in either silver or space grey. It feels similar to the iPhone 6 and the front is toughen with strengthen Ion-X class. Being a base model, it comes only with a choice of multi-colour rubber bands. The strap mechanism is the same as the rest of its models which allows you buy the more premium bands separately.  Moving up a notch is the Apple Watch which gets a stainless steel case with a shiny chrome finish or space black. For those who consider money as no object, the Apple Watch edition can be yours in either 18 carat yellow or rose gold bodies. The front glass for the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition is more durable with the use of Sapphire Glass, while the back uses ceramic for better scuff resistance compared to the standard Sport version.  Unlike the Sport, the higher Apple Watch and Watch Editions get a wider choice of bands which includes leather and metal. As you go up a notch, you can feel the weight difference on your wrist. For example the 42mm Apple Watch Sport with the rubber sport band weighs just 30 grams and it gets heavier at 50 grams with the stainless steel body Apple Watch. Meanwhile the rose gold Apple Watch Edition weighs 67 grams while the yellow gold option is heavier at 69 grams, and this is with the base rubber sport band. That’s more than double the weight of its entry-level aluminium version.   Regardless of which Watch you pick, you get the same internals inside except for its screen and battery. The 38mm and 42mm versions have a slightly different screen size with a resolution of 272×340 and 312×390 pixels respectively. Despite the variation on paper, both OLED displays shouldn’t differ much in clarity as they push the same pixel density of 326ppi (pixels per inch).  On-board it gets 8GB of storage and it uses Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi for connectivity. Apart from the display, the battery of the 42mm version is said to be slightly bigger but its battery life shouldn’t differ much in real life usage compared to the smaller 38mm unit. For this review, we’ve gotten ourselves a 42mm Apple Watch Sport with a green sport band."

Yesterday we reported that Samsung’s pre-installed  keyboard had an exploit  that could completely compromise your phone. Samsung has now announced that it is taking care of the problem using their own KNOX security feature. While the keyboard looks nothing like SwiftKey,  its the SDK  that Samsung uses for their word predictive feature that makes it vulnerable. To recap, the exploit makes it possible for people with malicious intent to modify or install apps without your knowledge, grab GPS coordinates and access your camera, microphone, messages and locally stored files and Samsung believes that over 600 million phones are likely to be at risk. Samsung KNOX is essentially a secure sandbox that they can use as a conduit of the fix and Samsung can bypass the need to send a firmware update out to the carriers to test it before it goes out to rectify the exploit faster. The new security policy updates will be rolling out in a few days so Samsung users can rest easy. To doubly make sure you get your update for the fix, follow the steps below. 1. Enter your main settings menu and open the “Security” section. 2. Scroll down to “Other security settings” and elect “Security policy updates” 3. Check “Automatic Updates” [ VIA ,  1] [ SOURCE ]"

Now Samsung is jumping into the same bandwagon with its new Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7, which both sporting a 5MP f/1.9 front camera like the  Galaxy S6  that’s assisted with a front facing flash light.  The Galaxy J series which includes the  Galaxy J1  is their entry-level line up which is positioned below the Galaxy A series. The new 2 models seem to step things up by offering larger HD screens and better specs underneath. The Galaxy J5 comes with a 5″ HD 720p screen while the J7 gets a slightly bigger 5.5″ display but pushes the same HD 720p resolution. Details of the processor isn’t that clear and the J5 is likely to run on a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410 processor with 1.5GB while the J7 could be running on a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 1.5GB as well. On-board storage is reported to be 16GB with the option to expand using microSD. Despite being an entry-level device, the Galaxy J5 and J7 seems to offer the same selfie features as their flagship models. This includes 120 degree wide angle selfie and beautification mode for that extra touch up on the fly. For the back, it gets a 13MP shooter for both models. In terms of battery, the J5 gets a 2,600mAh unit while the J7 naturally gets more at 3,000mAh. It runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box and is available in either Black, White or Gold. So far it is announced for the Chinese market with the Galaxy J5 going for 1,398 CNY (about RM837) while the J7 is at 1,798 CNY (about RM1,076).  Late last year, Samsung is reported to be  cutting down  on its product line up to maintain profitability. With an extensive portfolio of Galaxy S, A, E and J series, it looks like business as usual for the Korean smart phone maker.  [  SOURCE  ]"

At 5.1mm thick, Micromax is claiming to have the World’s Thinnest Smart Phone beating the anorexic smart phone models from China.  How is this even possible considering the  OPPO R5  and even the  Vivo X5 Max  have been boasting incredible slimness below 5mm?  For starters, the Micromax Canvas Sliver 5 gets an all flat design, similar to the  Huawei P8  which has no protruding camera lens at the back. With the pursuit of being incredibly slim, most smart phones makers couldn’t shrink their camera modules further resulting an awkward bump at the corner. If measured on the thickness point, the OPPO R5 and Vivo X5 Max are said to be 6.9mm thick, which is similar to the iPhone 6’s dimensions.  With that in mind, Micromax claims to be the genuine holder of the thinnest title as the overall device is evenly slim at just 5.1mm. Surprisingly the closest competitor is the  Gionee Elife S5.1  at 5.15mm, which was announced during MWC 2015.  Thinness aside, the Canvas Sliver 5 is quite an entry-level device. It gets a 4.8″ HD 720p AMOLED display with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. There’s a decent 16GB of storage but unfortunately there’s no microSD expansion slot. For imaging, it settles for a Sony 8MP main camera while selfie duties are handled with a front 5MP camera. Packing just 2,000mAh which is pretty decent for its specs, the Canvas Sliver 5 is incredibly light at only 97 grams.  The Micromax Canvas Sliver 5 is priced at 17,999 INR (about RM1,045) and it will go on sale in India starting next month. This puts it within the similar price bracket as the  Samsung Galaxy A5  and it also supports 4G LTE with a single SIM slot.  [  SOURCE  ]"

In terms of pricing, they shared that the new Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor is much more advanced and complex compared to its Snapdragon 801 Quad-Core processor that’s powering the current OnePlus One. They shared that the cost of the processor is about 60% more and this will definitely drive the price beyond US$322 (about RM1,194).  At time of launch, the  OnePlus One  was priced at US$299 (about RM1,108) for 16GB and US$349 (about RM1,294) for its 64GB version. With the recent price slash, both models are now selling at US$249 (about RM923) and US$299 (about RM1,108) respectively. In Malaysia, the OnePlusOne is currenly sold at RM1,199 and it is exclusive to  Maxis .  With regards to its processor, OnePlus 2 will be using the latest Snapdragon 810 V2.1 variant which supposedly offer better thermal efficiency than the earlier models powering the HTC One M9 and LG G Flex 2. They added that all of its 8 same cores are optimised for stability and they will run it at a lower 1.8GHz clock speed for it to stay cool. So in a way, the processor has been throttled considering the rest of the competition using the newer V2.1 variant like the  Xperia Z3+/Z4  and  Mi Note Pro  are running its 4x Cortex-A57 cores at a higher 2.0GHz.

Basically what they will be doing is they will design the new products but won’t actually be making the products themselves despite having their branding. Given the reputation Nokia has, it shouldn’t be too difficult to get people interested in their products again but they have their hands tied till the second half of next year due to contracts with Microsoft.

Also the next Apple Watch is rumoured to be adopting Wi-Fi compatibility to make the watch less dependent on your phone and capable of more on its own. The Wi-Fi chip will also allow the Find my Watch feature to work better and allow the company to track the watches via router triangulation instead of GPS. However this would impact the battery life so Apple is attempting to get more usage time out of the battery; which as it is only lasts about 18 hours at best with varied usage. Ultimately Apple is planning for more models of the Watch, but we don’t know yet what are they planning in terms of design, materials or other potential factors in the make of the next gen Watch.

Sirap Bandung,Samsung’s default keyboard is vulnerable to open attacks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/17/samsungs-default-keyboard-is-vulnerable-to-open-attacks/,"Keyboard,mobile device,Samsung,samsung exploit,Samsung Galaxy S4,Samsung Galaxy S5,Samsung Galaxy S6,samsung swiftkey,SwiftKey","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-06-17,"UPDATE : Samsung  addresses  the keyboard vulnerability issue using KNOX. If you happen to own a Samsung  Galaxy S4 , Galaxy S4 Mini,  Note 3 ,  Galaxy S5  or the more recent  Galaxy Note 4  and  Galaxy S6 , we have a bit of bad news for you. Samsung’s built-in stock keyboard apparently has an exploit that might potentially allow people to execute code remotely on your phone no thanks to a flaw in the SwiftKey  software . Basically if you are connected to an unsecured access point like an open WiFi network it’s possible for someone to intercept and alter SwiftKey language packs as they update and upload a malicious payload by impersonating the server which updates the software. If the flaw is exploited, people could get access to sensors and resources on your phone like the GPS, camera and microphone, eavesdrop on voice calls and messages, attempt to steal your personal data and otherwise mess with the apps on your device. However, the problem lies strictly with phones that come with Samsung’s version of SwiftKey as the problem doesn’t affect those who downloaded it from Google Play or the App store. Samsung has already been notified by the issue and they are working on a patch for it but for now its best to avoid public hotspots that aren’t secure, use a VPN or just keep to your personal secure networks till there’s official word of the fix.

In terms of design it looks like it shares the same flat edge design as the  Samsung Galaxy Alpha , but has some design influences from the  Galaxy S6  as well. The frame generally looks like its will have the metal rim which is more or less Samsung’s signature styling. The device is rumoured to come in at 157.7 x 76.7 x 5.9mm and apparently is just 140g in weight; literally making it the slimmest smartphone Samsung has produced to date. We also get a glimpse at the specs of the device. The Galaxy A8 will be getting a slightly larger 5.7 inch Super AMOLED display at a 1080 x 1920 resolution as well as an octa-core Snapdragon 615 chipset mated to 2GB RAM. You will also have 16GB expandable storage as well as a 3,050mAH battery and Android 5.1.1 out of the box. The camera combo will be a 16 megapixel rear snapper and a 5 megapixel selfie camera up front. Compared to its predecessor, the device will have a larger display than the Galaxy A7 which has a 5.5 inch display as well as a larger battery than it’s 2,600mAh powercell. We don’t know yet when the device will be a China exclusive or the date of release but we really hope that Samsung manages to actually make it as thin as its claimed to be. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"
Sirap Bandung,The Lumia 940 rumoured to be sporting a three-LED flash,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/17/the-lumia-940-rumoured-to-be-sporting-a-three-led-flash/,"Lumia,lumia 940,lumia 940 XL,microsoft,Microsoft Lumia 940,Microsoft Lumia 940 XL,rumour mill,triple-LED flash","Microsoft,Rumour Mill",2015-06-17,"Apart from rumours that Microsoft’s coming flagships the Lumia 940 and Lumia 940 XL will have  USB Type-C connectors , 20 megapixel camera and  Quad-HD displays , the latest one is pointing towards a  triple-LED flash for the rear camera. A blurred out photo was put on Twitter which is said to be that very same camera. The image comes from @evleaks but has been blurred out so as to not reveal too much but it was still the basis of a 3D rendering that gives us a much clearer look at it. The image shows what looks like three LEDS above the lens. Dual flash tech is already pretty widespread as it is but not many have tried tackling three, but the colour difference between the LEDs hints towards a colour spectrum sensor. The only other device currently out there right now to have a three-LED array is the  Lenovo Vibe Shot  which looks more like a camera than a phone. To recap on the specs of the device, the the Lumia 940 is rumoured to have a 5.2 inch display on 2560 x 1440, 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage on top of a 3,000mAh battery. It will also apparently sport a 20 megapixel camera which isn’t too alien for Lumia phones considering their heritage of having huge snappers out back. On the Lumia 940 XL phablet on the other hand will apparently have a larger 5.7 inch display but similar internals as the Lumia 940 with the exception of a slightly larger battery at 3,300mAh and a Snapdragon 808 processor under the hood. So far the devices are looking pretty promising and we honestly can’t wait to get our hands on the actual unit. [ VIA ] [SOURCE ]"

Just in case 128GB isn’t enough, you can still add on a microSD card as well. Powering the device is a 3,000mAh capacity battery and it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. Connectivity wise, it should also support dual-SIMs with 4G LTE. During its debut, the 128GB was  initially spotted  in India without any announcement.

When you check out their online store, strangely Tune Talk is selling the devices higher than the recommended retail price with their Galaxy S6 being sold at  RM2,754.94  and S6 edge at  RM3,284.94 . The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge was  launched  in Malaysia at RM2,599 and RM3,099 respectively inclusive of 6% GST.

For those craving for more internet for the least amount of money, Celcom appears to have the best deal in town with its  FIRST Basic 38 plan . You get 3GB of data, 50 minutes of calls and 50 SMS each month for just RM38. To top it off, you are even allowed to carry forward unused data to the following month. Now Digi appears to have something up their sleeves which could offer more value at an even lower price. A reader had brought to  our attention  on a new unannounced RM36 Digi plan and the folks at  MDroid.my  have gotten more info on the new counter plan offering.  What could be a limited time promo in conjunction with its 20th Anniversary, Digi appears to have lowered its  Smart Plan 50  fee from RM50 to just RM36/month. To make the deal sweeter for data-centric users, they have added an additional 1GB of data to its High Data option. So in total, you’ll get 3GB of data, 100 minutes of calls and 100 SMS, all for just RM36/month. If you need more, their Smart Plan 78 (High Data) appears to be slashed from RM78 to just RM66/month.

As per current offering, the SmartPlan 78 comes with unlimited instant messenging via WhatsApp and WeChat, and Zero data charges on music streaming with its  Music Freedom  offering.

How it works is that the app will allow you to share your photos with friends who are in the shot and get photos you are in as well. It accomplishes this by syncing photos and connecting people with facial recognition technology to find out who was there with you without having to plaster it all over your feeds or take multiple shots of the same thing. The app will then group together photos on your phone based on when they were taken and you can then privately sync those photos with specific friends and vice versa. You can also use the search function to find more photos that have specific friends in them too, so you can catch all the stuff you missed because you were busy snapping somewhere else.

They have put the blame on low interest of its  HTC One M9  and the Taiwanese maker is hoping to turn things around when they introduce a new  “hero” smart phone  in October. According to  Reuters , their home ground competitor ASUS seems to be interested in acquiring the troubled smart phone company. During its AGM, its chairman Johnny Shih didn’t rule out the possibility of acquiring HTC. Its CFO David Chan did acknowledge that there were internal discussions about it but normally it has been ASUS practice of growing organically.  During its heydays in 2011, HTC was worth US$33.8 billion but now it is reported to be valued just over US$2 billion. Just when Android smart phones were booming, HTC was the defacto brand of choice with its  HTC Desire ,  Legend  and  Nexus One . Now the landscape has changed with Samsung dominating the high-end segment while the Chinese brands are rapidly rising ahead with its high performance and affordable price proposition. With ASUS having a strong foothold in the affordable segment especially in South East Asia, acquiring HTC would give them more leverage to take on the high-end smart phone players.  [  VIA  ]"

Known for destroying a fair share of gadgets,  TechRax  has taken Apple’s most expensive Watch to the test with an effective 650 pounds of crushing force. Check out the video to see for yourself. Neodymium magnets are found in lots of applications, and the largest of the lot can be found in MRI machines, electric motors, generators and more often than not in your headphones and speakers for the smaller ones. Surprisingly despite being smashed, most of the Watch survived but the screen is effectively destroyed. However on plugging it in to charge the watch still gave an indication that it was receiving power so it is actually still working to an extent. Given the strength of neodymium magnets this size, anything would have a crushing end as even those a few cubic centimeters wide already cause physical injury when mishandled. So should you attempt this at home? Probably not unless you have way too much cash to burn."

In the performance department, the update has cut down power utilisation by YouTube and Facebook. As a result, you should expect longer battery life if you use these 2 apps often. For charging, HTC has tweaked its thermal management, so it should stay cool while being plugged in.  The HTC One M9 update is being pushed to users in Taiwan a few weeks ago and it will be trickling in to the rest of the world soon. For Malaysia, HTC has brought in the slightly larger  HTC One M9+  and they have started pushing a software update (version 1.61.707.4) weighing 382.5MB. There’s no details of its full changelog but the description merely states system enhancements along with important bug fixes. Hopefully this would improve the battery life as our One M9+ unit with its Quad HD display lasted an average of 8-9 hours on single charge.

Now it appears that Apple could be jumping onto the selfie bandwagon as well for its upcoming iPhone that’s expected to launch by end of this year. In the new Apple  iOS 9  developer preview, there’s a code that suggests support for Full HD FaceTime and high 240fps frame rate video recording as well. The biggest surprise is having to support a flash for its front facing camera. This opens up a possibility that the new iPhones may come with a front facing flash which offers better lit selfies in the dark. At the moment, most of its flagship rivals like the Galaxy S6 are boasting better low light shots with the use of faster f/1.9 lens.  For the upcoming iPhone, Apple is expected to make a jump to 12MP for its main camera. They have been sticking to having just 8MP since 2011 with its  iPhone 4S  to the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. For the front camera, they could be bumping its 1.2MP shooter to something higher, since most flagships are sporting at least 5MP these days.  If you take lots of selfies, is having a front flash a big deal to you? [  SOURCE  ]"

Once a strong platform made popular by its secure messaging service, BlackBerry now has a market share of less than 1%. While they are still introducing new BlackBerry devices like the  Passport ,  Classic  and  Leap , they are still far from becoming mainstream.  According to a couple of sources, word has it that BlackBerry could be making an Android based device. Whether they would abandon its current BlackBerry 10 devices isn’t really clear but we reckon it is unlikely at this point of time. This comes at a time where BlackBerry is now focused towards enterprise solutions especially its device management platform that works across various mobile OS including Android, iOS and Windows.  If BlackBerry is releasing an Android device, it may be a slider device that comes with a QWERTY keyboard like the BlackBerry Torch series. This would offer a familiar full touch screen display, bundled with a tactile feeling of BlackBerry’s signature keyboard. The slider phone was  speculated  a couple months back and it could feature a dual curved display similar to the  Galaxy S6 edge . Would you buy a BlackBerry if it runs on Android OS with a QWERTY keyboard?  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

This allows for longer private messages, making it a more viable as an instant messaging channel. In the meantime, they are making some changes to its API where developers and 3rd party clients would need to make some adjustments to accommodate to the latest changes.  This makes it easier to report problems to brand customer support on Twitter especially to airlines and telcos. With the current 140 character limit, usually one would need to split their messages into several DMs to get the full message across. Take note that this only affects DMs and the normal tweets will still retain its character limit.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

soyacincau,9 new things to look forward to with iOS 9,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/09/9-new-things-to-look-forward-to-with-ios-9/,"apple,iOS,iOS 9,iOS 9 features,iPad,iPhone,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Plus,ipod touch,Top iOS 9 features,WWDC 2015,WWDC15","iOS,iPad,iPhone,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-06-09,"Apple had unveiled its new iOS 9 at WWDC15, marking the 9th generation of its mobile platform. While on the surface it doesn’t look radically different since iOS 7, the new version brings a couple of major refinements for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch which are big on productivity and intelligence. In a nutshell, iOS 9 is supposed to work harder for you, to give you what you want based on your past and current behaviour. For those using the iPad for work, iOS 9 offers better multi-tasking features which has been present on other tablets in the market. It is safe to say that Apple has gotten some inspiration from its rivals.  Head after the break for our list of 9 things to look forward to in the upcoming iOS upgrade that’s due end of this year.  
On the far left of the home screen lives the new Spotlight Search, which is where the original Search panel was placed before it was changed in iOS 7. Based on your frequent usage, it will understand your habits and will suggest contacts and apps accordingly. So if you often load a certain app or contact a person at a specific time and place, Spotlight will pick this up and will recommend them in future. This is somewhat similar to Nokia’s  Z-Launcher .    They have introduced new Proactive Assistant, which is something that rivals Google Now. The popular voice assistant now takes into consideration the context of your request, such as time and location. So it can do things like reminding you of your next appointment along with the traffic info for your destination. If a call comes in from an unknown number, its proactive capabilities will try to match the caller from your past emails which includes the contact info so that you’ll know whose calling. Its search capabilities goes deeper now into the app level and you could even ask Siri to find specific photos, such as time or place where it was taken from your camera roll. On iOS 9, Siri is claimed to be up to 40% faster and is 40% more accurate than before.  
Notes is a great way for taking things down and it gets a whole lot better on iOS 9. It gets revamped with extra features like creating a checkable list and you can even sketch using your fingers and add items from Safari, Maps and other supported apps. This looks like Apple’s answer to Samsung’s S Note app that comes as standard with the Galaxy Note series. With iCloud, you can sync your notes across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.  
Apple Maps now includes public transport directions which covers buses, trains, subways and ferries but it will first roll out at selected cities. While exploring new locations, Maps will also show you what’s interesting nearby, from food, cafes, shopping to popular activities.  For better multi-tasking, iPad users now get Multi-Window. You can choose to slide over an app from the sides, which is very useful if you constantly respond to messages or social feed. For a more permanent set up, you can display 2 apps simultaneously in either 50-50 or 30-70 split.  The iPad also gets Floating Picture in picture video playback, where you can continue to watch your video in a pop-up window while you’re running other apps. This isn’t entirely new and Samsung has introduced this a couple of Galaxy models back. 
The keyboard now also doubles up as trackpad which is toggled by dragging two fingers. This makes it effortless to move the cursor around or to select text. There’s also direct copy, cut and paste shortcuts on the keyboard, making word processing a whole lot easier. The new keyboard and multi-window feature currently works only with the iPad Air 2, which is their most powerful iOS device right now. This is probably good news to those who bought an iOS device with the least storage capacity. For those who tried upgrade to iOS 8, most users would need about 5GB of free space to upgrade, which is a challenge with those using a 16GB device. For the new iOS 9, they had made updating more efficient by streaming the updates directly as opposed to downloading the entire package, that would require more space to unpack. As a result, iOS 9 would require just 1.3GB of available space to upgrade. 
A new feature which can be a life saver, iOS 9 now incorporates Low Power Mode. This helps to extend the final few bars of battery life by throttling its performance, reducing background sync and disabling unnecessary animations. They have done some extra tweaks including disable on-screen notification if the phone is facing downwards. With all the fine tweaks, Apple reckons that you can get an extra 3 hours of battery life and 1 hour of usage after upgrading to iOS 9. 
For those paranoid about security, you’ll be happy to know that Apple has beefed up its authentication process to deter unwanted access. The passcode is now longer with 6 digits and you can also enable two way authentication where you’re are required to key an extra password that was sent to another Apple product or phone.  
iOS 9 will be rolled out officially this fall, which starts somewhere in September. In terms of compatibility, it will be available for iPhones from iPhone 4S and above, and iPads starting from the iPad 2 and first gen iPad mini. In addition, it is also coming to the 5th generation iPod Touch. To sum up the top features on iOS 9, you can watch the video below: [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

While the name sounds simple, this is an epic replacement of its sexy looking  Mi Wireless Router  that came with 1TB of storage built-in. Design wise, it looks like a simple box with two plastic antennas but it packs a lot more than just a standard router.  You get an enterprise grade router with faster 802.11ac WiFi on 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, PCB based antenna array for better reception and a whopping 6TB of storage space using surveillance standard hard drives from Seagate and Toshiba. This allows faster read speeds up to 115MB/s while wireless file transfers boast 58MB/s speeds which are twice as fast as USB 2.0. In terms of ports, it gets 4 Gigabit Ethernet LAN at the back and a full sized USB port. On-board it is powered by a Broadcom 4809C dual-core 1.4GHz processor with 256MB of DDR 3 RAM. The router also functions as a media and NAS solution with a built-in client to handle video and torrent downloads. So before you head home, you can use a smart phone app to queue movies to download and watch them once you’ve returned. For an always-on 24/7 operation, the Mi WiFi is kept cool with a graphics grade cooling system with a large heatsink and a quiet cooler fan.  If you take lots of photos, the Mi WiFi also acts as a central storage hub and it performs direct backup from your cameras including Smart CCTVs like the  Yi Camera . The Mi WiFi costs 2,999 CNY (about RM1,801) for the 6TB version and if that’s too much, there’s a 1TB version going for 699 CNY (about RM419).  To boost your WiFi reception throughout your home, there’s an optional Mi WiFi Amplifier that’s going for 39 CNY (about RM23). Unlike other WiFi boosters or repeaters that could be cumbersome to set up, the WiFi Amplifier is as easy as plug and use. Just plug the Amplifier stick onto the Mi WiFi’s USB adapter and once the paring is done, you can use it anywhere in the house with a USB adapter.  No word on when this will be sold out of China but we reckon some grey importers would be able to offer this in Malaysia soon. For more info, you can check out the  Mi WiFi  product page."

The recently announced  BlackBerry Classic  and  BlackBerry Leap  smart phones are still running on a rather dated dual-core Snapdragon processors but they run on their latest BlackBerry 10.3.1 OS on top. For those who need more power, here comes a new high-spec BlackBerry which looks like another variant (possibly cheaper) of the Passport.   With the code name BlackBerry Oslo/Dallas, the upcoming device gets a similar Passport form factor which has a wider width. Instead of a serious business look, it gets a silver colour body that uses both metal and plastic. Just like the Passport, it gets a QWERTY keyboard with 3 rows that also doubles up as a trackpad. Spec wise, it gets a similar 2.2GHz MSM8974 processor from the Snapdragon 801 range, that’s mated to 3GB RAM and is powered by a 3,450mAh capacity battery. At the back, it also gets a 13MP main camera with optical image stabilisation. The device is said to be running on BlackBerry OS 10.3.2.2.150 and it could be launched specifically for the EMEA and APAC markets. For those who find the BlackBerry Passport too wide to handle, this new device doesn’t seem to differ much in terms of handling. For a more traditional BlackBerry size and form factor, the  Classic  would probably be the better option. If only they gave it better internals.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The device was originally introduced during  MWC Barcelona 2015  and preorders have been ongoing since late last month. Possibly due to Google’s limited availability in China, Huawei has to replace Google Services with its own for the watch to function in their home ground. Other markets like Europe, United Kingdom, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand should still be receiving their timepieces earlier.  To recap, the Huawei Watch is equipped with a 1.4 inch AMOLED screen with a 400 x 400 resolution at 286ppi. Under the hood is a Snapdragon 400 chipset alongside 512MB RAM and the watch will operate with Bluetooth 4.1.

For starters, the device will be launching with a 6 inch QHD display at 2560 x 1400 and the Exynos 7420 processor under the hood . This is a change from the original rumour that claims the device will be sporting an octa-core MediaTek processor that it was supposed to share with the Meizu MX5. But this could be taken as a sign that Meizu really means business considering the same chip is already in the  Samsung Galaxy S6  and  S6 edge . As far as looks are concerned, the device seems to have a flat glass pane out back as opposed to its smaller more plasticky sibling but it will have the same 20.7/2160p rear snapper as earlier models. The MX5 Pro is also expected to have more ram than the MX5 which has 3GB RAM under the hood, which could very well mean the device would be packing 4GB RAM. The Meizu MX5 on the other hand is rumoured to be sporting a smaller 5.5 inch display at full HD resolution, 3GB RAM an an octa-core MediaTek Helio X10 as well as a 2o megapixel main camera and 5 megapixel front snapper.

It seems to be quite similar to the  Samsung Galaxy Tab A  but with some differences in terms of specs. The listing shows the device would have a 9.6 inch screen with a 15:9 aspect ratio putting it at 1280 x 768 resolution, which is much more than what the Galaxy Tab A has. The Tab E also has  1.3GHz processor which is rumoured to be a quad-core CPU alongside Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. The camera you are getting here is a 5 megapixel snapper out back and though there isn’t any mention of a front camera it is likely to be a 2 megapixel selfie snapper. The tablet here is listed as a Wi-Fi version so its likely that there will be one that can run on mobile data as well and knowing Samsung there might be more than one size variant if they are following the same formula as the Tab A. UPDATE : The 690 TWD (RM83) price listed in the brochure is for the case accessory. So far there’s no official pricing for the Galaxy Tab E.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab E is listed to cost 690 Taiwan Dollars which equates to about RM 83 so it’s likely that the pricing is for a monthly installment. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

The 4G WiMAX telco says they have made improvements to its network and the campaign signifies its confidence to take on new subscribers. This is made possible with its  backing  by TM and SK Telekom. With the new promotion, new customers can sign up with P1 Broadband with RM0 upfront payment and RM0 first month subscription fee. This gets you connected without paying anything until your first bill. For Home users, you get a choice of 3 plans ranging from as low as RM51.94/month for 5GB of data at 1Mbps. For those seeking for unlimited connectivity, it is offered at RM104.94/month for 1Mbps and RM157.94/month for 2Mbps. Do take note that it is stated under its T&Cs that speeds will be throttled once you’ve used up 100GB. P1 is bundling the Home DX230 modem router for free on rental basis. P1 also offers a mobile MiFi option for those on the move. It gets the same plan offering but costs an extra RM10.60/month across all 3 options.  While you pay nothing during sign up, there’s still an activation fee of RM106 and the registration fee of RM53 still applies, which will be charged on the first bill. All plans for both Home and MiFi are tied with 24 months contract and they charge a termination fee of RM200 or RM300 if it is terminated within 12 months of subscribing. As P1 is trying to win back  consumer trust , 24 months contract is a bit too long just to give their newly improved network a try. Since P1 is confident that they are ready to play, perhaps they should consider offering a money back guarantee. Else you gotta be ready to pray that the network performs well for the next 24 months.  For more info, head over to P1’s  Ready to P1ay  promo page."

Looking like an oversized eight-ball when inactive, the BSP60 is colourful, chripy and most importantly would love to dance with you. The device is basically a cuter and smaller version of the “Rolly” which is shaped like an American football and gets around by way of two outer rollers that function as its wheels. While it still has wheels to get around, the BSP60 instead has three small wheels in its base and the main moving components being two “ears” at the top of it. The BSP60 is quite similar in function (minus the ability to “flap” as you would see in the video above) but likes to dance just as much as it would like to wake you up in the morning with your favourite tunes. Like many of Sony’s newer audio devices it will have NFC One-touchsupport. The device is also capable of intelligent hands-free calling, voice control, notifications as well as the weather report if you would like it. It even supports multiple languages and can be communicated with in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish. You almost forget that the BSP60 is actually a speaker with the things it can do. Check out the video below to see it in action. The Sony Bluetooth Speaker BSP60 is due to be launched near the end of this month and is currently available for pre-order for  £220/€299 (about RM 1262) across Europe, with customers also getting a SmartBand Talk during the promo period. No idea when we would be getting it though but we have hopes that we eventually will. [ SOURCE ]"

Now the device is finally official and it brings with it IP68 certification against the elements. Sharing some features with the vanilla version of the Galaxy S6, the device has a 5.1 inch QHD Super AMOLED display and Exynos 7420 chipset as well as the 16 megapixel rear snapper and 5 megapixel front camera combo. However you do get a significant boost in the battery capacity with a big 3,500mAh battery that supports wireless charging. Sadly there is no microSD slot this time so you will only be getting 32GB of internal storage. The device will also be running on Android 5.0.2 out of the box skinned with Samsung’s TouchWiz. As far as the IP68 rating is concerned, the Galaxy S6 active will be able to handle water of up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes and is shock and dust proof with added thermal resistance to boot. This is the same as what the  Sony Xperia Z3  has to offer in terms of water and dust resistance rating but with a much tougher outer shell. So if you accidentally drop it in the shower or down a rushing stream on your hike, the phone should be fine. The Samsung Galaxy S6 active will be available in Camo White, Camo Blue or Gray starting June 12th. Unfortunately the device is an AT&T exclusive for the US but we are sure that you should be able to get your hands on one through gray importers.

The  HTC One M9  didn’t perform as well as expected, with the brand blaming the sales performance on low demand for high-end Android phones. There isn’t much known yet about the new mystery phone but it will be something totally different from what HTC has planned for its 2016 flagship device. Its safe to say that it will be a smartphone and given that HTC will be a Windows 10 partner it is likely to be a Windows phone. Rumours are currently pointing at a possible  One M9  variant with Windows 10 slapped on but it doesn’t sound much like a flagship. But what could it be? maybe a new Butterfly 3 for international markets or a high performing but affordable priced Desire to rack in the numbers perhaps? HTC is also planning on realigning their goals and priorities with an increase in research and development investments by 4% for a  total of US$419.33 million while the marketing budget has been slashed down by 19.26%. The brand will also be focusing on some new market niches too, like the Vive virtual reality headset that it is developing with Valve. Hard to say where HTC’s new direction will take it for now but if it works out we could be seeing quite some change.   [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

Available officially only in China, the Yi Smart Camera now gets a new Night Vision model that allows better surveillance in the dark. Best of all, it still retains the same price as the previous model at 149 CNY (about RM90) per piece.  The Yi Smart Camera was  introduced late last  year as Xiaomi ventures into the smart home space. It’s a tiny round shape little camera that’s powered by microUSB and it connects via WiFi. The front lens is made of glass and it boasts a wide angle of 111 degrees. It will record videos at HD 720p resolution in 20 fps, which is saved onto the local microSD card. There’s no cloud storage required, thus minimising your broadband usage at home. To take a peek of what’s going on, you can use Xiaomi’s Smart Home app available for both iOS and Android to view the camera in real time as well past recordings which are taken when motion is detected. It even comes with a built-in mic and speaker, so you do get 2 way audio using the app.  With the new Night Vision model, the Yi Smart Camera gets additional 8 units of 940nm Infrared LEDs surrounding the lens. This helps to boost visibility in the dark up to 5 metres. The 940nm type IR lights are said to be less intrusive without any visible light pollution, while maintaining its picture quality in both dark and well lit situations.  The current non-night vision model is now priced at 128CNY (about RM78). If you’re interested, a couple of sellers on  11street  are selling the standard Yi Smart Camera between RM109 to RM149.

The first 2 devices are the  Xperia C4 , a selfie cetric device and the  Xperia M4 Aqua , which is a new mid-range waterproof device. The third model is said to be a long awaited Xperia flagship device and we know many would anticipate the  Xperia Z3+ , which is the international variant of its Snapdragon 810 powered  Xperia Z4  smart phone. However based on the  previous teaser  and a quick check at SIRIM, the new flagship device is likely to be its  Xperia Z4 tablet The Xperia Z4 Tablet is their flagship full sized tablet offering with a Quad HD 10.1″ IPS display that pushes 2560×1600 pixels resolution and it is powered by Qualcomm’s 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. Compared to its former Xperia Z2 Tablet, they have managed slim it down to just 6.1mm, which is the same thickness as the iPad Air 2. It weights from just 389g for the Wifi version. There’s 32GB of storage, a microSD expansion slot, 8.1MP main camera without flash and front facing 5.1MP unit. Keeping the lights on is a 6,000mAh capacity battery which Sony claims is capable of 17 hours of video playback.   
The Xperia M4 Aqua is their improved mid-range waterproof smart phone that comes with a larger 5.0″ HD 720p display, 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor, 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage. It supports 4G LTE connectivity and 13MP main + 5MP front cameras. Like the Xperia Z4 Tablet and Xperia Z3+, the microUSB port is exposed but it still waterproof with IP68 rating. Keeping the lights on is a 2,400mAh capacity battery which Sony claims to last up to 2 days on average use.  
For selfie lovers, the  Xperia C4  is a smart phone that’s designed for narcissists in mind. It gets a larger 5.5″ Full HD 1080p display and it runs on a 1.7GHz 64-bit MediaTek MTK6752 processor mated to 2GB RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. For imaging it gets  13MP main camera while selfies are handled by a 5MP shooter that comes with an additional soft flash light at the front. It also supports 4G LTE and the battery is slightly bigger too at 2,600mAh. Stay tuned for more details this coming Thursday."

To showcase how much power savings the new features bring in a real life setting, a  Nexus 5  was loaded with a copy of the Android M Developer Preview and measured against the same model with Android 5.1.1 in it. Of the new features that will be coming with Android M is  Doze  and App Standby which helps save on power in two different ways. Doze for instance is activated when your device is inactive for a certain period of time and causes your phone to go into a “deeper sleep” and halt processes that would normally continue running when on standby. Once you pick up your phone Doze gets disabled and it resumes as usual, doubling standby time. App Standby on the other hand prohibits inactive apps from getting network support and open jobs are suspended once your device is unplugged from the charger. When your phone is plugged in again, the apps will reconnect. This would work best if Android M gave users the ability to enable or disable the feature for particular apps. So how did the devices do? The result? after 8 hours in standby the Nexus 5 with Android 5.1.1 consumed just 4% of battery as opposed to the Nexus 5 with Android M which only consumed 1.5% battery. After 24 hours the Nexus with Lollipop had eaten through 12% of its battery while the Android M device had only consumed 4.5% of power during the same duration. After an additional 24 hours the Android 5.1.1 device had chewed its way through 24% battery while the Android M Nexus 5 had taken just 9%. In total the Lollipop device was projected to last for about 200 hours on standby while the latter was projected to last more than double of that at 533 hours on standby. LG and Huawei have also been rumoured to be in the process of producing the  next gen of Nexus  smartphones that possibly might come with Android M pre-loaded. Suffice to say Android M is already looking good from the power consumption department and we can’t wait to get a hold of the full release when its officially released in Q3. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

With the rise of new music services such as Spotify, Apple is now introducing Apple Music, which offers an “all you can listen” ad-free music experience including offline for a fixed monthly subscription.  Interestingly Steve Jobs didn’t believe in the subscription model and this is a big shift from its current approach of selling songs ala carte by track or album. Back in 2003, the Apple co-founder once said that subscription music services were going to fail and people won’t buy music as a subscription. “When they want music, they bought 45s, LPs, cassettes, 8-tracks, CDs and then they are going to buy downloads”, he said in an  interview . The Apple Music service costs US$9.99 a month per user, and there’s a family pack bundle of US$14.99 that covers up to 6 users in a household. As a promo, the first 3 months subscription is free. As comparison, its direct competitor Spotify’s premium ad-free service costs US$9.99 in the US and RM14.90 with 1 month free trial in Malaysia.  On top of that Apple has revamped its streaming radio offering with the big names of music curating these stations. One of such stations is BeatsOne, a 24 hour streaming station that’s handled by DJs like Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden and Julia Adenuga.  To complete the music service, there’s also Connect, a social platform that connects artists to their loyal fans. In short, it is like a micro blog where fans can subscribe to, to get the latest updates, and even get first hand access to the latest albums.   Apple Music will be available starting 30th June across 100 countries and it will be rolled out with its upcoming iOS 8.4 update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Not leaving anyone else behind, it will also be available for Windows and Android users this Fall, which is in Q3 this year. As Apple Music comes pre-installed in every new device running iOS 8.4 and above, Apple hopes that more users would jump on board its subscription service especially with its free 3 month subscription offer.

Xiaomi  has a big event coming next week and they’ve released some teasers that are hinting at more than just one thing up their sleeves. The brand is known to product home appliances ranging from televisions to  home lighting solutions  and security. Previously they had introduced a  Smart Air Purifier  last year which was teased in a similar manner, with a vague teaser with just a date and the image of a fan. This time, the teaser is showing off multiple old-timey machines that could be hinting towards some brand new smart devices that could be incorporating some aspects of these. It’s possible that the new device could be a water purifier as one of the teasers hints towards such and Xiaomi does have quite a big water purification business in China so it’s quite possible.  There are also rumours that Xiaomi might be working on a water and dust resistant smartphone but at the moment this isn’t too likely. However the brand hasn’t made any substantial claims about what the event really is about so we will have to wait till June 10th to find out. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

Then came along the Microdia Xtra Elite microSD card that packs more than double of that, bearing the largest amount of microSD storage to date at  whopping 512GB in its teeny frame. The SDXC format allows for cards of up to 2 TB in volume but this is still the biggest we’ve seen so far. Microdia says the card will set you back about $1,000 (about RM 3712) and that’s almost twice the price of your average flagship device. However it should be mentioned that the vast majority of smartphones and subsequent microSD compatible devices do not yet support such a large external storage capacity; with the  LG G4  and the  HTC One M9 b eing the only ones so far that can support up to 2TB. You could argue that the card is quite future proof but it’s not entirely feasible till more phones (and cameras) can support microSD cards of this magnitude. But if you still insist on The Xtra Elite will also be featuring a Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus with data transfer rates of up to 300MBps and will be using version 4.0 of the Secure Digital standard which also gives it an additional row of pins under the usual ones. The card is mostly expected to be used my pro photographers by the manufacturer due to the large volume and speed. The card goes on sale in July though the final retail price hasn’t been finalised as of yet but this is one microSD card you don’t want to accidentally lose. [ SOURCE ]"

Initially available in developing countries, Facebook has finally launched the “diet” version of the app on the Google Play Store, Facebook Lite to help developing countries deal with sluggish data connections by trimming down the access fat for a simpler experience. The app has already been in development for about a year with the purpose of having it functional on any Android device regardless of what’s under the hood. Basically the features that have been removed are the most data sucking ones, like video and features like Nearby Friends to create a smoother experience even on older Android phones. The app also uses much lower-res thumbnails when displaying images so users won’t be running their data like water. To sum it up, the app is designed to use as little as possible and this is reflected in its practically weightless download size of 1MB. If you want to give it a go you can download the app  here .

The prototypes were shown off earlier this year at CES Las Vegas and they are confirmed to be running on a Snapdragon 400 SoC. The key selling point of the smartwatch is that it’s very modular, like the  Project Ara . You will be able to customise it as you see fit and the strap of the watch contain blocks that have swappable component sections which is how you will be able to mix and match. So if you want to add additional things like a GPS or a heart-rate monitor sensor, additional batteries or maybe even 4G LTE, you could just yank out a link and replace it with one you need. Even the smartwatch’s face can be swapped out from a square one to a round one if you so like. Interestingly, the device will be running on Android Lollipop instead of Android Wear and this will allow it to be compatible with both iOS and Android devices respectively. The watch planned to be produced via a crowd-funded campaign that’s set to emerge sometime within the next few months. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

Today, Huawei is the top-3 leading brand in the global smartphone market and a major global force in telecommunications and networking. Despite the success, the brand still has a mountain to climb when it comes to brand awareness and perception, because let’s face it, when it comes to prestige or premium, Huawei is not the first name that comes to mind, but the brand is moving in the right direction and it’s heading there fast. One such move is the introduction of the P8 VIP Service that upcoming  Huawei P8  users will be able to enjoy customer service that’s beyond what most other brands provide. Under the P8 VIP service, P8 users get a one-to-one device exchange for any faults or problems within the first 12 months of purchase. On top of that, if you bring in your P8 for repairs, you will get it delivered to you for free and if for any reason, the screen on your Huawei P8 is damaged, you can get one-time screen replacement for free. The only other brand that we know off that offer a similar level of customer service is Samsung with its  personalised customer service  for the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. The goal behind the P8 VIP Service, Huawei hopes, is to develop products and a customer service experience that meet and exceeds what customers are asking for rather than just making cheap phones that offer little else. Details on the P8 VIP Service in Malaysia will be made available closer to the Huawei P8 local launch. In the meantime, find out what we think about the Huawei P8  here ."

As predicted the smartphone has a 13 megapixel front and rear camera which sport Dual LED Real Tone flash on both ends for more natural looking selfies. The rear camera will also feature a rear laser autofocus as well as a large f/2.0 aperture. In terms of form factor, the Zenfone Selfie looks very similar to that of the Zenfone 2, especially in terms of the volume rocker come shutter button out back. 
 The Zenfone Selfie itself will be sporting a 5.5 inch IPS display with Full HD resolution at 403ppi that features Gorilla Glass 4 to protect against those accidental dings and scratches. Under the hood it will have a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, but we have yet to confirm the amount of RAM the device will be packing but we suspect it would be around the 2 – 3GB mark. The device does share a lot in common with the  HTC Desire EYE , that also features similar 13 megapixel cameras with dual-tone flash front and back. However the Selfie doesn’t enjoy the same water resistance that the Desire EYE has but instead benefits from a rear laser autofocus that should result in faster focusing. The Desire EYE also has a better Snapdragon 801 processor as opposed to the Selfie’s Snapdragon 615. Other camera-related enhancements include a HDR selfie mode, real time Beautification, Low Light Selfie and a new ZenMotion gesture dedicated to snapping you a selfie. The Zenfone line of phones are already well known to have good low light capabilities so we believe the Zenfone Selfie won’t be too different. The Zenfone Selfie will have a bunch of optional accessories available as well, namely the ZenFone Selfie Swing which essentially functions as a stand for the phone. You also get the ability to immediately view your selfie through the ZenFone Selfie MyView case without having to turn on your display so you can save on power.

The new tablets have been a long time in the coming, with  leaks  hitting the internet ahead of launch detailing the style and specs of the devices. Both devices sport a dual-texture design with a leather-like appearance for better grip and of course, style. On the surface, the tablets already look like they could give Samsung’s tablets a run for their money, with much better specs under the hood as well as the versatility that comes with the interchangeable Zen Case back covers for the ZenPad 8.0. In terms of internals the  ZenPad 8.0 will be getting an 8 inch IPS display at 1280 x 800 resolution and will be packing an Intel x3-C3200 processor under the hood alongside a 4000mAh battery. Most importantly the device supports interchangeable covers that either amp your battery life by a whopping 15 hours with the Power Case or turn your tablet into a personal entertainment device by giving it six additional speakers and is the first tablet to support DTS 5.1 Surround Sound with the Audio Cover. This combined with the fact that the unit already has two front facing speakers should make it quite the device to watch movies on. The ZenPad 8.0 will also have a simple 5 megapixel rear and 2 megapixel front camera combo and will be available as a LTE/WiFi and WiFi only model. The ZenPad S 8.0 on the other hand is all business, with a 64-bit Intel Atom Z3580 processor, 4GB RAM as well as a USB 3.0 Type-C connector which is a first for ASUS. The display will be similar to that of the ZenPad 8.0 but will have a much higher 2048 x 1536 resolution similar to that of an iPad mini. The device will also comes with the Z Stylus which seems to be very similar in function to that of Samsung’s S-Pen, albeit sized more like a normal pen with a 1.2mm writing tip as well as pressure sensitivity. Both tablets will be coming in 8GB and 16GB expandable storage variants, Android 5.0 and ASUS’s Tru2Life display tech for sharp images and crispy colours. Pricing and availability for the tablets have yet to be revealed but they will be available in three colours; Leather Black, Pearl White and Aurora Metallic come launch day."

The processor is also the same one that’s under the hood of the dual SIM  Redmi Note  so performance wise the devices should be relatively similar. Here is where the devices get a little different. The HTC Desire 826G+ will have a 5.5 inch display packing 720p as well as a 8 megapixel front camera and a 13 megapixel rear camera as well as BoomSound Support. The Desire 626G+ on the other hand has a slightly smaller 5 inch 720p HD display and has a 5 megapixel front and 13 megapixel rear camera combo instead. It’s pretty evident that the phones are likely aimed mostly at the selfie taking crowd, with the Desire 626G+ being the slightly lower end (and therefore more affordable) model.

soyacincau,Huawei P8: An impressive alternative to more expensive flagship phones,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/06/02/huawei-p8-an-impressive-alternative-to-more-expensive-flagship-phones/,"Android,Dual Sim,huawei,Huawei Ascend P8,Huawei P8,Huawei P8 Launch,huawei p8 lite,Huawei P8 Lite Malaysia,Huawei P8 Malaysia,Huawei P8 South Pacific Launch,mobile devices,Mobile OS Android,smart phone","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-06-02,"The  Huawei P8  flagship smart phone is officially launched in our South Pacific region and it is a huge step up from its predecessor, the  Ascend P7 . For the Malaysian market, Huawei Malaysia has  commenced pre-orders  at VMall at  RM1,799 . In Singapore it will be available starting tomorrow 3rd June for SGD699. With the  Galaxy S6  and the  iPhone 6  being top contenders for a high-end smart phone, Huawei aims to position itself as an alternative without burning a hole in your pocket.  In terms of design, the Huawei P8 gets a metal unibody design that’s only 6.4mm thick. That’s thinner than the Galaxy S6’s 6.8mm and iPhone 6’s 6.9mm thickness. The screen is a 5.2″ IPS Full HD display but with thinner bezels, it feels like a much smaller device in the hand. The overall build is much improved over the Ascend P7 and we  found it to be  quite similar to the  Sony Xperia Z3 . Powering the P8 is Huawei’s in house developed 64-bit Kirin Octa-Core 930 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. The early Kirin processors like the 910T on the Ascend P7 was quite mediocre, but the newer ones including the Kirin 920 on the  Honor 6  has been quite remarkable. On-board it gets 16GB of storage which you can put on a microSD card into its second SIM slot of the device. As photography is among the main usage of a smart phone, Huawei is put more emphasis on its camera capabilities. The 13MP main camera has Optical Image Stabilisation but Huawei claims it has been improved to tolerate shakes better at 1.2 degrees, double of what other smart phones are capable of.  On top of that, the P8 also boasts the world’s first 4-colour 13MP sensor. According to Huawei, this offers better brightness by 32% and 78% noise reduction in low light. The P8 also gets a DSLR-level ISP which helps to optimise its picture quality. In terms of features, the Huawei P8 is proud to showcase its light painting capabilities built in with its camera app. There’s no need to adjust shutter speed or manul settings and all you’ll need to do is to select the right mode and start drawing with any light source.  For more epic videos, the P8 has a rather unique Director mode that works in-sync with 3 devices You can have each P8 set up to capture different angles and the director mode lets you select the combine the right footages for the final video on the fly.  Being a flagship, a smart phone should be able to last as long as your busy schedule. With a 2,680mAh non-removable battery, Huawei reckons that the P8 could last up to 1.5 days in normal use or up to 1 full day with heavy usage. While most new flagships are boasting quick charge, Huawei surprisingly lacks any fast charging features on the P8. If the P8 does deliver all day battery life performance like the  Xperia Z3 , many wouldn’t mind the omission of a quick charge. On the software front the P8 runs on the Android 5.0 Lollipop with its own custom EMUI 3.1. There are a couple of smart features including a rather different knuckle sense. This lets you screen capture and crop using your knuckles. There are a couple of features that help to boost its WiFi and 4G LTE connectivity including a faster network lock-on while roaming. Also announced during the regional launch is the Huawei P8 Lite, an affordable compact version that’s also coming to Malaysia. It gets a smaller 5″ display that pushes lower HD 720p resolution, Under the hood, it gets a mid-range Kirin 620 processor with 2GB RAM, which is similar to the  Honor 4X . It gets 16GB of storage, 13MP + 5MP cameras and a 2,200mAh capacity battery. The P8 lite will be available in Singapore at month end for SGD329. During its London launch, there’s a larger  P8 Max  model boasting a huge 6.8″ display, 32GB of storage and a whooping 4,360mAh capacity battery which is rated to last more than 2 days. For our region, Huawei has no plans to bring this yet. If they do consider, it is likely towards the end of the year."

Dubbed the Nubia X8, this new phone was accidentally leaked on ZTE’s own website and has subsequently been pulled down but not before the internet got a hold of the details. In terms of form factor, the Nubia X8 has an extremely scrawny 7.9mm thick frame but manages to squeeze in some pretty good specs. The phone is expected to have a 5.5 inch or 6 inch bezel less QHD screen with a 1440 x 2560 resolution, on top of 4GB RAM and a choice of 32GB or 64 GB expandable storage that can handle up to 64GB. No word yet of the processor the device will be packing but it will also have support for 4G LTE and 3G on top of having Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. The device will also be sporting a very massive 5,120 mAh battery which should keep the phone juiced for a long period of time, possibly in support of all that extra multi tasking the phone will be capable of with the huge 4GB of RAM. The heavier 201g weight the Nubia X8 is mostly due to the battery but it’s a fair trade off for the battery you will be getting. We don’t have details yet for the possible pricing or release date but the phone will be available in Black and Gold colour variants. [ VIA ,  1 ][ SOURCE ]"

The image pretty much suggests a “price cut” or a trip back to the drawing board but it would appear that it’s more of the former rather than the latter, with  Maxis slashing prices  for plans with the device not too long ago. The new pricing for the device will apparently have the 64GB Sandstone Black model drop down to $298 (about RM 1091) while the 16GB Silk White variant will be repriced at $248 (about RM 908). Whether or not OnePlus is going to make global price cuts for the phone is still yet unknown at this point. However OnePlus founder Carl Pei stated that the OnePlus 2 will be unveiled only come the third quarter of this year, which again will be available through the invite system which has drawn a lot of ire from their existing fans. The company is going to make more available from the get go fortunately, having learned their lesson from initial sales of the OnePlus One. As of the moment,  leaked specs  for the smartphone include a Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon 810 mated to 3GB RAM, which is not as huge as the 4GB that the  Mi Note Pro  or the  ASUS Zenfone 2  is packing but it will give mainstream flagships a run for their money. Also, the devices are expected to ship with HydrogenOS for the eastern markets and  OxygenOS  for western markets.

It also gets a 13MP rear and 5MP cameras, along with a 2,200mAh capacity battery. The processor is similar to the Honor 4X but it comes with a tiny 2,200mAh battery. The P8 Lite also runs on Android 5.0 like its P8 siblings and it runs on their proprietary Emotion UI 3.1 on top. The Huawei P8 in the other hand offers a higher spec offering with a 5.2″ Full HD display with Kirin 930/935 processor mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board there’s 16GB of storage with a microSD expandable slot. For imaging, it gets a 13MP OIS main shooter plus a larger 8MP front camera. .

Enrique Iglesias has taken to using drones during his shows to get crowd shots and had developed the unfortunate habit of grabbing them mid-flight to get POV shots with his most recent attempt at his concert in Tijuana ending badly. So the singer sliced open his fingers on stage while attempting the stunt, spattering blood everywhere. To the singer’s credit he continued performing on stage despite being soaked in blood (and probably in a lot of pain) after the accident for about half an hour before being rushed on a flight to Los Angeles to see a specialist. Maybe he would have fared better if he had relied on something like the  Lily  instead. 
 So remember kids, grabbing flying machines out of the air isn’t cool, especially if you could end up missing your fingers. [ SOURCE ]"

Your smartphone is more than just a communication device, it’s the gateway to a whole bunch of entertainment all for your personal consumption. There’s a catch however, as great as your smartphone is for entertainment on-the-go, it still can’t beat watching all those videos on a big flat screen TV.  That’s about to change though as now there’s a way for you to put all that entertainment that you have on your smartphone, onto that sweet large flatscreen TV you have at home. How? It’s all thanks to the  Google Chromecast , offered exclusively by Maxis.  So what is the Chromecast? It’s a small dongle that attaches itself to a TV via the HDMI port. What it can do is allow you to cast your favourite entertainment from your devices straight to your TV. It’s really simple to setup as well. Just plug it into your TV, make sure it’s powered via power outlet or the TV’s USB port, set it up through the Chromecast app on your smartphone and you’re ready to cast. Now this simple gadget may not look like much but hidden in this little gem is a way to use your smartphone in a whole new way. So how will it do that? Here’s just a few examples As long as your TV has a HDMI port, it’ll work with the Chromecast. And that’s basically almost all modern flat-screen TVs out in the market these days. Now your smartphone can be home to a multitude of media, all of which would sometimes be wasted on a small screen. With the Chromecast, you can now push it all onto a much more comfortable screen. You can of course cast your favourite YouTube videos via its app or show of the latest snapshots you’ve taken on your phone via smartphone mirroring. However, you can do even more. 
Got a ton of videos and movies in your notebook or PC? With your Chromecast and an app called Plex you can now stream all of them wherever you go. The initial setup might take a little time, but believe us, it’s worth it.  First, sign-up for an account with Plex  (don’t worry, it’s free)  ( UPDATE : Sorry folks, it is no longer free but for $4.99 it is worth it). Then download the Plex Media Server program and install it in your PC or notebook that contains all those videos and movies you have. Then all you have to do is add your video folders to Plex Media Server program it’s ready to go. After that all you have to do install the Plex app on your smartphone and sign-in to your account. Now you have access to all your movies and TV series on your PC or notebook and their even nicely indexed into an awesome Netflix like menu system, complete with synopsis.  Need your music fix? Just get the Spoticast app that’ll let you stream Spotify to the Chromecast. Once you’ve done that  you’ll have access to a plethora of tunes which you can cast directly to a TV for your listening pleasure as well.  Can’t stand doing a video call on your tiny smartphone screen? With the Chromecast you’ll turn your plain old Google Hangout video call into something more inclusive and comfortable with your large screen TV.  All you need to do is mirror your device onto the TV via the Chromecast app on your smartphone where it is able see everyone, then start your video call via Skype, Google Hangout or even Facetime. Remember for best effect, make sure your smartphone is in landscape mode so you’ll be able to enjoy a wider video view on the TV. Why bother with a remote when you have your smartphone? That’s right with the Chromecast, your trusty smartphone can control your TV. Do take note that this only works with TVs that support HDMI-CEC. Just enable the HDMI-CEC setting on your TV, make sure the Chromecast is connected and constantly powered, and voila, any device (in this case your smartphone) that is used to control the Chromecast now become the primary remote control for the TV.  Still confused what HDMI-CEC is? Well here’s a tip, it’s called something different depending on the brand. Samsung calls it Anynet +, LG calls it Simplink, Sony calls it Bravia Link, Toshiba calles it Regza Link and Panasonic calls it Viera Link.  Well you can now  get it exclusively  from Maxis at only RM170 including GST and it’s open to everyone, not only existing Maxis customers.  If you’re a MaxiONE customer, there’s a treat in store for you as you can get it at a special price of RM150. Be quick though as this offer is valid till 30th June 2015 before it’ll revert to the RM170 price. For more about the Chromecast from Maxis, just head over  here . Chromecast Photo Gallery"

soyacincau,Google allow app developers to promote their apps easily on a single platform,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/29/google-universal-app-campaigns-universal-ad-platform/,"Admob,google,Google AdWords,Google Analytics for Apps,Mobile Ads,Universal App Campaigns","Industry in General,Mobile Apps",2015-05-29,"With the increase of smart phone and mobile internet adoption, mobile apps are set to grow even further. According to Google, there are over 5.5 million mobile app developers globally and 33% are from Asia Pacific (1.8 million developers).  As more apps are being developed, with at least  1.5 million apps  on the Play Store currently, it gets harder for new apps to be discovered. Mobile users on a average spend 30 hours per month on mobile apps and in the US, an average person has 36 apps installed but with a quarter of them not being used at all. There are several ways to push for new mobile app downloads but now there’s an easier way with Google’s new Universal App Campaigns. Previously app developers would need to embark on several campaigns such as Search, Display ads, Youtube and etc but this would take up a lot of time to monitor and to manage each platform’s performance. At the end of the day, developers are looking at the most cost effective way to increase their app downloads and dealing with multiple ad networks can be a pain especially if time is hard to come by. Now Google has introduced its Universal App Campaigns, which offers a single platform to not only integrate Google’s ad networks (Search, Google Display Network, Admob, YouTube, Google Play Search), but also over 20 other mobile ad networks including InMobi and Millennial Media. You just need to set up a campaign once and the Universal App Campaigns will run across multiple channels and it will self optimise for the best results. This saves time not only on set up but it also helps to manage your campaign budgets in a single entity. The campaigns can be self-served by developers themselves or via an digital ad agency. For monitoring, Google’s  Analytics for Mobile App  lets you better track the performance of your download campaign across different ad networks with better transparency. This works for both Android and iOS apps with an SDK. For more info, you can check out more info from the Google  AdWords blog .  [  SOURCE  ]"

When you open up the app, you get a list of current and recent broadcasts from people you are following and when you initially start up the app it will also suggest that you follow everyone that you are already following on Twitter. If nothing is happening on your feed, just swipe to show which broadcasts are currently available to watch. Swipe again and you’ll be presented with the most popular users on the app. So far, the app has proven popular with both celebrities and media personalities but it also has been used to  pirate pay per view  like when thousands turned to social broadcast apps to watch the “Fight of the century” for free, giving pay TV operators some headache. Periscope has also been used for  citizen journalism  as well. There are some differences between the iOS and Android versions of Periscope but the largest one is how you start your broadcast. On Android it’s a big red button on the broadcast screen while on iOS you will find it on the central tab. But generally the experience is about the same, letting you throw hearts and comments ala Instagram on broadcasts you like. The app is currently available for download on  Google Play  and will run on any smartphone with Android 4.4 KitKat and up.

soyacincau,9 things you need to know about Android M,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/29/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-android-m/,"Android 6.0,Android M,Android M Developer Preview,Android M Features,Google I/O,Google I/O 2015","Android,Mobile OS",2015-05-29,"Google has given a quick developer preview of its next smart phone OS, the Android M. After the introduction of Lollipop last year with an all new Material Design, the new Android M focuses on greater control and improved user experience. Some of the features aren’t new for Android smart phones but it is good that they have included natively as a standard for all device manufacturers. Here are 9 key take outs on the new Android M after the break. Permissions are now made simpler, giving you better control over how apps are using your contacts, SMS, calendar, camera, microphone, GPS and etc. Currently on the native Android OS, the permissions are asked only upon installation which naturally most users would just accept all without thinking twice.  With Android M, the permission request will appear only when you try to access a specific feature. So for example in WhatsApp, it will ask you if would you would allow WhatsApp to use the mic before sending a voice message.  Even if you passed that phase, you can still manage permissions of each respective app or you can check permissions on the feature level, e.g. what apps can access your calendar, contact or camera. From here you can grant or revoke access according to your preference.  Several Chinese brands including Xiaomi and Huawei has integrated such features quite a while back in their Custom UI. It is good move that Google is making this a standard in the next release.  Several apps usually would have a built-in web browser in them. Especially like Facebook and Twitter where it prefers to load external links within its own app.  The problem is it doesn’t get the same session and experience as a full browser. At times, you would need to re-login repeatedly. With M, they are introducing Chrome Custom Tabs for a better Web Experience within an App. As long as you’re logged in, your session, sign ins, saved passwords, auto-fill and even translate will still work if the app opens up a link in a Chrome Custom Tab. While it looks like it is part of the app, the web browser is actually running off chrome with a customised appearance.  Usually when a user clicks a URL link, Android won’t necessary know whether to load it on a native app or via web browser. That’s where you get the usual prompt on how would you like to open the link and if it is for just one time only as shown above. On Google M, developers will be able to define what links that support their apps and google will then verify if that link truly belongs to the app. So if a user, clicks on a link, they will be redirected to the right app immediately for a better user experience.  Looking like a reboot of Google Wallet, Android Pay aims to make mobile payments simple, secure and open source. To make payment, it is as simple as unlocking your phone and tap using the NFC terminal. For better security, a virtual account number is used to transact with the merchant. Therefore it protects you from revealing your actual card number, minimising the risk of possible fraud.  Being an open platform, users can make payments using their official Android Pay app or via banking or shopping apps that support them. In theory, it works with any Android device with NFC but of course it all depends on the banks and merchants to support it on the local level. Fingerprint scanning has started to become mainstream and most implementations we’ve seen today like the Galaxy S6, Huawei Ascend Mate 7 and HTC One M9+ are proprietary solutions. Google is finally supporting fingerprint natively on Android M and it will become a standardised API for developers to tap into. Battery life is always a concern and Android M boast better standby power efficiency with Doze. When a device is put on standby, it detects with motion sensor to know if it is being left untouched or being carried around. If it knows it has been left unused on a bedside table, it goes into deeper sleep state for extended period of time. According to Google’s own internal test with a Nexus 9, Android M lasts up to 2 times longer in standby than Lollipop. Google M will also support USB Type C and they are pushing it as a standard on new devices with fast charging features. Since it is bi-directional, they are throwing a native feature where you can choose it to charge on cable, and you can reverse charge, turning your smart phone into a power bank with a USB OTG Cable.   
Google Now isn’t just your voice assistant but it knows you based on your activities, behaviour and now it gets even better. With “Now on Tap”, Google Now understands you by context no matter what you’re doing on your phone.  So if you’re listening to a song, you can simply ask Google Now, what’s is his real name, and it will return a search result wihout you giving a full specific question. Sometimes you won’t need to say a single word at all. For example if you’re reading an email about movie discussion, press and holding the button will automatically show details of the specific movie along with reviews and rating.  These are some of the new features on Android M which will be released officially in Q3 with its official confectionery or dessert name. Some other new improvements include a better word/text selection with floating options. For those who don’t like the new Lollipop volume controls, Android M will give individual controls for different sound sources such as ringer, media, notification and alarm from the volume rocker.  What do you think M would be? Macaron? M&M? Mars? Leave your comments down below.  If you missed last night’s Google I/O 2015 keynote, you can watch the replay of it below."

Like the  iPhone , it isn’t the first smart watch, but Apple is expected to bring something new to the table which hopefully sets a new standard on how a smart watch should be.  While availability of the Apple Watch is limited only to a handful of countries, we managed to get one from Sydney, Australia just to find out if it is any good. To recap, there are 3 versions available – The Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. For the sake of trying it out, we got the cheapest of the lot, which is the Apple Watch Sport which costs us about RM1,600 (A$579) for the 42mm version.  If you’re wondering how is Apple packaging their wearable device, check out our unboxing after the break. Being a fashion item, Apple is taking a different route in packing their Watch. Unlike the usual one size fits all, Apple is packing each variant differently from each other. For the Apple Watch Sport which we have, it comes in a long box with the watch packed flatly inside a glossy looking case. Inside, you get 2 straps for different hand sizes but only 1 piece of its upper strap is provided. That means you get 3 rubber pieces in total, so you can’t  swap or sell your extra band  as a complete set.  Also included is a 1Amp charger and a magnetic charger which comes in glossy plastic white for the Apple Watch Sport. As comparison, the “Apple Watch” and “Apple Watch Editions” would come with a chrome looking magnetic charger which are boxed in a square case. The biggest difference compared to its more expensive variants is the build quality and type of glass. Being the entry model, the Watch Sport gets an aluminium body and toughen Ion-X glass which isn’t as scratch resistant as Sapphire.  So how’s the Apple Watch on a day to day basis? Watch out for our review coming right up. In the mean time, you can read our  first impressions  of the entire range, including their most expensive variant that cost over RM67,000."

Their  Mi 3  that was  launched in Malaysia  for RM889 was a serious disruptor, making everything else look ridiculously overpriced. After discontinuing the Mi 3, Xiaomi has been focused mostly on the lower end devices with the Redmi series. Their last flagship, the Mi 4 had  given Malaysia a pass  due to its limited 4G LTE support. Finally after a year since Xiaomi has entered Malaysia, they have introduced the  Mi 4i  which they consider to be their new flagship smart phone for the global market. Read on for our review of the Mi 4i. Looking at the spec-sheet alone, the Mi 4i is clearly a notch below its original Mi 4 flagship. Xiaomi wants you to believe that the “i” post fix stands for international, and in some ways it is true since it is only sold outside of China. In reality, the “i” stands more for “Lite” or a lower spec version as it runs on a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor with just 2GB of RAM. So why Xiaomi believes the Mi 4i deserves a flagship title? Well for starters, the display itself is a 5″ screen which is improved over the current Mi 4. While it pushes the same Full HD 1080 resolution, it gets additional Sunlight Display technology which automatically make adjustments on the pixel level to maintain visibility in sunny conditions. In our usage, it delivers as advertised and undramatic as it seems, we didn’t have any issues using the device outdoors at noontime. For the battery, the Mi 4i packs a higher capacity 3,120mAh battery which is their biggest ever fitted on a Mi smart phone. That’s more than their current top of the line  Mi Note Pro  and Xiaomi claims that this is the 2nd device to use this new efficient and dense battery type after the Galaxy S6. They added that the Mi 4i should last up to 1.5 days on a single charge and that’s made possible with its power saving optimisation with MIUI."

For the rest of the world, Sony has finally announced its international variant that’s called the Xperia Z3+.  On the surface, it looks like nothing much has changed but the biggest difference is on the inside. While the overall design and size looks the same as the current  Xperia Z3 , the Xperia Z3+ is lighter at 144g (Z3: 152g) and thinner at just 6.9mm (Z3: 7.3mm). If you’ve been using Sony’s waterproof smart phones, the biggest welcome feature is its exposed microUSB port that’s waterproof without the annoying flap cover.  The front 5.2″ Full HD display remains unchanged and so is its pair of front facing stereo speakers. The main 20.7MP Exmor RS camera at the back is the same as the current Z3 but over at the front, it gets upgraded with a higher 5MP front shooter with 25mm wide angle lens. In terms of processing power, the Xperia Z3+ gets the top of the line 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM. The storage has been increased from 16GB to 32GB on the Xperia Z3+ and yes, you are still able to expand with microSD up to 128GB. As expected with a slimmer body, the Xperia Z3+ is powered by a smaller 2,930mAh non-removabl battery (Z3: 3,100mAh) but Sony still claims that it could also last up to 2 days of average use on a single charge. Among all the flagships we’ve tested, the Xperia Z3 has one of the best battery life which gave us a full day of usage until midnight without needing a power bank. The Xperia Z3+ comes in 4 colours – Black, White, Copper and Aqua Green and it is expected to go on sale globally next month in June. For more info, you can visit Sony’s  Xperia Z3+  product page.

From the video, it looks like Cortana will function exactly the same for iOS and Android users as it does for Windows Phone users, but with some slightly limitations considering it functions as a standalone app instead of coming stock with the system. We don’t know exactly when Cortana is going to hit the App store or Google Play but there’s a chance the release will be at the same time as the Windows 10 launch later this year. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

It made headlines with its beastly amount of RAM, plus a few tricks up its sleeves. As far as looks go, the Zenfone 2 looks quite a lot like its predecessors with some not-so-minor differences. While the front sports the same general styling, the Zenfone 2 also features a curved back design that makes it easier to hold as well as a rear mounted volume control that doubles up as camera button just under the lens. In terms of specs, the Zenfone 2 is one of the few devices currently out in the market that sports 4GB RAM, alongside the  Lenovo K80  and the  Xiaomi Note Pro . The sheer amount of RAM makes a lot of difference in terms of performance, especially for more cluttered systems with lots of bloatware. The Zenfone 2 also gets a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 Processor at 2.3GHz with 4GB but there are more affordable variants with lower spec Intel processors mated to a decent 2GB RAM. ASUS has had a history of using Intel processors since they debuted the ASUS VivoTab in 2012 and it doesn’t look like this will change anytime soon. Almost every Zenfone released (except for  Zenfone 5 LTE ) to date has had one under the hood. The device also sports a dual-SIM setup with support up to 4G LTE on the first slot. You also get a 3,000mAh battery as well as Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box with ZenUI 2.0 on top. As far as the screen is concerned, it’s a larger 5.5 inch IPS display that pushes a higher Full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution. The model that we got to test is the top of the line Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) with 32GB storage capacity, meaning we get the whole beastly 4GB RAM to test out."

The new leaks give us a glimpse of the specs the two new phones might be packing and sources say that the phones are likely to be the Lumia 940 and Lumia 940 XL. As of the moment the Lumia 940 is rumoured to have a 5.2 inch display on 2560 x 1440, 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage on top of a 3,000mAh battery. It will also apparently sport a 20 megapixel camera which isn’t too alien for Lumia phones considering their heritage of having huge snappers out back. On the Lumia 940 XL phablet on the other hand will apparently have a larger 5.7 inch display but similar internals as the Lumia 940 with the exception of a slightly larger battery at 3,300mAh and a Snapdragon 808 processor under the hood. We don’t quite know if the specs are legit yet or when the device will launch.

Last year they sold about a million units through its limited invitation only sales and they have a target to sell 5 million units in 2015. Given its  Q3 target , it might be too early and perhaps it is a new OS update since OnePlus is trying to move away from Cyanogen.  From a purported  leaked benchmark , the 2nd flagship with the model number A2001 is spotted running on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. Obviously it isn’t the best spec compared to its rivals rocking 4GB RAM like the  Mi Note Pro . Given its lean Android OS and competitive price tag, the OnePlus Two could still give the mainstream players a run for their money. The current OnePlus One 64GB is currently  sold officially  in Malaysia at RM1,199 (before GST) and it is exclusive to  Maxis .  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The cause? A  specific line of unicode  that looks like random mix of arabic and other characters. This is due to iOS difficulty of rendering them on the notification screen and pranksters are using this to annoy iOS users until an official fix is released. To prevent yourself from being a repeat victim, the folks at iMore had shared a  few remedial  steps which you can take right now. Since the bug is triggered automatically from the notification screen, the obvious fix is to disable message notifications from appearing. For iPhone and iPad users, you can do this by heading over to Settings > Notifications > Messages, and disable “Show on Lock Screen”. The Apple Watch isn’t spared either, so you would need to do the same from the Apple Watch App under Notifications > Messages, and disable “Show Alerts”. Chances are, not many would be affected but who knows if you have that one friend who would take this opportunity to annoy you to the max.  If you do receive the troublesome line of unicode, you won’t be able to load the Messages app until you receive a fresh new message. To do this, you can get a friend to send you a clean message or send a photo to yourself from Photos.  [  SOURCE   2  ]"

The first generation Zenfone had  blown us away  with its Low Light mode and the new  Zenfone 2  is expected to do better with its bold claim of being able to  see what others can’t see .   To find out, we set up a extreme low light scene and compared the Zenfone 2 with other new devices including the  Galaxy S6 ,  HTC One M9+  and the new  Mi 4i . You’ll be amazed with the results. Similar to its predecessor, the Low Light on the Zenfone 2 combines its nearby pixels to increase its brightness tremendously. As a result, the final image is lower in resolution, so instead of a 13MP photo, you’ll get a maximum of 3MP. In our set up, we took the shot in a box that’s almost pitch black to the naked eye. As you can see, the Low Light Mode difference is like night and day, as if the box was fully illuminated from the inside.  When compared to the other models, the Samsung Galaxy S6 with its f/1.9 fast lens performed better than the HTC One M9+ and Mi 4i but it is no where as bright as the Zenfone 2. The Mi 4i however fares not too far behind and it has less noise with its Handheld Twilight mode compared to its standard Auto mode. The HTC One M9+ is no better and if you look closely, the noise is much more noticeable. It gets even worse in Duo Camera mode where the noise gets even more exaggerated as seen in the original sample shot below. Note that all these shots are taken without flash.  Granted that the Low Light Mode is only usable if you have very steady hands and it won’t be practical when used normally in the clubs. Nevertheless, it is still a remarkable feat if you really want to capture in the dark.  ASUS Zenfone 2 Auto

Initially speculated with a  front facing 13MP shooter , serial leaker  @onleaks  has revealed more details of its front design. With Sony implementing its omni-balance design throughout its latest product range, the upcoming selfie-device is looking to stand out with an edge-to-edge display. This is similar to Sharp’s  AQUOS Crystal  series but Sony is still retaining the top piece for its earpiece and front facing camera. Whether bezels are a bad thing is a separate debate altogether but this new design could be Sony’s new design breakthrough since the  Xperia S . Spec wise, the Lavender internals is quite similar with its current  Xperia C4  with a MediaTek MT6752 Octa-Core 64-bit processor with 2GB of RAM. The screen size isn’t confirmed yet but it is likely a full HD unit similar to the C4 and it is said to come with both single SIM and dual-SIM variants. For taking pictures, the Lavender is said to come with two 13MP cameras and the front claims to be a  Sony IMX214  sensor, that’s being used by a significant number of flagship smart phones. If this is true, narcissists can look forward to better looking selfie photos that’s just as good as the main camera. For night shots, there’s also a front facing soft flash as well. According the source, production of the device has started and it could go on sale by end of June. Who knows this could be launched at the coming  Sony events  that are held in Taiwan and Hong Kong this week.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Gionee’s upcoming phone has two batteries inside,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/25/want-double-the-battery-life-gionees-upcoming-phone-has-two-batteries-inside/,"Battery Life,Double Battery,Gionee,Gionee M5,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-05-25,"Smart phone makers are often looking at ways to increase the battery life of their devices. Fast charging sure does help to minimise the waiting time but nothing beats having to use the device for a full day without the need of carrying a power bank.  Apart from optimising power consumption, the common solution is to fit a high capacity battery into a smart phone. Now Chinese maker Gionee, that has an obsession of making  ultra-thin smart phones  has a different approach in mind. Like the teaser picture above suggests, Gionee thinks that having two batteries is better than one. Called as the M5, the new Gionee smart phone is said to feature 2 batteries inside. Without giving further details, Gionee reckons that it would provide up to 4 days of usage before requiring a charge. It isn’t clear if the 2 batteries are pushing the same power output or if they are of the same capacity. If Gionee can make a smart phone that’s both thin and enduring enough to last for 4 days, that would be an incredible feat which most users would drool over.  Apart from the M5, Gionee is preparing to launch its new Elife E8 that boasts a camera that can produce a 100MP image. Obviously there would be some software based resampling involved and it is said to be powered by a 2GHz Octa-Core MT6795 processor. We expect more details of its E8 and M5 to surface in the next couple of weeks before its announcement. [  SOURCE  ]"

That’s until they announced its larger  iPhone 6  and  iPhone 6 Plus  that came with much larger 4.7-5.5″ display.  As the screen gets bigger, it is tougher to stretch your fingers to reach the top corners especially where the on-screen back button is located. However they tried to make it usable in a single hand with its reachability mode. This is triggered by double tapping on the home button to shrink the current display. For Android, navigation is less painful on a large screen thanks to the standard back and recent apps buttons.  If you’re wishing for something similar on your iPhone, it is now possible and all you’ll need is just a screen protector. Unbelievable but true, this screen protector called Halo Back on  Kickstarter  can add a “back” button to your iPhone. How it works is quite magical and the idea is quite simple if you think about it. As our fingers conduct electricity, Halo Back essentially is a screen protector with an invisible circuit layer that connects the spot where the “Back” button is on the top of the display to empty spot placed towards the left of the home button. So if you’re tapping on that empty spot, it reacts as if you’re tapping the back button at the top. To date it has exceed its US$20,000 goal by over 3 times and if you’re interested, you can  pledge  for one at $17 (about RM61). Once it goes on sale, Halo Back is retailing at US$49 (about RM176).  This feature however isn’t entirely new. On the  Honor 6 Plus , there’s an option to move the on-screen virtual buttons to the bottom space along with 2 extra short cuts at the top. The implementation should be similar as it also depends on a special screen protector. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

When it was first introduced, the OnePlus One with 64GB storage  was offered at RM859  and that’s with a 24 months contract of MaxisOne Plan with an extra 1GB data subscription costing RM158/month in total.  Not only the contract pricing has been reduced, you no longer need to take up the additional 1GB of data at RM30/month. So it is RM799 with 24 month commitment of the base MaxisOne Plan of RM128/month. If you’re looking for something that’s less costly, the OnePlus is also offered on its lower MaxisOne Plan Lite that costs RM78/month. On MaxisOne Plan Lite, it is offered at RM799 with 24 months contract. During sign up, the MaxisOne Plan option (RM128/month) would require an upfront advance payment of RM512 while the Maxis One Plan Lite would need RM312 upfront.  The difference between the two plans is that the MaxisOne Plan comes with unlimited local calls and SMS with a serving of 2GB of internet. Meanwhile the cheaper MaxisOne Plan Lite offers unlimited calls/SMS within the Maxis/Hotlink network and it gets 1GB of internet. Any calls or SMS made to non-Maxis numbers will be charged at 15sen/minute for calls and 10sen per SMS.  Don’t want to be tied down? The OnePlus is still available outright without contract for RM1,199. Do note that all prices mentioned here are without GST.  For more info, head over to Maxis  OnePlus One  page.

The device might be labeled as the OnePlus One, that phone is instead running a quad-core 2.5GHz processor.   Not too long back, OnePlus founder Peter Lau had  suggested  that the OnePlus Two would have an octa-core Snapdragon 810 under the hood and the benchmarked device is sporting the chipset.

soyacincau,Compared: Top Smart Phones you can get for under RM800,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/21/compared-top-smart-phones-you-can-get-for-under-rm800/,"Acer liquid Jade Z,Acer Liquid Jade Z Malaysia,ASUS ZenFone 2,ASUS ZenFone 2 Malaysia,Comparison,Dual Sim,Honor 4X,Honor 4X malaysia,lenovo a7000,Lenovo A7000 Malaysia,Meizu m1 Note,Meizu m1 Note Malaysia,mi 4i,Mi4i,smart phone,Xiaomi Mi 4i,Xiaomi Mi 4i Comparison,Xiaomi Mi 4i Malaysia","Acer,Asus,huawei,Lenovo,Meizu,Mobile Devices,Xiaomi",2015-05-21,"The  Mi 4i  has  finally launched  for Malaysia and it packs quite a punch for just RM749. If you’re wondering what else you can get for the same price range, we’ve compared the Mi 4i with 5 other devices that come with 4G LTE.  Is the Mi 4i  the best smart phone  you can get for less than RM800? Read on to find out. 
 In Malaysia, the current top contenders that are priced below RM800 include the  Meizu M1 Note  (RM739),  Honor 4X  (RM619),  ASUS Zenfone 2  (RM749),  Lenovo A7000 ,  Acer Liquid Jade Z  (RM799) and the newly launched  Xiaomi Mi 4i  (RM749). Just for clarity, the Zenfone 2 featured here is their mid-range ZE550ML which comes with a 5.5″ HD 720p display and lower 1.8GHz Intel Quad-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. Display 
If you’re into big screens, the first 4 models are having a larger display size of 5.5″ where as the Liquid Jade Z and Mi 4i is having a more compact 5″ screen. When you look at the screen resolution, the Meizu m1 Note and the Mi 4i are the only smart phones to offer Full HD 1920×1080 screen solution with pixel density of over 400ppi. Obviously the Mi 4i would be the sharpest as it packs the same amount of pixels in a smaller screen size than the m1 Note. Processor & RAM 
To keep the price down, most brands tend to use alternative processors such as MediaTek, Intel or Hi-Silicon to deliver the best performance for your buck. We haven’t tried all 6 yet but from  our evaluation  with the Lenovo A7000, this could be the better performer in terms of benchmarks as it scored over 43,000 points on Antutu. The MediaTek MT6752m seems to be on par with a Galaxy S5’s Snapdragon 801 processor in benchmarks. As comparison, the Mi 4i with Qualcomm’s 2nd generation Snapdragon 615 processor claims that it would score slightly over 40,000 points on Antutu. In terms of RAM, all 6 are having 2GB RAM which is pretty decent in this category. Storage and microSD support 
Storage is quite a deal breaker for most users and these days it is hard to live on 8GB alone. On the list, the Meizu M1 Note, Zenfone 2, Liquid Jade Z and the Mi 4i are generous enough to pack 16GB of on-board storage. However out of these 4, only the Zenfone 2 and the Liquid Jade Z comes with a microSD expansion slot.  Camera 
As selfies being a mandatory requirement these days, all 6 phones are having a 5MP front camera. For main photography shots, all of them comes equipped with a 13MP main shooter except for the Lenovo A7000 which comes with a 8MP camera instead. For a more natural looking photos while using flash, the Meizu M1 note, Zenfone 2 and the Mi 4i comes with dual-tone LED flash. Connectivity 
All devices here support dual-SIMs with 4G LTE connectivity but there’s a difference in the slots. Usually dual-SIM phones have their secondary slot restricted to just 2G only, so if you need to use the 2nd SIM for faster data, you would need to physically swap the SIM card onto the first slot for 4G. For the Honor 4X, Liquid Jade Z and Mi 4i, both slots support 4G so you can enjoy full speed connectivity regardless of which SIM is active for data. Battery 
No matter how good the specs are, the battery is also a critical point for a smart phone. In this comparison, the m1 Note has the biggest battery at 3,140mAh and it is followed by closely with the Mi 4i with a 3,120mAh battery which is respectable for a 5″ device. For those who care about removable batteries, the A7000 is the only one here with the option. Dimensions 
Among the 6, the Mi 4i is the most compact of the lot and it is the thinnest at just 7.8mm. In terms of weight, the Acer Liquid Jade Z is the lightest at only 110g but this comes as no surprise as it has the smallest battery capacity at 2,300mAh.  Operating System 
If you’re getting a new phone, it is recommended to get one with the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop. Out of the box, the ASUS Zenfone 2, Lenovo A7000 and Xiaomi Mi 4i are running on Lollipop from the start. Eventually the other models are likely to be upgraded from Android 4.4 KitKat to Lollipop but the only question is when.  Which would you pick? 
If you have RM800 to spend, is the Mi 4i the best choice? From the comparison, the Mi 4i ticks all the right boxes except for its lack of microSD expansion. Share with us which would you go and why in the comments below."
Sirap Bandung,Galaxy Note 5 to be announced in September. Here’s what you need to know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/21/galaxy-note-5-to-be-announced-in-september-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"galaxy note 5,IFA 2015,note 5,Note 5 launch,project zen,project zero 2,rumour mill,S Pen,Samsung,samsung galaxy,samsung galaxy note 5","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Samsung",2015-05-21,"With Samsung’s big flagships already firmly cemented in the market it’s quite sensible to assume that the next big device they are working on is none other than the  Samsung Galaxy Note 5 . Rumours for an earlier Note 5 launch in July were quashed by Samsung Mobile’s head honcho J.K. Shin. The brand is still targeting for launch during IFA 2015 which is happening in September later this year, following a tradition of launching their Note devices at the trade show in Berlin. 
From what we already know,  the Galaxy Note 5 is expected to have a 5.7 inch display with either 2K or 4K resolution and the latest Exynos 7422 processor under the hood. The new unit is Samsung’s first all-in-one solution with an intergrated CPU, GPU, RAM, storage and modem combo all in one chip. But there are also rumours that the Note 5 could be running an Exynos 7430 processor as well. Also, Samsung has renamed Project Zen to Project Zero 2, which unlike the Galaxy Note 5 will not have S Pen support. This points towards perhaps a phablet version of the  Galaxy S6 edge  as opposed to a direct replacement for the Galaxy Note edge. The model number for Project Zero 2 has also been confirmed to be SM-G928, which shares a similar model numbering to the current Galaxy S6 and S6 edge which have vastly different specs than the Note 5. Project Zero 2 is said to have a smaller 5.4 or 5.5 inch dual-curved Super AMOLED display and will be sporting a Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor under the hood. This means Samsung is still giving Qualcomm a chance to be in one of their flagships and due to it being a lower spec CPU. As such the price gap between the Note 5 and Project Zero 2 could be much smaller. Currently the price difference between the normal screen models of the Note and the “edge” variant is about RM 500, so could we be seeing a similar price gap between the Note 5 and Project Zero 2? Both devices are expected to make an appearance during IFA 2015, so stay tuned for more updates. [ SOURCE ,  1 ]"
Sirap Bandung,Spotify isn’t just about music anymore. The streaming service now offers video too,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/21/spotify-isnt-just-about-music-anymore-the-streaming-service-now-offers-video-too/,"cool stuff,Spotify,spotify launch,Spotify Now,streaming,Video",Cool stuff,2015-05-21,"Spotify  is no longer just a music streaming service. In an event in New York, the company has unveiled a new version of Spotify that will offer new media content like videos, news and podcasts. That’s not all, the new Spotify will serve tailored playlists that will take into account what your music listening history as well as the activity that you’re doing at a point in time. New Media offerings By offering new media offerings like video, news and podcasts, it seems like Spotify wants to be an all-in-one media jukebox. Currently they’ve partnered up with a bunch of media companies that include; ABC, Adult Swim, BBC, Comedy Central, E!, ESPN, Fusion, Maker Studios, MTV, NBC, RadioLab, Slate, TED, TWiT, Vice News and WNYC. The video content will be served in clip form, taken out from the popular shows and programs of the media partners. For example, it could come in the form of a short news clip from the BBC, a short stand-up routine from Comedy Central or excerpts or even full talks from TED. Spotify will also be offering podcasts and talk based audio clips. One example is BBC Minute a round-the-clock news service that is basically 60 second conversations of shareable news updated every half hour. More relevant media suggestions All the new content and song library will be delivered in a new format of playlists that focus more on relevance rather than genres. Spotify will now take into account your age, location, media watching and listening history, then serve up a playlist that’ll be relevant to you for a particular time of a day. Spotify is calling it the Now experience. For example, if you fire-up Spotify during your lunch hour. Spotify’s Now page will like serve up playlist suggestions for your lunch time music or media. By taking into account your media playing history, music and media that are being played by people within your same demographic, mood as well as the time you’re accessing Spotify, a tailored list will be served to you to enjoy. Spotfiy Running There’s also a new treat for fitness fans as well and it comes in the form of Spotify’s Running feature. As the moniker goes, it’s targeted at those who are basically taking a good run and need some tunes for motivation. Spotfiy has partnered up with world renowned DJs and composers to come up with original compositions all tuned to a certain running tempo. These compositions together with your established taste of music will be served to you while running. It goes beyond just serving up the perfect music for your running though. By working together with sensors in your phone, as well as other relevant fitness accessories connected to it, the Running feature will determine the pace of your run and seamlessly transition music that will fit it, making sure that music played matches your every step. Spotify is already teaming up with Nike and will be offering the Running feature through the Nike+ app and will also partner up with RunKeeper later this year. The new Spotify features have already been launched in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Sweden. As for Malaysia, all we know from official sources is that it’ll be made available in the next few months, though no specific date has been set. It is also very likely that some of the content from the media partners announced in New York will not likely end up in our local version of Spotify and instead, content from local media partners will instead be made available."

The Xperia Z4 is basically an  incremental update  with a newer Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB RAM and the microUSB charging port is now exposed while maintaining its class leading waterproof capabilities.  While the Xperia Z4 was launched as a Japan only device, it looks like they are making it available in more markets as Sony is organising a press event in Hong Kong and Taiwan sometime next week. According to the press invite, it reveals that it would be a new flagship with emphasis on top camera, screen, sound, water and design all rolled into one. Since the Xperia Z4 isn’t really perceived as an all new model, it might be called simply as the  Xperia Z3+  outside of Japan. As Sony Mobile division is having some rough times, it makes more sense for them to focus on a single flagship per year cycle. The Xperia Z4/Z3+ is merely seen as a mid-life facelift and probably released at selected markets.  India apparently is  having an event too  on 26th May and we’ll find out soon enough what this new flagship is all about. If there’s one model that Sony should release, it would be the replacement of its  Xperia Z Ultra  phablet. [  SOURCE  ]"

If you’re looking to stand out, check out this classic looking brick phone that traveled all the way from the 80s. Introducing the KR999, a modern day feature phone in a 30 year old body which you can actually buy right now. Before you laugh it off as a joke, wait until you see the specs on this thing.  For starters, the KR999 comes with a colour LCD display that has a low 128×60 pixels and you do get some basic navigation keys along with a couple of buttons on top of the numeric pad. If you’re wondering where’s the camera, of course there’s none to preserve that old 80s retro appearance. You do get a couple of creature comforts such as FM radio, Bluetooth and even dual-SIMs supporting triple GSM bands 900MHz/1800MHz/1900MHz. There’s even a microSD slot where you can use it to store photos and videos, which you shouldn’t bother especially with that low resolution display. Probably the biggest surprise is the battery which could even put some of your power banks to shame. On the label it is written as 9,800mAh but for the price and size, we reckon it could be far less than what it claims to be. If you’re interested to get one, someone on  Mudah  is selling it for RM170 and it is available in either black or white. Imagine how cool you look when you place this down on the table at the Mamaks or Coffeeshops. Although there’s a Motorola label slapped onto the phone, we doubt the local distributor Brightstar would entertain your service request."

The  Xperia Z4 Tablet  and  M4 Aqua  were announced at  MWC 2015 . Not only these are the first batch of Xperias to run on Android Lollipop out of the box, but they are also their first waterproof devices that comes with an exposed microUSB port for hassle free charging. To recap on the specs, the Xperia Z4 Tablet is their flagship offering with a Quad HD 10.1″ IPS display doing 2560×1600 pixels resolution and it runs on Qualcomm’s top of the line 2GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM.

The Mi 4i  was announced  recently in India and it is Xiaomi’s first global phone, marking its seriousness of venturing beyond the Chinese market. Priced at RM749, the Mi 4i will be available on the Malaysia  Mi Store  from 28th May 2015 starting 12pm. The local telcos will only be getting the phone in June. It is currently one of the  best smart phones  you can get for under RM800 and it has dual-SIM with both slots supporting 4G LTE. The Mi 4i may look similar to its more premium  Mi 4  flagship but there are couple of notable differences. While the front 5″ Full HD display is similar, the Mi 4i gets a Sunlight Display tech which optimises the screen on the pixel level for better viewing in outdoor conditions. Instead of a metal frame, the Mi 4i gets a full polycarbonate body which currently is available only in White for Malaysia. Under the hood you get Qualcomm’s 2nd generation 64-bit Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Like the rest of Xiaomi’s flagships, there’s  no microSD slot  which is a bummer for those who need more storage expansion. To keep the Mi 4i running for long, it gets a 3,120mAh capacity battery, which is probably the largest in its class for a 5″ compact device. Despite having a larger capacity, the Mi 4i manages to be 12% thinner and 13% lighter than the 5″ Mi 4 that comes with a slightly smaller 3,080mAh battery. According to Xiaomi, the Mi 4i is rated to last 1.5 days with average use and it supports Quick Charge to juice it up quicker than usual. For taking pictures, it packs a 13MP f/2.0 camera from Sony/Samsung with 5 element lens. Meanwhile selfies are taken with a front facing 5MP f/1.8 camera with 5 element lens that has a 80 degree wide angle. Connectivity wise, the Mi 4i supports our local 4G LTE bands including 1800MHz and 2600MHz as well as 802.11ac WiFi. Everything you need to know about the Mi 4i right here:

According to sources, LG confirmed that a new flagship that “stands above the G series” is in the works, with predictions pointing towards the new device potentially being the successor to the  LG G Pro 2  to compete with Samsung’s  Galaxy Note  line of devices. This is part of the brand’s “dual flagship strategy” which it kicked off last year with the launch of the G Pro 2. However, the specs have yet to be finalized but LG says that the new phone will be pretty high-end. But the big question is how exactly is LG going to  one up the LG G4 ? [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

This time however it’s the guys over at  MyDrivers  who have done the deed instead of our usual suspects over at  iFixit . Also you might want to note that the LG G4 is the only new flagship out there to have a microSD slot and a removable battery. As it turns out, dismantling the phone is a piece of cake, with just the removal of the back panel, batteries and a few screws getting the phone to bear it’s innards.  The phone’s motherboard is laid out clearly and is a bundle of neatly stacked components with no excessively messy wiring, copper shielding or adhesive in the way. So if your LG G4 gets damaged and needs a fix, it should be pretty easy to get it repaired and it shouldn’t cost as much just to peel the device open though the components could still cost quite a bit.

Sirap Bandung,The R7 and R7 Plus are now official. Can OPPO make a thin phone with substance?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/20/the-r7-and-r7-plus-are-now-official-can-oppo-make-a-thin-phone-with-substance/,"Android,Oppo,Oppo R7,oppo R7 launch,OPPO R7 Malaysia,oppo r7 official,oppo R7 plus,OPPO R7 Plus Malaysia,smart phone","Mobile Devices,Oppo",2015-05-20,"With OPPO’s latest smartphone just launching today in China, the long awaited ultra-slim  OPPO R7  phones have finally made a landing, just in time for their 10th anniversary. This is seen as a successor to its current OPPO R5 which stands as their thinnest smart phone offering at only 4.85mm.  Keeping to the tradition of being super slim, the OPPO R7 is not the thinnest of the lot but at 6.3mm it is still quite remarkable for what it is packing on the inside. Like most new devices launched recently, the OPPO R7 doesn’t just come in one but two sizes with the addition of its R7 Plus model. Under the hood the device sports a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor mated to 3GB RAM as well as 16GB expandable storage. The device will have 4G connectivity and a non-removable 2,320mAh battery. The display is a 5 inch Full HD 1080p AMOLED display with 2.5D glass with smoothed out edges much like what is on the iPhone 6. Both phones will be sporting ColourOS 2.1 that’s still based on Android 4.4 KitKat, which is very dated for new device in this day and age. Despite that, OPPO claims that the new enhanced version offers faster boot time and app loading.  The device has a 8 megapixel front snapper with a wide 84-degree viewing angle as well as a  13 megapixel rear camera  sporting a ISOCELL CMOS sensor paired with a Schneider-Kreuznach designed lens. OPPO claims that the camera is capable of Phase Detection Auto Focus in 0.1 seconds and initiates 30% faster than other devices, making it easy to capture fast moving subjects. It is also equipped with VOOC Flash charging that allows you to charge from 0 to 75% in just 30 minutes and a mere 5 minutes charge is enough to provide two hours of talktime. The OPPO R7 is a dual-SIM device but if you need to expand more storage, the 2nd slot can be used for microSD.  As for the OPPO R7 Plus it also has 3GB RAM but it gets a larger 32GB storage on-board. Being a bigger device, is gets a huge 4,100mAh battery with VOOC charging as well. The display will be a 6 inch Full HD 1080p AMOLED display and it uses a 4 colour RGBW 13MP camera much like the Huawei P8 that’s assisted with dual LED flash. According to OPPO, the the 4 colour set up would improve picture brightness while reducing noise. The R7 Plus is also home to a fingerprint scanner that’s located at the back. With the extra bulk, the R7 Plus is thicker at 7.75mm and it weighs 203 grams. Strangely, the OPPO R7 Plus is listed to run on ColorOS 2.1 with Android 5.1. Another difference between the 2 models is that the R7 has capacitive front buttons while the R7 Plus opts for on-screen buttons instead. The 5″ OPPO R7 will be retailing for 2499 CNY (about RM 1457) while the 6″ OPPO R7 Plus at 2999 CNY (about RM 1749).

Just days before the big reveal, OPPO has officially released more info on its cameras.  Like most Android manufacturers, OPPO has always relied on Sony cameras for its high end smart phones. For the R7, they have turned to Samsung for what they claimed to be a much superior camera experience. OPPO is fitting a main 13MP rear camera on the R7 that uses ISOCELL CMOS sensor for faster, more accurate and stable shots. If you’re wondering where have you heard about ISOCELL, this is the same Samsung camera technology that was  used on the Galaxy S5 . Some of the key advantages include less noise from cross talk with fine barriers between each pixels and a better dynamic range for greater details.  Other enhancements for better photography include a dual-drive Hybrid Focus system and an Anti-Shake optimisation. OPPO added that its R7 main camera could focus as quick as 0.1 seconds and it initiates 30% faster than other devices. To avoid missing a clear shot, the Anti-Shake optimisation starts taking a burst of multiple shots before you press the shutter and it continues to take more even after you released the button. After that, it will pick the best photo that is perceived to be the clearest from the batch.  In addition, the 13MP ISOCELL camera is also paired with Schneider-Kreuznach designed lens, a renowned German optical manufacturer. Meanwhile at the front, it gets a higher resolution 8MP shooter for clearer and detailed selfies.  On the software side, the OPPO R7 gets a Pure Image 2.0+ image processor where it gets extra features such as taking higher resolution photos up to 50MP, Super Macro and much more. For Selfie lovers, there’s a beautify mode which applies make up touches instantly without breaking a sweat. How does this translate to real life performance? We have to wait until we get a unit to find out. The OPPO R7 is part of their ultra-thin range of smart phones and it will be launched with multiple  size variants . More details to be announced officially this coming Wednesday."
Sirap Bandung,Here’s how to spot a fake OPPO N3,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/19/heres-how-to-spot-a-fake-oppo-n3/,"Android,counterfeit,fake,imitation smartphones,Oppo N3,oppo n3 fake,oppo n3 imitation,smartphone,Video","Android,Industry in General,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-05-19,"Fake phones aren’t a new thing around our parts, with fake  flagships  circulating the market and even  budget phones  having no escape from getting counterfeited. Earlier this year it was discovered that there were  counterfeit OPPO phones  floating around the market, with the brand themselves warning against buying the phones from non-legitimate sources. Now they’ve announced that they are in the process of cracking down on counterfeiters selling the cheaply priced clones and have published a video showing how to spot a fake OPPO N3. So far over 744 cases so far have been reported with fake phones ending up at OPPO’s service centers by the droves showing just how bad it has gotten. They have also put together a handy video detailing on how to spot a fake OPPO N3 versus the real deal side by side: So here are four ways to spot a fake OPPO N3. 1. Display The differences in display from the original article and the fake are quite obvious, with the genuine 5.5 inch OPPO N3 using an IPS LCD display at 16M colours and 1080 x 1920 pixels and Colour OS 2.0 is sharp and crisp while the clone’s display is oddly tinted and has a lower resolution. 2. Rotating camera The clone OPPO N3 does not have a motorised rotating lens that can be activated via onscreen gestures (pictured at the left) and has to be rotated manually while the genuine N3 can be automatically manipulated and has a 16 megapixel Schneider Kreuznach certified camera. The clone also only has a 5 megapixel rear camera and is missing the O-Touch key. 3. Specs On top of coming in a wrong sized box and sub par accessories, the genuine N3 (as pictured on the right) will have a VOOC Flash Charge and USB, quality earbuds, O-Click 2.0 Bluetooth remote as well as a fingerprint scanner on the back. 4. Battery, circuit board and connectivity In addition to the OPPO N3 using an non-removable battery, the inside of the fake device is very different from that of the actual article. The genuine N3 also uses a micro coaxial cable and double-sided printed circuit board (PCB) whereas the fake product as an unregistered and possibly dangerous battery as well as an easy to bend flexible printed circuit (FPC). You will also find single sided PCB with stickers in the fake holding the internals like it has been taped together. This is particularly dangerous because the parts are likely to have malfunctions and heating problems that could put you at risk due to their toxic nature or at very worse, literally explode. OPPO strongly recommends that you only buy their phones from their official retailers and partners to avoid injury or unknowingly buying fake products. UPDATE : OPPO Malaysia has announced an  online IMEI checker  to find out if a device is an original unit."

The tablets in question are very likely to be the ZenPad 7 and the ZenPad 8, with the ZenPad 7 coming in two size options.

But after a deluge of negative feedback about their paltry trade in program, they’ve revised the pricing to be a little bit more reasonable. Now you can get up to a RM 1,200 rebate for your new Galaxy S6 or S6 edge should you decide to trade in your phone, with the rebates being bumped up from by about RM 200 extra a piece. Much better than getting an RM 100 rebate for an iPhone 4. You can view the revamped value list below. Still, for the vast majority of the phones it’s still not entirely feasible to trade them in for rebates due to being valued pretty low for relatively new phones like the Sony Xperia Z3 and the Galaxy Note 4, but at least you can get more out of them now. But for the older phones, getting that extra RM 200 makes more difference than just letting it languish in a drawer somewhere. The trade-up program is happening from now until 31st May.

Similar to the iOS, the Watch OS is still quite basic for it’s first iteration. For example when the iPhone was initially launched it couldn’t even copy and paste which was a point of mockery for the device’s rivals, plus it didn’t even have an AppStore till iOS 2.0 was released. But this is set to change as a new software update will be teaching the Watch a bunch of new tricks, like Sleep Tracking and Find my Watch. While the security is already pretty decent, it’s getting further bumped up with the Find my Watch feature and possibly a proximity alert for your iPhone should the Watch get out of range. Among the updates is a new health features that allows the hardware to measure your Blood Oxygen Saturation but the function is disabled for the time being. All of the new updates are great but we do hope they could do something about the battery life not being capable of going past a full day. Another possibility is Apple opening up widgets to 3rd party app developers and who knows, they allow custom watch face designs that could be sold on the AppStore.

There isn’t much more information at the moment, like pricing whether or not it would be a Japan exclusive phone like the  Xperia Z4. [ VIA] [ SOURCE ]"

There is however a third model in the form of the  P8 Lite  that features mid-spec internals and obviously a lower price price tag. While it wasn’t announced, the device has gone on sale quietly in some markets in Europe. In Hungary, a retailer is selling the P8 Lite for 79,999 Hungarian Forint which is about RM1,059. Meanwhile in Germany, the device is available for pre-orders at 249 Euro which is quite close at RM1,011. In terms of specs,  early details  of the P8 Lite points to a 5″ HD 720p display, a 1.2GHz Octa-Core Kirin 620 processor, 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage. It also gets a 13MP rear and 5MP cameras, along with a 2,200mAh capacity battery. The processor is similar to the Honor 4X but with a tiny 2,200mAh battery, you probably might need to charge it more regularly. The P8 Lite also runs on Android 5.0 like its P8 siblings and it runs on their proprietary Emotion UI 3.1 on top. Huawei will be having its  regional P8 launch  in early June at Singapore. We are definitely going to see the  P8  and the  P8 Max  and they probably would release the P8 Lite for our market as well."

If you’re looking for the cheapest smart phone with Lollipop, Acer has an entry level smart phone that runs with it below RM300. The trio of new smartphones are none other than the Acer Liquid Z220, Z520 along with the higher end Liquid Jade Z. The Acer Liquid Jade Z is the successor of the original  Liquid Jade S , and is the sleekest of the lot at just 7.9mm thin and weighs just 110 grams. While it looks very similar to it’s predecessor the phone will instead be featuring an updated 64-bit quad-core MediaTek processor mated to 2GB RAM and 16GB expandable memory up to 32GB. The display features a 5 inch IPS display at 1280 x 720 resolution with Zero Air Gap technology.

Originally announced  at MWC 2015, the card comes in  an absolutely huge 200GB, the new SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Premium Edition card is literally the highest capacity card currently available in the market. The card can hold up to 20 hours of Full HD video or 1200 photos and is capable of 90MB/s transfer speeds. SanDisk has won multiple awards thanks to this card, and it’s apparently also water proof, shock proof, temperature, magnet and X-ray proof, if you happen to need to swap out your card while in an undersea volcano somewhere.

Apart from having the best spec in each iteration, most power users would appreciate its removable battery and the option of adding a microSD if needed. This however changed when they introduced its  Galaxy S6  and  S6 edge . Opting for premium build quality and aesthetics, the new Samsung flagship has dropped most of its expansion options, which is a let down for certain die hard fans.  Coming from the neighbouring camp in South Korea, the  LG G4  has emerged and it seems to be a formidable rival for Samsung. Does it stand a chance against the Galaxy S6? Read on to find out.  Recently we managed to try out the new G4 in its Metal Grey body. The back which undoubtedly is plastic is laden with subtle polygon patterns underneath a metallic looking surface. In the hands, it reminds us of the  Zenfone 2  series and overall we like the look and feel of it. True to LG’s own tradition, it gets a rear mounted rocker button that sits underneath its camera. For those who want to stand out with something more upmarket, there’s also a leather back variant which is made out of Genuine Leather with striking stitching that runs down in the middle.  At the front, it gets a similar 5.5″ Quad HD display as its former  LG G3 . However it is improved with greater colour range and brightness with its IPS Quantum Display. In comparison with the Galaxy S6, it is equally as sharp and colour wise it looks more natural without the exaggerated saturation that’s apparent with Super AMOLED displays. The front of the G4 does arc slightly but it isn’t as obvious as its curvy G Flex 2. Under the hood, it runs on a Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM along with 32GB of storage. While it isn’t the top ranging Snapdragon 810 that’s powering the  LG G Flex 2 , the LG G4 feels rather smooth. Sure it won’t be beating the Galaxy S6 phenomenal benchmark scores but it feels more than capable to handle anything you throw at it. We kinda like the flat interface of LG’s UX 4.0 that runs on top of a newer Android 5.1 Lollipop. Compared to Samsung’s TouchWiz, LG’s UX 4.0 feels lighter and it is a refreshing take on Android’s pure Material Design. As usual, you get the LG gesture tricks like Knock Code, where you can unlock your device with a preset knocking patterns. This allows you to wake the device without having the reach for its buttons, and they had to do this since the buttons are all placed at the back.   Probably one of the killer features is the camera. While it sports a similar 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabiliser, the LG G4 edges over the Galaxy S6 with a faster f/1.8 lens. This allows more light which on paper is a better shooter in low light conditions. For greater colour accuracy, there’s even a Colour Spectrum sensor that’s located right underneath its flash light. The Galaxy S6 has incredible camera and LG seems to have taken it up a notch by offering heaps of manual controls including focus and even shutter speed. For selfie fans, the front gets a higher 8MP camera that even has its own soft flash. To capture the perfect selfie, it could take several snaps of you doing different poses in a sequence and then pick the best shot after that. Overall the camera is snappy and the focus is also immediate with multi-point selection on-screen like a dSLR.  If you’re looking for a flagship, it has to have top notch performance, an incredible camera and the looks to stand out. In that respect, the LG G4 has the means to give the Galaxy S6 some serious challenge. Not forgetting of course is the ability to add even the largest 200GB microSD card and a user replaceable 3,000mAh battery, which are the two of the biggest things most power users would want in a high-end device.  It is just a pity that LG Malaysia isn’t showing any indication of offering the LG G4 in Malaysia. In  Singapore , the LG G4 is priced at $928 (about RM2,518) for the Metallic model and $998 (about RM2708) for the Leather version. If you want to get one in Malaysia, you’ll have to fork out  RM3,800  for an imported unit."

What if you had a GoPro enabled drone that could pilot itself? This is the Lily, the only drone with a built-in camera that you can throw up into the air and have it follow you to capture life’s greatest adventure.  The Lily can fly at 25 miles per hour and shoot 1080p video or 720p at up to 120 fps while keeping it’s eyes on you. It can also shoot 12 megapixel still shots and 360 degree panoramas. Just toss it into the air for the ultimate selfie. The drone will even detect when you’re kicking some sick moves and automatically goes into slow mo mode. The Lily does this by following a small tracker you wear on your wrist (or anywhere else on the target) and with this you issue some simple commands for it work. The tracker doesn’t work as a traditional remote control however, and there’s no way for you to pilot it manually, but it more than makes up for it with it’s own piloting skills. So in that sense, it’s more of a flying camera than an actual honest-to-goodness drone. The device has a range of a hundred feet, a 20 minute battery life on a single charge and is totally waterproof. You can even watch footage live on your phone using their mobile app. Unfortunately, it’s not cheap and it carries a $499 (about RM 1783) price tag if you pre-order it and $999 (about RM 3570) on retail if you decide to try snagging one for yourself.

soyacincau,No more fumbling over coins. Prepaid Reloads will be exempted from GST,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/13/no-more-fumbling-over-coins-prepaid-reloads-will-be-zero-rated/,"gst,gst malaysia,GST Top Up,Malaysia Prepaid,Malaysia Prepaid Tax,prepaid,Prepaid Reload,Prepaid Reload GST,Prepaid Top up GST,Sales Tax","Industry in General,Players on the Field",2015-05-13,"When  GST  came into effect on 1st April, Malaysian consumers were up in arms over the extra 6% charge on prepaid reloads. There was  mass confusion  as Deputy Finance Minister Ahmad Maslan retorted that there shouldn’t be any price increase. The fact is prepaid services should have been  taxed  with service charge which the telcos have been absorbing all these while. There’s no running away from GST as even postpaid users have always been paying the extra 6% tax on their monthly bills. After taking charge of the prepaid reload issue, Communications and Multimedia Minister, Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek has finally announced a solution which would hopefully put the matter to rest. The minister announced that all prepaid reloads will not be imposed with GST. So if you buy a RM10 top up, you’ll get RM10 value with no extra charge upon purchase. However that doesn’t mean prepaid is free from GST. Instead the 6% tax will be charged only upon usage. Essentially this is similar to buying shopping vouchers at the supermarkets and you’ll only be charged GST upon purchase. You can’t avoid GST but this implementation is actually fairer to consumers. Currently consumers are paying GST upfront even before the service is being used. Furthermore not all mobile usage would attract GST charges, for example usage overseas for roaming internet and calls are actually exempted from GST. In the current system, prepaid users would have already paid GST when they roam as the 6% tax was already paid upfront regardless of what you plan to do with your credit.  Nope, there’s no refund as  All GST are paid the moment you top up.  UPDATE : For GST on roaming using prepaid,  Digi ,  Maxis  and  Xpax  mentions that GST will be refunded. In Digi’s FAQ it states that users will be notified of the refund the next day while Xpax shall rebate back at the end of the day in Malaysian time. Whereas for postpaid users, data or voice calls during roaming would be GST exempted and you only pay GST for taxable usage when you receive your bill. The only impact is that your mobile rates would increase by 6%. So a typical 10sen/minute would be charged at 10.6sen/minute and RM10 service add-on for data would cost RM10.60. At least it is fair that you only pay upon consuming your credit.  However the biggest question is whether or not the telcos would round up the extra 6% charge. Because if they do, you’ll end up with less credit in the long run (e.g. Being charged 11 sen instead of 10.6 sen). Currently our local banks are charging GST for its services and they round up the 10 sen Interbank GIRO charges to 11 sen inclusive of GST. The ministry has given telcos 6 months to comply with the latest change and they urge them to lower down their rates to minimise the impact of the cost increase. Currently some prepaid players have taken some steps such as giving free calls or credit. One of the notable initiatives we’ve seen so far is from  TuneTalk  where they give free RM10 credit if you top up RM30 and free RM20 if you top up RM50. What do you guys think? Will this end the GST prepaid debacle once and for all? [  SOURCE  ]"

The best part is, if you happen to crash you can just rewind and get back on the ball. Graphics are quite minimalist but up to date with a snazzy soundtrack to boot. It also looks like there will be a healthy mix of old and new features, with missions you can complete in the game as well as visual modes that imitate Snake from past and present, so if you fancy playing Snake on a Cathode Tube screen or exactly the way it was on the Nokia 6110 you can do just that.

The phone sports pretty much the same specs as leaked prior, with a 5.2 inch Super AMOLED display at 1080p with 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass and a metal frame. The X5Pro is also pretty thin at 6.44 mm. Under the hood is an 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615 chipset mated to 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage that can be expanded via microSD. The phone will be running on Vivo’s Funtouch 2.1 OS that’s based on Android 5.0 Lollipop as well as dual-SIM LTE support and a 2,300 mAh battery. The camera’s rear plays home to a 13 megapixel camera with f/2.2 aperture for wider shots as well as an LED flash. The front camera on the other hand is a 8 megapixel snapper that has an image interpolation tech that supposedly allows you to capture images all the way up to 32 megapixels in quality, similar to how  OPPO  pulls off 50 megapixels with a 13 megapixel camera. It is also where the  high tech  iris scanner  security scanner with eye-recognition is placed. We don’t know how well either one would work till we get our hands on one.   The earlier leaked specs stated that the phone would be sporting a  4150 mAh battery  but it’s possible that it could be a variant that has yet to be announced. Price and availability for the phone is still up in the air at this point, but the phone is expected to hit the market for around $440 which is about RM 1578. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

The must have power accessory was spotted in their latest  product guide . If the popular Xiaomi Mi Powerbanks are too mainstream for your taste, the ZenPower is probably the closest alternative with 11 safety layers and a similar aluminium body that comes in a compact credit card-like size.  According to the listing, we are getting the smaller  9,600mAh unit  instead of the larger  10,050mAh ZenPower  that we saw in Jakarta.  Priced at RM69, it still can’t beat Xiaomi’s extremely low priced power banks that costs RM49 for 10,000mAh and RM79 for its mammoth 16,000mAh version. However it is still cheap compared to most mainstream power banks in the market. In Indonesia, the  ZenPower 10,050mAh  is priced at 269,000 Rupiah, which is about RM75. The ZenPower also has the advantage of being lighter (at only 215g) and it pushes a higher 2.4Amp which charges faster than the typical 2.1Amp output from most powerbanks. If our assumption of its product listing is correct, ASUS Malaysia could be bringing multiple colours such as Gold, Black, Blue and Pink in addition to the standard silver colour body. You can check out the  ASUS ZenPower announcement post  from our Jakarta Zenfone 2 launch coverage. Thanks  @KevinNgTK  for the tip!"
soyacincau,The HTC Butterfly 3 is the better One but there’s only one small problem,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/18/the-htc-butterfly-3-is-the-better-one-but-theres-only-one-small-problem/,"HTC,HTC Butterfly 3,HTC Butterfly 3 Japan,HTC Butterfly 3 Specs,HTC J Butterfly,Japan,smart phone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-05-18,"HTC has been releasing one too many devices starting with its  One M9  flagship followed by its bigger  One M9+  and  One E9+  models. The One M9 boasts a high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor while the One M9+ gets a higher Quad HD resolution display but the compromise is it runs on a MediaTek processor underneath. If you still prefer HTC and if you’re looking for the ultimate device, the new  Butterfly 3  could be the One you’re looking for. It gets a similar 5.2″ Quad HD Super LCD3 display, an Octa-Core 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB RAM and a decent 32GB of storage that you can expand with microSD. Like the current  Butterfly 2 , there’s also water and dust resistance rated at IP55/IP57. All sounds good but there’s one disadvantage compared to the current One models.   With a high end display and processor, you would expect HTC to power this up with a larger battery but instead, it gets just a 2,700mAh capacity unit. As comparison, the HTC One M9 and One M9+ gets a larger 2,840mAh. This is quite surprising since the Butterfly series that targets the lifestyle segment is expected to get more specs for your buck. For example the Butterfly 2 had a 2,700mAh unit versus the former One M8 flagship’s 2,600mAh capacity.  It is 2015 and high-end 5″ smart phones should come with at least 3,000mAh capacity batteries for an all-day usage. Even with Samsung’s optimised display, processor and storage, we only managed to get about 11-14 hours of average use per charge on the Galaxy S6 edge (2,600mAh battery). For taking pictures, HTC is throwing everything they’ve got with a main 20.2MP Duo Camera set up similar to the One M9+. Selfie lovers would be in for a treat, as there’s a front shooter with higher 13MP unit. At the front, you also get HTC’s famed Boom Sound stereo speakers enhanced with Dolby Audio and out of the box, it runs on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop. Overall, the Butterfly 3, which is called as the J Butterfly in Japan weighs 162 grams with a thickness of 10.1mm. That’s slightly lighter by a mere 6 grams than the metal clad One M9+.  There are 3 colour options available – Red, White and Indigo Blue which comes with a glossy polycarbonate back. At the moment it is released only in Japan and it is expected to be made available internationally in the months to come.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Packing a 5″ Full HD display, an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, 13MP main camera and a large 3,120mAh battery, this is  the most advanced smart phone you can get  for less than RM800.  For the naysayers that still doubt on its imminent release, the Mi 4i is still on track to hit our shores this month. We’ve seen it  passed certification  under SIRIM and the latest update is that Xiaomi Malaysia will be making an announcement very soon. In a reply to a fan on  Instagram , Xiaomi mentions that they will announce the Mi 4i sometime next week. Assuming it is about an upcoming flash sale, this might take place around the last week of May. At the moment, the Mi 4i is already on sale in India since 30th April and most recently they have started pushing the device in Hong Kong and Singapore on 12th May.  The Mi 4i in Malaysia should be priced below RM800 considering the current markets are pricing it as follows: Compared with the  Mi 4  that was launched earlier, the Mi 4i is seen as a budget version with the use of polycarbonate body instead of having a more upmarket metal frame. Although the Mi 4 is having a similar 5″ Full HD display, it gets a higher spec 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM on either 16GB or 64GB storage. For taking pictures, it gets a main 13MP f/1.8 camera while selfies are taken with a higher resolution 8MP front shooter.  Initially Xiaomi refrained from bringing the Mi 4 in due to lack of wider 4G LTE band support, particularly 2600MHz that’s mostly used in Malaysia. Surprisingly they had  introduced the Mi 4 recently  in Malaysia. However it was the 3G only model and sold through a single distribution channel in the northern states of Malaysia.  For less than RM800, it is hard to think of anything better that comes with a 5″ Full HD display, an all day battery and equipped with dual-SIMs supporting 4G LTE. Probably the only gripe is the  lack of the microSD slot  which they claim to have intentionally removed for better user experience. Want to learn more about the Mi 4i? Check out our coverage below:

Following its new  super slim 5,000mAh  model, its mid-range  10,400mAh  power bank has gone on a diet and now they have introduced a 10,000mAh version that’s both smaller and lighter. Weighing at 207 grams, it is 43 grams lighter and they have reduced its width by 20% to just 60.4mm. Thickness wise shouldn’t be much of a difference as the new 10,000mAh is 22mm thick, which is slightly more than its predecessor at 21.6mm. This is quite remarkable as they have managed to pack about the same capacity as before.  You also get the same build quality with a metal clad body and it has the same charging chips from Texas Instruments and US Power Systems for greater peace of mind. In terms of output, it still pushes the same 2.1Amps from a single USB port as before. To check for its status, it also retains the single power/check button with its 4 LED status lights. Another noticable difference is the plcement of its microUSB input and full size USB port which is now placed in the middle, similar to its previous 5,200mAh power bank.  In China it is priced at 69 CNY which is about RM40. For more info, you can check out Xiaomi’s  Mi 10,000mAh Power Bank  product page. [  SOURCE   2 ,  VIA  ]"

soyacincau,Here’s a clearer look of OPPO’s ultra-thin R7 and R7 Plus,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/13/heres-a-clearer-look-of-oppos-ultra-thin-r7-and-r7-plus/,"Android,Oppo,Oppo R7,oppo R7 plus,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Oppo",2015-05-13,"OPPO’s next big thing will be its OPPO R7 which would come in 2 different sizes. We’ve seen the  leaked commercial  and now we get a clearer look from what appears to be its official render. The R series is usually associated with its ultra-thin series and before this, their  OPPO R5  was the thinnest smart phone in the world at only 4.85mm thick. For the next version, the R7 will come in 2 sizes – the standard R7 that’s likely to be a 5 incher and a bigger R7 Plus model which could carry at least 5.5″ display. From the design it looks pretty slender and it shares a metal frame surrounding the device. Between the two models, the OPPO R7 Plus seems to be an on-screen button as it gets a large OPPO branding right below the display. Over at the back, it also carries what seems to be a fingerprint scanner, dual-tone LED flash and a black colour element which could be an infrared LED for camera focus. Meanwhile the standard R7 retains a classic look with a clean looking back. Looking at the two models side by side, the placement of the volume rockers and power button are different between the two, with the power button placed on the right for the R7 Plus, while the standard R7 is having it on the left. Details of the rest of the device is quite scarce and we are hoping that they would include a battery that could last full day on a single charge. As usual, you can expect OPPO to include its famed VOOC rapid charge that juices up from 0-75% in 30 minutes.  The OPPO R7 is expected to be revealed on 20th May. If you’re looking for top end specs and performance, we would have to wait for its Find 9, which is the likely successor of its current  Find 7 . [  SOURCE  ]"

The previous Moto X had a 13 megapixel rear camera as well as a 2 megapixel front camera, so the new Moto X should have a significant upgrade with a 16 megapixel camera with Clear Pixel and likely a 5 megapixel front snapper for selfies. The specs however are still speculation till Motorola announces otherwise, but they are likely to announce the new phone in September, if it follows the same timing as it did with the previous Moto X.

By the looks of it, the Tab S2 will be sporting a metal rim as well as a physical home button as well as a power button and a volume rocker on top of a microSD and SIM card slot. The home button could possibly be a fingerprint scanner as well. Rumoured specs  for the device include a super AMOLED 2048 x 1536 display, 64-bit Exynos processor, 3GB RAM and 32GB storage with Android 5.0 out of the box. The tablet is also expected to have a 8 megapixel rear camera with a 2.1 megapixel front shooter and Cat.6 LTE support. @Onleaks also reports that the tablet may not be as skinny as originally thought, as it’s rumoured to be around 5.8 to 5.9 mm at it’s thickest point when previously it was speculated that the 8 inch model of the Tab S2 would be around 5.4 to 5.5mm thick. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is more or less expected to make it’s debut in June and should come in Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi and 3G flavours. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"
Sirap Bandung,"Lenovo A7000 : Average phone, loud speakers",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/12/lenovo-a7000-4g-lte-dual-sim-malaysia-review/,,,2015-05-12,"UPDATE:  The Lenovo A7000 received a firmware update very recently and the new test scores reflect that. The  Lenovo A7000  is their latest addition in the mid-range smartphone segment that has been highly competitive with the likes of the Redmi Note and the Honor 4X. With the addition of Dolby Atmos tech and speakers, Lenovo hopes that the A7000 would stand out from the crowd. Quite literally the first phone to sport Dolby Atmos which is more commonly seen in cinemas, the  Lenovo A7000  is only the first in a line of Lenovo products to be sporting the technology. You can expect more Dolby Atmos enhanced devices with their upcoming Lenovo Tab 2 A8 and A10. Is this a compelling choice when it comes to cheap and good phablets with 4G LTE? This is our review of the Lenovo A7000. In terms of specs, the Lenovo A7000 has a 5.5 inch IPS HD display at 1280 x 720, alongside a 1.5GHZ octa-core MediaTek MT6752m processor that has been mated to 2GB RAM and a removable 2,900 mAh battery. The phone comes with just 8GB internal storage but it’s expandable up to 32GB via a microSD slot. For those who are particular about software, it runs on Android 5.0 with its own VIBE UI on top. Connectivity is all covered as the A7000 is dual-SIM ready with LTE connectivity, which is becoming mainstream for midrangers. Out of the box, the Lenovo A7000 is a pretty spartan package, with the contents only being a microUSB cable and charger plug as well as a pair of very basic earphones. Strangely enough Lenovo didn’t include a OTG cable that allows you to charge other devices with the phone, despite the A7000’s inherent ability to act as a powerbank."

The Lenovo A7000 has a 1.5GHz octa-core MediaTek processor under the hood, alongside 2GB RAM and 8GB internal extandable storage with a microSD slot. Being a phablet device, it gets a 5.5 inch IPS HD display at 720p as well as a 8 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front shooter. The Lenovo A7000 will also be playing home to a 2,900mAh removable battery and it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. The phone also can be used as a power bank to charge other devices. Connectivity wise, it covers all bases with 4G LTE connectivity up to 150Mbps (Cat. 4) as well as dual-SIM slots. Of course the main attraction for the Lenovo A7000 is the inclusion of Dolby Atmos, which marks the phone as the first of its kind. Very much geared towards those looking for an extra kick while they enjoy their movies on the go, Lenovo is also planning on releasing two tablets in the future to also have Dolby Atmos under the hood. The phone comes in either Pearl White or Onyx Black and it is priced at RM699 for the Malaysian market. During today’s event, Lenovo has also announced Lazada as their exclusive partner in South East Asia including Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

The Oppo R7 is home to 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615 CPU mated to 3GB RAM with 16GB storage. It also sports a 5 inch Full HD screen with a pixel densityof 441ppi, as well as a 20.7 megapixel camera and a 2320mAh battery. By the looks of things, the Oppo R7 will be making it’s debut with it’s larger sibling the Oppo R7 Plus, which features the same body, 2.5D glass and near edge-to-edge screen. The device will also have on-screen keys, a feature that has never been on any Oppo smartphone to date and it comes with a fingerprint reader on it’s rear, similar to that of the  Huawei Ascend P7 Max  and the  HTC One Max  which isn’t a very convenient placement. Both phones will support VOOC rapid charging, with the second ad focusing explicitly on the charging aspect of the R7 series phones, which will grant users two hours of battery life for a five minute charge. The phones are expected to be launched on the  20th of May  which is not too far off, so hopefully we will have the full pricing for both models as well as the premium variant soon.

After revealing a  side shot  of the new slate, serial leakster  @onleaks  has spilled more product renders for our viewing pleasure. If you’re expecting something similar to the  Galaxy S6 , you might be in for a disappointment as the renders point towards a  Galaxy A  series like design.    The tablet you’re seeing here is the 9.7″ version which is likely to come with a 4:3 display aspect ratio that pushes 2048 x 1536 resolution. This is essentially the same as the full sized iPad with Retina Display. On the right, there’s a normal power/volume rocker buttons, and further down there are 2 slots visible that’s likely to house a SIM and microSD slot. The back has a matte looking surface and there’s a camera at the top which surprisingly lacked an LED flash which is present in the  current Tab S . Design wise, it doesn’t seem to be anything out of the ordinary except for the unique slanting edges at the back. Under the hood, the Galaxy Tab S2 is said to be running on a 64-bit Octa-Core Exynos processor with 3GB of RAM and it should come with at least 32GB of storage on-board. In terms of thickness, it is expected to be between 5.5mm and 5.9mm.  According to the source, he stresses that these are not official press images but they are renders based on their informants that are close to the project. It has been a while since we saw a new flagship tablet and probably the best to date is the  Nexus 9 . With Android phones getting bigger with the rise of phablets, are tablets still relevant to you?

Now Swype for Android is taking its speed input capabilities up a level with a new 2 word prediction. So if you type “How”, it will suggest “are you” or “are things” and it learns to pick up more words, the more you use it. This comes with the latest Swipe 1.9 and there are other new features as well. The prediction now works with symbols and numbers, so if you can type on the keyboard based on its secondary value (that’s usually typed with a long press) and it will turn up as a suggestion. This saves time switching to symbol/number view or individually long pressing the secondary keys.

Want to own the  Galaxy S6  or  S6 edge  but don’t know what to do with your current phone? To make it easier for you to make the switch, Samsung has announced a trade-up program in partnership with Brightstar Distribution. You can get up to RM1,000 off on your Galaxy S6 purchase depending on your current phone’s valuation at  participating Samsung Outlets . Of course, your existing device must be in working condition with no visible damage to the screen, buttons and body.  So how much can your phone fetch? According to the  trade-in list  based on Brightstar’s valuation, the value is pretty low even for flagship devices that were announced late last year. The full list as follows: If you’re looking to dispose your phone, you would be better off selling it to a friend, relative or advertising it on some online classified sites. The Galaxy Note 4 and Sony Xperia Z3 are valued too low despite being a flagship just 6 months ago. Even the RM75-RM100 valuation for older models like the Galaxy S II and iPhone 4 is close to nothing that you are better off keeping them yourself. Perhaps this could be something to consider only if you don’t have time to look for a potential buyer.  The trade-up program is happening from now until 31st May.

It will also be running on Tizen and very likely one of Samsung’s Exynos chips as well. Unfortunately, Samsung has never really stated when it will launch the Gear A, but since Samsung has a habit of launching it’s smartwatches alongside flagship devices there’s a fairly high chance it will either make it’s debut with the Note 5 or show up sometime later this year, as sources claim that the delays are for the sake of ensuring the product is not rushed in development.

Those days are long behind us, the times when you were stuck with whatever software was on your feature phone, and almost always there would be Snake. Now the game is making a comeback for touchscreen phones thanks to Nokia engineer Taneli Armanto who was originally responsible for putting the game on the Nokia 6110 and developer Rumilus Design for a fresh take on good ol’ Snake. The game has been aptly named “Snake Rewind” both as a revisiting to classic Snake as well as one of the game’s mechanics that lets you “rewind” if you happen to Game Over. Graphics are quite minimalistic but sports a lot of special effects that are more commonplace in today’s games. It also looks like there will be a healthy mix of old and new features, with missions you can complete in the game as well as visual modes that imitate Snake from past and present, so if you fancy playing Snake on a Cathode Tube screen or exactly the way it was on the Nokia 6110 you can do so.can do just that.

Ahead of its global announcement, the OPPO R7 has just passed our Malaysian SIRIM certification with the model R7f. From the little certification details, the R7 has dual-SIM slots and it will support 4G LTE in both 1800MHz and 2600MHz.  Just to recap what OPPO has revealed so far, the R7 appears to be similar with the current R5 but it gets a couple of new additions. At the front, there’s a physical home button which is probably the first for OPPO. There’s a possibility that the home button could double up as a one touch fingerprint scanner for easier unlocking.  For the front, it gets a 2.5D screen which has a slight rounded edges at the sides that’s similar to the iPhone 6 and Galaxy Note 4. Being an R series, you can expect this to be super slim but it may not be as thin as their current R5. If they are plan to push this as a flagship, OPPO should considering putting a larger battery capacity into this one. As usual, you can expect OPPO’s VOOC rapid charging technology which does 0-75% in just 30 minutes.  With the device being certification in our local SIRIM database, it looks like Malaysia would be among the first wave countries to receive it after its global announcement. The OPPO R7 is said to be  launching  in May. OPPO R7 SIRIM Certification"

The  Galaxy S4  is more than 2 years old but Samsung is still pushing the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop update onto the old flagship. In Malaysia, users using the 3G version (GT-i9500) can start downloading the software update which is about 1.1GB in size. This carries the Android version number 5.0.1. It is advisable to update your device via WiFi and to perform a backup of your files before proceeding with the update. If you haven’t received any notifications yet, you can check under Settings > More (Tab) > About Device > Software Update. With the new Android version, you’ll get an updated flat Material Design interface and a slight improvement of performance as it runs on ART (Android Run Time) instead of Dalvik.

It made headlines being the first equipped with the biggest amount of RAM you could find on a smartphone. In terms of looks, the Zenfone 2 looks pretty much like the rest of the family with its metallic back and general styling, with the smartphone coming in at a 3.9mm thickness at its thinnest point. They’ve also deviated a bit from its flat rectangular back to a slightly curved design that is supposed to be easier and more comfortable to hold and therefore harder to lose your grip. Also new is a rear mounted control just underneath the camera that can be used to snap selfies or adjust the volume. There are 3 distinctive versions of the Zenfone 2 that are hitting the market, with the higher end Zenfone 2 (ZE551ML) being home to a 5.5” full IPS screen, monstrous 4GB RAM, quad-core 64-bit 2.3GHz Z3580 Atom processor, 32GB storage and a 13 MP f/2.0 rear cam and 5 MP front snapper with a generously sized 3,000 mAh battery on top of dual SIM capabilities. There’s also a larger 64GB storage version available if you must have that extra storage. The Zenfone 2 (ZE550ML)’s slightly lower end sibling is just a notch below with a 1.8GHz Z3560 quad-core processor, 2GB RAM and a 5.5” 720p IPS display but otherwise shares the rest of the phone’s qualities. Both phones will be running Android 5.0 Lollipop with ZenUI 2.0 on top and will get an extra 5GB ASUS web storage. At the lower end of the spectrum, there’s the ZE500CL which comes with a smaller 5″ HD 720p display and it runs on an older 1.6GHz Z2560 processor that’s powering the previous Zenfone series. The specs internally are a notch down with a 8MP main and 2MP front cameras, while the battery is smaller as well at 2,500mAh.  While the phone itself isn’t something ridiculously innovative, it does have a few aces up its sleeve. Aside from having a crazy amount of RAM that would no doubt make it capable of handling high load apps, it also has one of the better cameras we’ve seen on a smartphone. It’s got enough modes to satisfy any shutter bug and the HDR mode makes quick work of photos that would otherwise look overexposed in bad lighting. For demanding situations, there’s a Super Resolutions mode where it combines 4x 13MP photos to produce a clearer picture with greater detail while reducing noise. The Zenfone 2 has officially launched in Malaysia and they are priced as follows: 
ZE500CL (5″ HD, 1.6GHz Z2560, 2GB RAM, 8GB ROM) – RM599 
ZE550ML (5.5″ HD, 1.8GHz Z3560, 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM) – RM749 
ZE551ML (5.5″ FHD, 1.8GHz Z3560, 2GB RAM, 32GB ROM) – RM899 
ZE551ML (5.5″ FHD, 2.3GHz Z3580, 4GB RAM, 32GB ROM) – RM1,099 
ZE551ML (5.5″ FHD, 2.3GHz Z3580, 4GB RAM, 64GB ROM) – RM1,299 Also launched alongside the ZenFone 2 earlier in Jakarta is a few new accessories that aren’t the same steak and potatoes you usually see when it comes down to cases and camera goodies. For starters assortment of optional back covers are certainly a breath of fresh air, taking full advantage of textures and shapes to make some rather unique covers both visually and physically. The shapes are available in five designs, with two symmetrical patterns and three asymmetrical patterns to choose from. Speaking of covers, they’ve also released an updated version of their flip cover, called the View Flip Cover Deluxe which has a larger view port than its predecessors and pretty much functions in such a way that you can go about your business without having to open the lid for basic functions. It’s essentially the same as the original View Flip Cover, with the exception that the cover seems more snugly fit to the phone and you can access more features via the ring of commands accessible from the window.  Some might find the cover very convenient with the added bonus of saving power by not having to utilize the entire screen but for functions besides what is available (like settings, camera, music and so on) you will still have to pop it open. The recent regional event also saw the launch of two new camera accessories as well as a powerbank; namely the ZenFlash, LolliFlash and the ZenPower 10050mAh powerbank. The aptly named ZenFlash is a rear mounted camera accessory that supposedly is able to turn your ZenFone 2 into a high end DSLR-like camera. It attaches via a set of suction cups which in turn sticks to a special sticker you attach to the rear the ZenFone, and the Xenon flash is 100x times brighter than the ZenFone 2’s own LED flash. It does give a huge boost to the details of photos taken in low lighting conditions and connects to the phone via the microUSB slot. Accompanying it is the circular LolliFlash which we hope is named after it’s similarity to a colourful lollipop, that affixes to the headphone jack of the phone. Its purpose is to act as a dual-toned LED torch to get more natural toned selfies, but also comes with a set of three colour filters in white, blue and purple that also function as protective covers for the device. The LolliFlash is priced at 119,000 Rupiah (about RM 33) which makes it a really cheap plug in flash for your phone that hardly puts a dent in your wallet, while the ZenFlash will retail for about RM 67. About the size of a business card, the  ZenPower powerbank  is not just small but it can juice even bigger devices thanks to a higher 2.4A output that charges quicker than standard 2.1A based powerbanks. The only thing we’d say is missing is a dual USB charging setup but for something this small being able to hold enough juice (10,050mAh) to power up your smartphone multiple times a day, it sounds pretty good to us. The powerbank is unfortunately only available for the Indonesian market at the moment, but it would be great if they make it available over the entire region given that it could make for a good competitor for Xiaomi’s super affordable powerbanks of the same capacity. In Indonesia, the ZenPower costs 269,000 Rupiah which is about RM75. Of course, prices could be very different if they get a local launch in Malaysia. It’s hard to say how well exactly the ASUS ZenFone 2 will perform without real-world testing but overall it does well in both the performance and the looks department, because for those prices, what’s not to like?"

Tim McDonough claims that the rumours about the chipset overheating are unfounded, as the early versions of the  HTC One M9  and  LG G Flex 2  which overheated were in their testing phase and not ready for commercial release. He also stated that these “pre-release models” were made to find bugs, with pre-release hardware being different from commercial hardware and somewhere along the line someone took those test results and leaked them on the internet. The issue said to have paved the way for Samsung using their own Exynos chip on the  Samsung Galaxy S6  and  S6 edge  but the Snapdragon 810 chipset can be found powering the HTC One M9,  Xiaomi Mi Note Pro  and the LG G Flex 2. However, the company does have hopes that it’s Snapdragon 820 chip that will launch later this year to do much better. It will feature a computing platform called Zeroth that is intelligent enough to know if the phone is outdoors or indoors and the time of day to manually adjust the phone’s camera for the best photograph settings. It’s also capable of indexing images by keywords thanks to image recognition abilities. The company is planning on releasing a SDK for Zeroth for developers to play around with, which is part of Qualcomm’s strategy to win back whatever support it can after the controversy regarding the Snapdragon 810.

ZTE’s latest flagship will come in three variants, all sporting the same specs but with different RAM and storage options which pretty much influences their pricing. Under the hood, the ZTE Nubia Z9 features a Snapdragon 810 processor, NFC, 16 megapixel f/2.0 rear and 8 megapixel Sony front camera  combo alongside a 2900mAh battery and Nubia UI 3.0 out of the box. But what really makes it special here is the 2.5D glass display which is a 5.2 inch 1080p screen that has a 0.8mm bezel which uses some optical sorcery to reflect the on-screen content to give it a bezel free look. The phone itself will be just  8.94mm thick, without a protruding rear camera. The Z9 also gets a sound boost thanks to Neosound 4.0, an AKM4961 Hi-Fi processor and Dolby 7.1 surround sound. The phone also features a FIT interactive frame that allows the phone’s body to be touch sensitive and react to gesture controls that will allow users to activate the camera, take screencaps and adjust the brightness among other things. The Exclusive edition of the phone also gets their new TIO patented fingerprint tech on the power and volume rockers that can be used to unlock the phone. As for the price, the Nubia Z9 is certainly priced like a flagship, with the Classic version coming with 3GB AM and 32GB storage costing 3499 CNY (about RM 2025) and the Elite version comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage for 3999 CNY (about RM 2315) and the Exclusive variant that comes with TIO tech, 4GB RAM and 64GB storage for a rather ridiculous 4499 CNY (RM 2604) The Z9 is currently on pre-sale in China so it shouldn’t be too long before resellers get their hands on the device locally.

With its incremental alphabet naming convention, the next version would start with the letter M and it would take probably a few months before they reveal its final name.  For the Android M, Google is appears to be focusing on improved notification and greater voice controls beyond the typical “OK Google”. So far no word on the design but we reckon they would be some subtle tweaks from its current  Material Design  that was introduced with Lollipop.  About the same time last year, Android L was  introduced  during Google I/O 2014 and it was officially  launched as Android 5.0 Lollipop  in October. That’s also the same time they had announced its  Nexus 6  phablet and  Nexus 9  tablet which came with Lollipop out of the box. In terms of OS adoption rate, Lollipop is still far from dominating the Android platform. At the  most recent count , Android 5.0 Lollipop takes 9% of total Android devices, while the latest Android 5.1 having just 0.7%. Most devices, close to 40% are still running on Android 4.4 KitKat and the biggest hurdle comes from device makers that are slowly pushing updates to its current handsets.  With the Chinese brands aggressively pushing cheap and cheerful handsets, they are notoriously known for slow software updates. Only recently we are seeing new devices being announced with Lollipop out of the box but there’s still no visibility of them upgrading their current KitKat flagships to Lollipop. In their home market, software updates for these Chinese brands doesn’t seem to be a priority as personalised themes and UI are more critical in their home market. As comparison, the mainstream brands such as HTC, Sony and Samsung have already pushed Lollipop updates internationally even for last year’s models. With Android M coming up soon, the software gap will increase if manufacturers don’t keep up with the latest updates.  Google I/O 2015 is  happening  on 28th May and it will be streamed live over YouTube. If you want to know what’s in store for Android, this is one event you won’t want to miss. [  SOURCE  ]"

It has just passed SIRIM certification with the model number WI500Q, which will be distributed by Dynamics Distribution and ECS Astar. Announced  late last year , the ZenWatch is probably the most elegant looking Android Wear considering the rest of the Android Wear players have turned to the more classical round shape. This comes as a surprise as initially ASUS Malaysia  had no plans  of bringing their first wearable device to our market. Instead, it was only sold at selected countries. The ZenWatch gets a 1.63″ AMOLED display that pushes 320×320 resolution and it runs on a mainstream 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor with 512MB. There’s 4GB of storage, Bluetooth 4.0, 9-axis sensor and an embedded bio sensor to track your heart rate.    Most recently, local retailer DirectD has started  selling imported units  of the ZenWatch at RM799. Can ASUS Malaysia priced it lower? If it goes below RM700, this could give the Pebble Steel that’s currently priced at US$199 (about RM715) a run for its money."

Like the past Galaxy Note launches, the upcoming Galaxy Note 5 should be making its debut at IFA 2015 that’s happening in early September.  The folks at Sammobile had acquired a few interesting details of the upcoming flagship phablet. Unlike the Galaxy Note 4, there would be only one variant for the Galaxy Note 5 which possibly means that there won’t be a unit running on Snapdragon 810 or 820 processor. The display of the standard Galaxy Note 5 would be a flat screen that pushes either 2K (Quad HD) or 4K resolution.  In terms of processor, it is rumoured to be having a newer Exynos 7422 unit which is their first all-in-one solution with an integrated CPU, GPU, RAM, storage and modem in a single chip. However there’s also a possibility that the Note 5 could be running on a newer Exynos 7430 processor.   For the curve display variant a.k.a.  Note edge  replacement, it is speculated as “Project Zen” internally. Unlike the Galaxy S6 edge and Galaxy Note edge which are essentially the same device with a different display, Project Zen apparently would be a very different device and the hardware may not be entirely high-end.  The display is said to be featuring a smaller 5.4″ or 5.5″ dual-curved Super AMOLED display and runs on a Hexa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor that’s powering the  LG G4 . Other spec details includes an S-Pen, 16GB of storage, 16MP main camera with OIS and a 8MP front camera. Being a notch below the Galaxy Note 5, perhaps we could be seeing a smaller price gap between the two new models. Currently, the Galaxy Note Edge and the Galaxy S6 edge are priced RM500 more than its normal flat screen version. [  SOURCE  ]"

It will also have LTE support on top of a 2,600mAh battery as well as Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. As expected the Xperia C4 will be featuring a 13 megapixel rear camera alongside a 5 megapixel front camera, both of which have an LED flash as well as Autofocus and HDR modes. This is an upgrade from the Xperia C3’s 8 megapixel rear camera and they also sport a slightly larger battery as well as more RAM and double the internal storage. No news of the price yet but the phones will be available in certain markets starting June 2015 and will come in White, Black and Mint (green) colour options. Check out the video for more details:"
soyacincau,Xiaomi flagship models will never come with a microSD slot and it’s for your own good,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/08/xiaomi-flagship-models-will-never-come-with-a-microsd-slot-and-its-for-your-own-good/,"expandable memory,Hugo Barra,mi 4i,Mi Note,microSD,smart phone,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Flagship,Xiaomi Mi 4i,Xiaomi Mi Note","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-05-08,"In Xiaomi’s flagship line up including the  Mi 4 ,  Mi 4i  and  Mi Note , the lack of a microSD slot seems to be a pain point for users. In an interview with Engadget, its VP for Global, Hugo Barra explained that the decision is made for the sake of user experience.  He emphasised that microSD cards are incredibly prone to failure and the availability of cheap and unreliable cards had made the situation worse. In most cases, inferior cards cause performance issues, instability and crashes which will eventually frustrate their users. As a result, most people would blame it on the device for a terrible experience without considering that the root of the problem lies on the expandable storage.  Xiaomi isn’t the only one having the stand against microSD. Even Google has offered no microSD slots on its Nexus devices, except for its first model, the Nexus One which was made by HTC. Google’s Martias Duarte  once said  while microSD cards are ideal for users, they are actually confusing for users. For example when saving photos, videos and documents, users have to decide where does it go. Later on, they might not know if it is stored on the phone or on the card. He concluded that the overall experience to deal with microSD cards for the normal user is just too complicated. Despite that, the Android OS itself still supports microSD storage and it depends on manufacturers to offer it. If you look at the current flagship options, there are many that have started ditching the microSD card with Samsung being the latest candidate on the Galaxy S6. For Samsung, their reason is on aesthetics as well as performance. Their new flagship utilises a  faster UFS 2.0  storage which is almost 3X faster than standard eMMC 5.0 storage and having a microSD card might be a bottleneck for its performance. Other players that opt-out from having a microSD slot on their flagship include Motorola, OnePlus and even Meizu. For those who insists on having an expandable storage, you still have LG, Sony Xperia, Huawei and HTC that supports it. Interestingly Xiaomi does offer microSD expansion on their Redmi series but that’s obviously due to its tiny 8GB of storage which simply isn’t enough. However the usage of microSD for the Redmi was  severely limited at first  and eventually they allowed you to save photos, videos and music directly onto the microSD instead of its internal storage.  The reason of simplifying the user experience seems sound and this somewhat affirms Apple’s tradition of having no expandable storage since day one of its iPhone. However if that’s the case, Xiaomi should really consider raising the minimum storage of their flagship models to at least 32GB. 16GB is simply not enough these days as the base operating system and native apps would have take up nearly 6GB on a fresh device. They do have larger 64GB version of their Mi 3, Mi 4 and even the Mi Pad but Xiaomi has hardly offered them outside of China. In the case for OnePlus, at least they did better by  offering their 64GB storage model  when they launched in Malaysia.   While cloud storage seems to be the future, mobile internet connectivity isn’t exactly seamless for this to work especially in developing markets that Xiaomi is in. If you’re stuck with just 16GB of storage and with no microSD slot, your only option left is to get one of those  micro USB OTG flash drives . What do you think? Is the microSD slot a critical factor in a flagship smart phone?   [  SOURCE  ]"

While we wait for Xiaomi Malaysia’s official announcement, our southern neighbour will commence its Mi 4i sales next Tuesday, 12th May at noon. In Singapore, the Mi 4i is priced at S$279, which is RM753 when converted directly with today’s rates. As usual, only the White colour version is available for purchase.  So when is Malaysia’s turn? The device has already passed our  local SIRIM  certification, so it is likely to be officially available in the weeks to come. Just recently, the higher-spec  Mi 4  model has  finally went on sale  in Malaysia but it comes only with 2G/3G support. Without 4G LTE, the Mi 4’s asking price of RM1,199 is a bit too much to ask considering there are better flagships out there with 4G support. So if you’re looking for faster connectivity, the Mi 4i would be a better option. It gets a 5″ Full HD display that’s optimised for outdoor use and powering it is a mid-range 2nd generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. On-board it gets 16GB of storage and it also comes with a 13MP main and 5MP front camera. In terms of battery, it has a larger 3,120mAh battery which is one of the largest capacity in the 5″ smart phone category. It supports dual-SIMs with 4G LTE. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop with their own MIUI 6 interface on top. Need something bigger? The 5.7″  Mi Note  appears to be making its way into Malaysia. It was also  recently spotted  in SIRIM’s database and it is likely to be priced around RM1,300-RM1,400 (2,299 CNY) once it gets here. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

soyacincau,The Surface 3 is probably the best tablet for those on the move,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/05/06/microsoft-surface-3-review-probably-the-best-tablet-for-those-on-the-move/,,,2015-05-06,"Microsoft had been tinkering with the idea of a tablet PC since the early days of Windows XP. The first one I’ve played with was the Compaq TC1000 which essentially is a laptop with a rotatable touch screen display. It was heavy, impractical and the form factor wasn’t what you would consider as an ultra portable device. Most recently they have finally nailed it with its Surface line up and the latest  Surface Pro 3  was introduced with the bold claim of being a tablet that could replace your laptop. Starting from RM2,729 excluding the keyboard, the Surface Pro 3 is on the high side, especially when you can get a decent spec laptop for less. So if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative, here comes the Microsoft Surface 3 that’s priced from under RM2,000. Not only it is cheaper but it is also the thinnest and lightest Surface yet.  The past non-Pro Surfaces are pretty basic with a rather limited Windows RT. While it looks the same, it doesn’t give you the full Windows experience like installing Windows based application. For the new iteration, the Surface 3 runs on Windows 8.1 and you can install programs like your everyday PC. The front gets a 10.8” display that pushes a decent full HD resolution of 1920×1280, which is very sharp for a screen at this size. Powering the Surface 3 is an Intel Atom Quad-Core x7-Z8700 processor with a choice of either 2GB or 4GB RAM. I know what you’re probably thinking but the Atom x7 series is quite competent and Microsoft reckons that it could push about 80% performance of an equivalent Core i3 processor. That on paper should be sufficient enough for average use."

During its  main announcement  in January, the Mi Note Pro was priced at 3,299 CNY (about RM1,900). Now they have reduced its pricing to 2,999 CNY (about RM1,728) and it even comes with a couple of tweaks as well. With the 64-bit 2.0GHz/1.5GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor powering the Mi Note Pro, there’s always a concern with regards to heat. For the Mi Note Pro, they have improved its thermal efficiency and it maintains a cool 36.3 degree Celsius after 20 minutes of gaming. In terms of performance, it pushes over 63,000 points on Antutu which is higher than other Snapdragon 810 smart phones. According to Xiaomi, the HTC One M9 scores around 57,000 points while the LG G Flex 2 trails behind slightly at about 56,000 points. The Mi Note Pro obviously has the added advantage as it has 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM.  In terms of display, the Mi Note Pro also gets a Sunlight display which is similar to the recently launched  Mi 4i . Under bright outdoor sunlight, the display adjusts its contrast on the pixel level in real time for better readability.   In the battery department, the Mi Note Pro gets a slightly larger 3,090mAh capacity battery, which is merely 3% more (90mAh) than the standard Mi Note. It also supports Quick Charge 2.0 (9V 1.2A) that is capable of juicing it up from 0-70% in one hour. For greater efficiency, the Mi Note Pro boasts Parallel charging technology where it has two charging modules which increases its charge rate while distributing heat evenly.  The rest of the device remains unchanged with a 13MP Sony f/2.0 main camera with image stabiliser, while the front gets a 4MP camera which is similar to HTC’s Ultrapixel camera. For storage, it gets 64GB on-board which isn’t expandable. The Mi Note Pro also supports 4G LTE with Cat 9 through carrier aggregation and it support speeds up to 450Mbps.

The new   Zenfone 2  was recently  launched  for the South East Asian market, and it will be  arriving in Malaysia  this month. Now its appears that the official Malaysian Zenfone 2 pricing has been revealed thanks to  MDroid . They have posted some on site photos of what seems to be a closed door dealer event where they have announced  four  five Zenfone 2 variants with a starting price of just RM599. Based on the info they have obtained at the event, the ZenFone 2 will be priced as follows: Compared to  Indonesia , Malaysians will get an even lower spec version for the entry-level option with a smaller 5″ display and it runs on an older Intel Atom Z2560 processor. This is similar to the current  ASUS ZenFone 5  that’s priced at RM559. For its mid-range model, the ZE551ML with a 1.8GHz Intel Atom Z3560 processor is similar to Indonesia’s spec at RM749 but we also get a larger 32GB capacity option at RM899, which is quite generous for its price.   For those wanting the best performance, the top end ZE551ML model with a faster 2.3GHz Z3580 processor and 4GB of RAM can be yours at RM1,099 for 32GB and RM1,299 for 64GB storage. ASUS is not only the first smart phone maker to introduce a smart phone with 4GB of RAM, but they are also priced lower compared to the competing mid-range smart phones.  Can the Taiwan manufacturer fend off competition from its mainland Chinese rivals? Looking at the price and specs alone, the answer is probably yes.

The beautiful  LG Watch Urbane   went on sale  internationally last week and DirectD is now making it available in Malaysia. Being an imported set, the LG Urbane Watch is priced at RM1,599, which is about the same price as the  Apple Watch Sport  which we’ve gotten recently.  It runs on Android Wear and it looks stylish with a round display that mimics a mechanical watch. At the front, it gets a clear 1.3″ P-OLED display that does 320×320 pixels resolution and it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with 512MB RAM and 4GB of storage.  You can take the LG Watch Urbane almost anywhere as it gets IP67 rated water and dust resistance as standard which allows you to submerge it up to 1 metre deep below 30 minutes. Keeping the lights on is a 410mAh capacity battery. For a more personalised look, the LG Watch Urbane accepts any compatible 22mm bands and by default, it comes with a leather strap out of the box.  There’s also a LG Watch Urbane LTE which isn’t coming to Malaysia. That comes with 1GB of RAM and a larger 700mAh capacity battery. Unlike the standard Urbane, the LTE variant runs on LG’s proprietary wearable platform that’s based on WebOS. Unfortunately the SIM is embedded and we are told that it would be sold only through participating telcos that offer it. Design wise, the LTE version looks more chunky and it gets additional 2 buttons compared to the standard version. In terms of colours, the Watch Urbane from DirectD is available in classic silver or pink gold, which looks closer to bronze in real life. If you’re interested, you can head over to DirectD’s  Watch Urbane  page. For those on Android that wish to stand out, this is probably the better alternative to the Apple Watch.

Under the hood, the new tablets are likely to have a 64-bit Exynos processor, 3GB RAM as well as 32GB storage with microSD expansion, possible optional Cat.6 LTE support and a 8 megapixel rear and 2.1 megapixel front camera combo. The display on the other hand is rumoured to be a Super AMOLED with a 1536 x 2048 resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio. It’s likely to run on Android Lollipop out of the box. Like the recently launched  Samsung Galaxy Tab A , the Tab S2 will come in an 8 inch and 9.7 inch variant. They are also expected to hit launch in Wi-Fi only and LTE supported models. The tablet is also expected to be very thin (sources say either 5.4 or 5.5mm) and to weigh in at 260g for the 8 inch model which could very well put the tablet at the world’s thinnest and lightest. June isn’t too far off so we’re likely to see more information on the Tab S2 as we approach release date. [ SOURCE ]"

While we have seen plenty about the watch already, there hasn’t been much details about the screen besides that it’s using a ‘Flexible Retina Display’ . The team behind  DisplayMate  decided to put the watch’s screen to the test and they’ve found that the Apple Watch Sport actually has a better display than that of the Apple Watch Edition. Granted the Apple Watch and the Edition are harder to scratch than the Sport due to their sapphire crystal displays which a tougher than normal glass.Unfortunately they reflect about twice as much light as well. Based on their tests, the Apple Watch with sapphire crystal has a reflectance of 8.2 percent which is almost double of that of Ion-X glass. Compared to an iPhone 6 which has a reflectance of 4.6 percent, an Apple Watch essentially reflects 178 perfect of the light reflected by the iPhone 6. DisplayMate hasn’t tested an Apple Watch Sport that has Ion-X glass but they feel that they would have similar results to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Using sapphire could end up being an issue for smartwatches because the reflected light could impact the display visibility to the point the screen’s own brightness would be compromised and ultimately become difficult to see clearly.

The Mi 4i is seen as an affordable alternative of the Mi 4 flagship and it supports dual-SIM with a wider range of internationally supported 4G LTE bands.

If we compare this with the latest mid-ranger, the Mi 4 has better specs with a Quad-Core Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM and it gets a more premium metal body frame. With the lack of 4G support, is anyone still interested in a 3G only flagship? Even their entry-level Redmi 2 supports 4G LTE.  Thanks guys for the tip via twitter! [  VIA ,  2 ,  3  ]"

If the unlimited call proposition is too much for a single line, Maxis is now allowing  you to take up additional supplementary lines with the MaxisOne Share Plan. For RM48/month, the extra mobile line can enjoy the same limitless talk and SMS, while mobile internet is shared from its main data quota.  The MaxisOne Share plan is only applicable to MaxisOne Plan subscribers (RM128/month) that top up at least 1GB of data (RM30/GB) and this comes up to RM158/month. Like its original MaxisOne Plan, data is not going to be cheap. If you need more, they charge RM30 for every extra GB per month and you can add-on to maximum of 5GB extra. If you do the math, the RM30/GB rate is expensive and it would cost you RM150/month just to get additional 5GB.  Each MaxisOne Plan subscriber can get up to 5 supplementary lines but the MaxisOne Share is limited to just 2 per principal account. This means, if you have 5 supplementary lines in total, you could only get 2 MaxisOne Share plans and the remaining 3 would be signed with other plans (e.g. SurfMore 30, Value Plus Family or Value Plus Internet 30). If talking and and sending messages are more important for your household, the MaxisOne Share could be an alternative to keep a chatty family happy. Assuming each person can survive with 1GB of internet per month, it will cost RM85/month per user for a postpaid plan that offers unlimited calls and SMS to anyone within Malaysia (except for Premium numbers).

To settle this once and for all, OPPO has finally released its official press images and it looks more down to earth than what we’ve seen so far. True to its tradition of thinness, the R7 maintains a slim form factor and it resembles closely with its current ultra-thin  OPPO R5 . The polished metal frame still covers the sides but the front appears to have a slight 2.5D curvature similar to an iPhone 6.   What’s interesting is they have changed its front buttons from a 3 capacitive option to a 2 capactive + 1 physical home button, similar to Samsung. Not sure if they would include a fingerprint scanner but the possibility is definitely there. So far there’s no word on specs but we do hope that OPPO would put a larger battery this time around. We are sure most users would not mind sacrificing a couple of milimetres for an all day usage.  The OPPO R7 is expected to be launched sometime in May. Like all flagship OPPOs, you can expect faster VOOC charging that does 0-75% in 30 minutes. For the R7, we can probably expect more vibrant colours than the usual black and white options on the current R5.  [  SOURCE  ]"

The  HTC One M9  was announced during MWC 2015 and it offers a 5.0″ Full HD display with Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. However the One that’s coming to Malaysia is the  HTC One M9+  that was  launched in China  earlier this month. As  teased  a while back, we are getting just the One M9+ and HTC isn’t bringing the 5″ One M9 into local market. Is the M9+ better since it has the + sign? Well it all depends on what you’re looking for.  Despite the plus sign, the One M9+ is slightly bigger at 5.2″ but it does a higher Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440, which pushes a pixel density 534ppi. As comparison, the 5″ One M9 settles for a full HD 1920×1080 resolution that gives it a pixel density of 441ppi. Under the hood, the One M9+ runs on a 2.2GHz MediaTek MT6795 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and HTC reckons that it shouldn’t differ much in actual usage compared to Qualcomm’s top end Snapdragon 810 series processor. On-board it gets 32GB of on-board storage which is also expandable with microSD up to 128GB. Another key difference is the main camera as the One M9+ get an additional secondary unit, making it a duo-camera set up with a 20MP unit. Meanwhile at the front, it gets 4MP Ultrapixel camera for selies and a fingerprint scanner on a capacitive home button that’s placed right smack in the middle of its boom sound speaker grill. Despite going slightly bigger in size, the One M9+ retains the same 2,840mAH capacity battery as the original One M9.  Another drawback of the One M9+ is its lower Cat4 4G LTE support, instead of Cat9 4G LTE with the One M9 (with Carrier Aggregation). From what we are told, the One M9 is only heading towards developed markets while the rest including Malaysia, India and China would be getting the One M9+ instead. So the HTC One M9+ is different from  what we’ve seen  at MWC 2015. Priced at RM2,599, it carries the same price tag as the Samsung Galaxy S6 32GB and it will be available on 30th April 2015. As comparison, the HTC One M8 was  launched last year  at RM2,399 with 16GB of on-board storage."

According to Pebble, they are working closely with Apple to prevent such incidents from reoccurring in future. They added that the recent rejections only affected a small number of apps and there are many popular apps like RunKeeper that have been approved without problems. They urged developers to continue making apps and feel free to mention the support for Pebble if it does work as intended. Sounds good? Probably it’s just a case of an overzealous employee at Apple.

The Sony Xperia P2, as it has appeared on Chinese website  cnbeta  will have a 1.9GHz Snapdragon 810 mated to 3GB RAM and 32GB storage as well as a 5.2 inch Full HD IPS display as well as 5 megapixel front snapper and a huge rear 12.1 MP camera featuring Sony’s own 25mm F2 G OSS Lens as well as 4K video recording capabilities. The most surprising bit about the Xperia P2 is it’s absolutely massive 4,240 mAH battery which is probably the influencing factor in it’s estimated thickness of 10.9mm at it’s thickest point. The Xperia P2 is like to retain it’s chunkier boxy looks due to this, but there’s a high chance the transparent strip will be illuminated much like the original P series. We are seriously hoping that this leak is indeed true because the Xperia P2 already is looking way too good. Check out the full specs below. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

The G4 will also have a large removable 3,000mAh battery with built in quick charging and wireless charging as well as NFC support.  It also has a 5.5 inch Quad HD IPS display at 2560 x 1440 resolution and 538ppi and be running Android 5.1 Lollipop overlaid with LG’s UX 4.0 out of the box. LG says the new screen has up to 20 percent greater colour reproduction on top of a 25 percent brightness increase and 50 percent greater contrast on top of employing Advanced In-Cell Touch (AIT) tech that combines the LCD and touch sensors into a single layer for better colours and touch sensitivity. The camera combo for the G4 is looking rather good, with a 16 megapixel f/1.8 rear shooter with a 8 megapixel front camera with f/2.0 aperture, it’s quite obvious that they are trying to cater towards the selfie crowd as well. OIS 2.0 now works over three axes as opposed to the original two, which allows the camera to compensate in two degrees compared to the LG G3 who could handle only one. The phone’s rear key lets you take selfies even when the display is off by double tapping it to shoot. For those who like to work on the go, the LG G4 comes with Google Office pre-installed and Drive users get an extra free 100GB of Google Drive storage for two years. LG also says that Volkswagen vehicles can view a car friendly version of the G4’s interface with MirrorLink with integrated contacts, navigation and music when connected. Aside from the luxury leather backing that has garnered the G4 lots of attention, the phone will also be shipping with a 3D “ceramic”  patterned back cover , and both will feature a slight curve which LG says helps with durability. Global pricing and availability will be announced for their individual markets, with availability in Korea starting today. The phone will be available in Metallic Gray, Ceramic White and Shiny Gold for the ceramic covers, while it’s available in Black, Brown, Red, Sky Blue, Beige and Yellow for the Genuine Leather covers."

The HTC One M9+ has a lot in common with the  One M9  in terms of looks, down to the metal finishing.  Despite looking like a carbon copy of the One M9, the One M9+ does get a minor bump up in terms of screen real estate as well as a fingerprint scanner. Also launched is the  HTC Desire 826 , which was announced earlier this year at CES. Under the hood, the One M9+ will have a octa-core MediaTek helio X10 processor at 2.2Ghz, a 2,840mAh battery as well as a 20 megapixel f/2.2 Duo main camera and UltraPixel front shooter, which isn’t too different from what’s in the One M9 save for the processor. Like it’s sibling, the One M9+ will be running on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop with HTC Sense on top. The huge rear camera will also sport a built in sapphire glass lens cover to prevent scratches. On top of this, the phone will be sporting 3GB RAM and 32GB on-board storage with expandable memory of up to 2TB with claims from HTC that the phone is future proof in terms of storage. Like many flagship models, the One M9+ will be sporting NFC the One M9. As far as the screen is concerned, the One M9+ has a 5.2-inch display with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 at 564ppi and an aspect ratio of 16:9. As for the Desire 826, the mid-range successor to the Desire 820 will feature a 5.5-inch Full HD display as well as a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615 processor mated to 2GB RAM alongside 16GB expandable storage. It will also support 4G LTE and dual-SIM capabilities on top of possessing a 13 megapixel f/2.0 camera and a 4 megapixel UltraPixel selfie snapper up front. As far as specs go, the Desire 826 is quite similar to Xiaomi’s recently launched  Mi 4i  smartphone. The HTC One M9+ will retail for RM 2,599 and will come in three colours, with Gold on Silver and Gunmetal Gray available from April 30th , with the Gold on Gold variant available later this year. Meanwhile the HTC Desire 826 will retail for RM1,359 and it is also available on April 30th. All prices listed are inclusive of GST.  However the  HTC One M9  won’t be making a local appearance due to the country not being able to support LTE Cat6 bands and will only be launching in countries that support it, while the One M9+ runs on Cat4.

The 38mm Apple Watch scores a repairability score of 5 out of 10, having generally easy to remove components but is a bit difficult to get inside due to tiny tri-wing screws and a fully encased S1 system as well as cables are all soldered in, making board repairs nigh impossible.

And if P1 has only one point to make, loud and clear to you, it would be this – the challenger operator is making a comeback. Network performance, customer service quality and trust issues are just some of the many things that need fixing at P1, and the two foremost executives in the company – Kelvin Lee and Azizi A. Hadi – know exactly what to do to turn P1 around. Kelvin Lee is no stranger to P1, having been part of the Green Packet family for a good ten years. In 2011, Kelvin was asked by CC Puan, the CEO of P1, to join P1 in the role of Chief Commercial Officer to manage the sales and customer services of P1’s products and services. A veteran in Green Packet and P1, Kelvin has been through it all. And yet, the upbeat, approachable techie, is more energetic than ever, ready to transform P1 to become one of the country’s most innovative mobile operator. His optimism and energy is understandable, Kelvin has an experienced point man watching his guard. Azizi in his role as P1’s COO, is a new joiner but is no stranger to the telco industry given his wealth of experience in TM for the past eight years covering various roles from oversight of migrating from a digital to fully IP network, the HSBB (high speed broadband) rollouts to the SME business segment management. Kelvin and Azizi believe that P1, with full support from,  Telekom Malaysia  and SK Telecom, two giants from the telecommunications world – both with considerable investments in P1 – and a team of experts that’s now more pumped up than ever, is now in the best position to shake up the telecommunications space in Malaysia with the promise of being country’s first ever fully converged telecommunications provider. But what does this mean to you? Are you ready for a fully converged telecommunications provider? Watch as Kelvin and Azizi explain why 2015 is going to be the year for P1 and you. Let’s make things clear from the start, P1 has had some real issues in the past. Network issues, customer service issues, financial issues, you name it, P1 has it. Having seen it all, Kelvin openly admits, P1 has had its setbacks. “When P1 started, it provided a great product and service, but as a small company trying to operate against huge, established competitors we hit some bumps along the way. It was with good intentions P1 created a new service, but it had initial teething troubles with expanding coverage and increasing bandwidth,” “Financial difficulties also halted further expansion of P1’s coverage towers, which is why some people may have experienced moments of congestion and didn’t see their coverage area expanded.” However, the company doesn’t want to dwell in the past. The leadership acknowledges that it has made some mistakes but now it wants to get rid of the skeletons in the closet and start from afresh. It wants to build an ideal network that combines the best and latest in mobile data and find areas to converge with TM on fixed line internet technology to deliver telecommunications beyond what its competitors can muster. But in the hyper-competitive mobile telecommunications market, it’s understandable that Kelvin is keeping his cards close to his chest. “P1 realised there were issues to overcome and has spent a long time coming up with solutions that are now being put into place. These problems are now being fixed in the near future. That’s all I can say on that so watch this space.” Azizi shares the same opinion saying that customer satisfaction is paramount at P1 but for changes to take effect, he asks for time. “Changes are being made from the ground up, at the employee level. We’re growing customer service and we have some ideas that we’re going to set-up that will truly set us apart from competitors, for the better. We can’t say any more than that, except that it requires a bit of time, but it’s absolutely a priority, and it’s going to make us very different from the other big telcos in Malaysia.” Back in 2008, P1 was an ambitious brand, one that stuck it to the big boys, a brand that showed that a little guy can have the courage to fight, and to win – well, almost. When P1’s went online in late 2008, there weren’t many other mobile broadband offerings available in Malaysia that could match what P1 could deliver. P1’s, back then, cutting edge WiMAX network delivered speeds that competing 3G networks couldn’t match. And then, there’s the value proposition. Pair the pure performance of WiMAX with attractive pricing that was unlike anything that market could offer, it wasn’t long before P1 became the buzzword in wireless internet to a point where the brand saw demand far exceeding what its network could deliver. P1 was a victim of its own success. The bright spark in wireless communications that was flying high took a hit. Having lived with these growing pains, Kelvin acknowledged the issues that P1 faced in the past but it is the same issues that made the company more resilient and better. “We did something no operator dared. A new operator, using a completely new technology, we knew that things were going to be challenging for but we also knew that we can be successful. We know that we had the right stuff. Being the entrepreneurs that we are, we’ve simply had to revamp our strategy. With the collective support of strong parent companies, we now have a way forward. We want to win back the hearts of our customer, earning their trust. The only way to do this is by pure hard work.” Azizi agrees and adds that network is something that P1 really needs to build a wonder network, one that really needs to match the best that its competitors can offer and then some. “We need to ensure that the service levels for the existing 4G offering are increased to live up to high customer expectations – before we can introduce new products and services this year with LTE. To do this, we first have had to invest into the 4G network sufficiently to cater for a 99.7% uptime. In parallel, we’re also investing into the customer service representative head count – an increase by a further 50%. The goal is to be able to consistently respond to a customer enquiry within 48 hours of it being raised via the numerous official communication channels.” Beyond everything else, P1 knows that the road to its success is one where happy customers walk, and that’s where the combined expertise of TM and SK Telecom will be critical. TM is now the controlling shareholder in P1 with a 55.3% stake. The investment into P1 allows TM to take a step into the next chapter of its play book, i.e. for mobility solution offerings to complement its fixed broadband leadership position to support future cross-selling and up-selling. Could Malaysians dream of potentially having a single provider and a single bill and a single point of contact covering the triple play offering of fixed home broadband, IPTV as well as for mobile broadband services? The dream looks promising. As for SK Telecom’s role in this tripartite investment, Kelvin elaborated “They have been a strategic investor in P1 since 2010. SK Telecom is a telecom and technology powerhouse with over 14 million people reaping the rewards of the LTE Advanced network in South Korea. That’s over 50% of the LTE subscriber base in South Korea!” This puts P1 in a prime position to deliver what is possibly one of the best mobile networks in the country, possibly the world. Clearly, P1 is set to take on Malaysia once again with LTE in 2015. Will it be different this time around compared to 2008 when P1 dared to take on TM with 4G? Especially given the likes of Maxis, Celcom and DiGi who have had a head start of some years in this space, which is not something to underestimate. But the future is looking bright for P1. Given P1’s combined forces with big brother TM, the ability to leverage the vast backbone infrastructure links and the deep pockets means that P1 is off to a good start. If TM’s proven ability to roll out HSBB in record time in Malaysia could also rub-off on P1’s LTE rollout, we may well see a viable in the LTE space as early as the second half of 2015 making it exciting for you. The best part is yet to come. The anticipation of the technology advantage that SK Telecom brings to P1 could be the secret sauce that will enable P1 to offer a differentiation from its competitors. Without quite letting the cat out of the bag about what is in store for consumers with the introduction of LTE in 2015, Kelvin suggested that we look at the innovations that SK Telecom has brought about in South Korea with the applications and services that extend across every area of a person’s digital lifestyle, from seamless entertainment, to secured payment to high definition voice to give us a view of what to expect with P1 in the future. Promising days loom ahead with this late entrant into the mobile broadband space stirring a market that is well-settled. Stay tuned for the ripples that P1 is slowly but surely creating. You’ll want to see what’s coming."

The Xiaomi team also answers some of the more pressing questions about the Mi 4i, like the reason behind lack of a microSD slot which was removed due to there being no space on the phone to place it. Barra has also confirmed that might be considering a 64GB model for the Mi 4i but this depends a lot on sales and popularity of the larger 16GB model.

Now the struggling ISP has been ordered by the courts to go into liquidation, marking an end of a legacy that connected Malaysians to the world. Its former CEO, Dr. Mohammad Awang Lah had posted on  Facebook  about the news and had expressed sadness that the ISP he helped started had ended up this way. However he also expressed hope that it could turn around for the better under safe hands. Jaring was started in 1986 under the name RangKom which was renamed to Jaring in 1992. Eventually it became a part of MIMOS in 2002 and later on it was taken over by the Finance Ministry in 2007. The former CEO had also expressed frustration over the sale of Jaring last year to unsuitable parties that led to its eventual demise.

This is proof that you can mount a different OS on your smartwatch than what it came it, though it looks like it will still take a fair bit of work to get it working. So far only touch and basic Bluetooth support are functional, and other features like audio, motion sensor and the like would be difficult to implement as Android Wear isn’t open source like regular Android.

At the moment, that title is being held by the  Dell Venue 8 7000  at 6.0mm and as comparison, the  Galaxy S6  is currently 6.8mm thick. According to serial leakster  @OnLeaks , the Galaxy Tab S2 will have the dimensions of 237.17mm x 169.58mm x 5.5mm, which is more compact and thinner than the current Galaxy Tab S at 6.6mm. He also added that the new high-end tablet will have a  Galaxy S6  inspired design, so you can probably expect a metal frame with glass both front and back. In terms of specs, the Galaxy Tab S2 is likely to feature its current performance king Exynos Octa 7 processor as the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. For the display, similar to its  Galaxy Tab A  series, it would be having an iPad-like 4:3 display aspect ratio, which is the current trend adopted by newer Android tablets. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Sponsored,6 Things You Can Do on the Galaxy S6 edge,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/24/6-things-you-can-do-on-the-galaxy-s6-edge/,,,2015-04-24,"The  Samsung Galaxy S6 edge  is the world’s first smart phone to have a dual edge display. Following its release of its  GALAXY Note Edge , Samsung has taken is flexible display technology to the next level on its latest flagship. Apart from being more ergonomic and stunning to look at, the Galaxy S6 edge also comes with extra features as well. We’ve listed the 6 things to discover with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge after the break. Your smart phone is supposed to keep your friends and families closer and what better way to do it than to keep a swipe away from your thumb. Exclusive on the Galaxy S6 edge is a unique People Edge, where you can set your 5 favourite contacts on the edge of your phone. If you need to call or SMS any of them, you can now do so by simply swiping at the sides. In an event there’s a missed call or SMS, the People Edge will let you know by having a visible colour tab on the screen. In situations where you can’t answer phone calls, the edge also doubles up as an Edge notification light when placed face down. When there’s an incoming call from your 5 contacts, the preset colours will flash, letting you know who it is without revealing their details on the screen. So now you’ll know at a glance if it’s an urgent call that you need to take. Can’t answer the call? Just press and hold the heart rate sensor next to the camera. This will hang up the call and it will send an SMS to inform them that you’re unable to attend to the call. Like the GALAXY Note Edge, you can turn your Galaxy S6 edge as a night clock. This can be activated according to your preferred start and end time. The night clock display is dim enough to be visible without being a distraction. With its Super AMOLED display, it is quite power efficient and it shouldn’t take a major toll on battery life. With the Galaxy S6 edge in sleep mode, you can always check for notification on the edge display. By simply rubbing the edge from left to right repeatedly, you can take a glance if you have any missed calls, SMS or emails. This can be set under settings and you can choose the type of notifications to be displayed. Want more than just notifications? The Galaxy S6 edge opens up more possibilities with customisable Information Stream Panels. You can add anything from top news, twitter trends, stocks, sport scores or RSS feeds from the Edge screen settings. Similarly, you can view this by rubbing the edge display while the screen is off and you can scroll up or down to view the information stream panels. Whether you’re left or right handed, the Galaxy S6 edge designed for all users in mind. From the settings, you can switch the Edge screen position to either side of the curved display. This will be applied for all functions, including People Edge, Notifications, Night Clock and Information stream."
soyacincau,Apple Watch: You want to wear it just for its looks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/25/apple-watch-you-want-to-wear-it-just-for-its-looks/,"Apple iWatch,Apple Store Sydney,Apple Watch,apple watch edition,Apple Watch Edition Hands-on,Apple Watch First Impressions,Apple Watch Hands-on,Apple Watch Malaysia,apple watch sport,Apple Watch Sport Hands-on,Smart Watch,Watch OS","iOS,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-04-25,"So we went to Australia just to get our hands on the new Apple Watch which has officially rolled out on Friday. To get a better idea what options are available, we visited an Apple Store in Sydney to have a hands-on with the entire range. The Watch comes in 3 different models – The Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, which varies greatly in pricing and type of materials used. To suit people with different wrist, it is available in either 38mm or 42mm sizes. As this is Apple’s first wearable device, we try to find out what’s the big deal and most importantly is it any good as a smart watch? Read on for our first impressions. Let’s start with the design of the watch piece. The Watch gets a square display but they made it look less boxy with its curved round edges and corners. This comes as a refreshing approach for a square smart watch considering the competition like the Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear 2 and LG G Watch quite boxy with sharp edges. As you glance upon the display, there’s very little distraction from the frame or bezels as the screen dominates the front entirely. The dark background throughout the interface helps to hide the borders of the actual screen, giving an illusion of an edge to edge display. At the back, it gets a large sensor that looks quite bulky in the promo pics but during our try-on session, it doesn’t feel protruding or uncomfortable at all. We give credit to Apple for taking an effort to make the back aesthetically pleasing unlike other smart watches that place their heart rate sensors haphazardly. Since the Watch uses a magnet guided induction charge, there’s no unsightly charging ports or pins around the device. Standing out from the rest is the digital crown which tries to mimic the look of traditional watches. This is mainly used for zooming and scrolling, which is a substitute for pinch to zoom function that’s going to be a chore on a smaller screen. In terms of feel, the digital crown scrolls very loosely and personally we felt that it could use some friction like a radio dial on Hi-Fi systems. Pressing the crown button brings you back to home while the secondary button next to it gives you access to your favourite 12 contacts. The heart of the watch is the home screen which is very different from anything we’ve seen so far. Instead of the usual grid of icons or list of apps, you are greeted with an explosion of icons that gives you a bigger picture of what the watch has to offer. Moving around this interface is like going through a map where you can browse around by zooming in and out and you can jump into a function by tapping on the icon. To access menus or extra options, the Watch uses Force Touch which is basically a stronger tap on the screen. In a way, this feels easier than to press and hold or having an extra settings icon which is tough to tap on a small screen. There are a number of high resolution watch faces to choose from but unfortunately there’s no option to add 3rd party ones for now. To view notifications, you can pull it down by swiping from the top, like how you would normally do on a smart phone. To take a peek on the things that matter to you, swiping up from the bottom brings you glance. This is basically a collection of widgets that give you bite size info like the latest weather update, next calendar appointments, stocks and more. For communications, the Watch works as an extension to your phone and you can make and receive phone calls as well as handling messages. There’s no on-display keyboard which is really impractical for this size but you do get the option to dictate your reply or select from a list of pre-defined replies. On top of that, the Apple Watch tries to offer new ways of communicating such as sketching with a finger, sending taps and even let the other person feel your heart beat recorded from the sensor. Beginning with the basic Apple Watch Sport, the base model gets an aluminium body which comes with a smooth matte finish along with a choice of colourful rubber straps. We tried on both 38mm and 42mm versions, and for a guy, we prefer the 42mm size which offers a larger display. For the front, it is toughen with Ion X, which is stronger than normal glass but it lacks the scratch resistance of its more expensive Apple Watch and Watch Editions. While it gets a lightweight aluminium body, the design is exactly the same as its more expensive models. The straps are removable too and it latches off easily by pressing its unlocking button at the rear of the watch pieces. Although it is sold only with the rubber strap, you can change this to other options as an add-on since it uses the same mounting mechanism across the range. 
For the sports rubber strap, it feels similar to the original Pebble watch but it feels thicker feel with rounded edges. Out of the box, the rubber strap actually comes in 3 pieces. A single main strap with the buckle while the secondary piece with the holes come in 2 sizes to match different wrist sizes. The Apple Watch Sports costs A$579 (RM1.6K) for 42mm and A$499 (RM1.3K) for the 38mm version. The “Apple Watch” is their mid-tier range and with a higher price tag, it gets a more appealing stainless steel body with a reflective mirror finish. This puts it on par with its more mainstream stainless steel watches, and even including the Pebble Steel to a certain extent. Also upgraded is a Sapphire glass at the front which is more resistant to scuffs and scratches. The Apple Watch with the cheapest Sports Band option costs A$799 (RM2,230) for 38mm and A$879 (RM2,460) for the 42mm size. On top of that, it has the widest range of straps available – the Rubber Sports Band, Classic Buckle, Milanese Loop, Modern Buckle, Leather Loop and Link Bracelet. The Classic Buckle which is available only in 38mm has an interesting mechanism that is more than meets the eye. At first it looks like a typical leather strap with a round buckle but in actual fact, the buckle latches on securely with magnets. For those with bigger hands, the Leather Loop is the only leather alternative and it gives you freedom of adjustments with the strap looped around and sticks onto itself with magnets. This is similar to the Milanese loop which is made with fine metal. The most expensive strap available is the Link Bracelet, which is a metal band with a butterfly style clasp. Usually with most metal bands, the strap is adjusted by removing individual pieces with a tool. However for the Apple Watch Link Bracelet, Apple seems to have reengineered the metal strap with a tiny release button on each removable piece so that you can adjust it by hand without having to use tools. As expected from Apple, this obviously comes at a price and the 42mm Apple Watch with the Link Bracelet goes for A$1,479 (RM4,115) and it costs A$679 (RM1,900) just for the strap alone! For those with deep pockets for finer things in life, the Watch Edition is probably the most expensive product Apple has ever made. Available in 18 Carat Rose Gold or Yellow Gold, the Apple Watch Edition feels noticeably heavier than the other 2 models. The price is like putting a car on your wrist, with the 38mm Rubber Sport Strap version (shown above) going for A$14,000 (RM39K) and it goes all the way up to A$24,000 (RM67K) for the Modern Buckle Version (as shown below). Although the strap is similar to the mid-tier Apple Watch, they come with matching pin and buckle colours in either Rose Gold or Yellow Gold. Even the Sport Strap comes with a golden pin instead of silver, just to give you your money’s worth. Probably the most epic part of the Apple Watch Edition is the box that it comes in. It is a nice leather box that closes securely with magnets and it has a built in induction charger in the middle. So at the end of the day, you can recharge your watch in the box and it is powered via lightning connector that’s included in the package. Apple is not the first to come out with a smart watch and as a first generation device, we can see how the Cupertino company is trying to do things different. Most smart watches these day focus too much on the tech side of things, leaving basic aesthetics such as the watch piece and strap designs as an afterthought. Like its previous products, Apple takes a considerably amount of attention on the design as much as the tech that goes behind it. The Apple Watch piece is good but the variety of straps are making a whole world of difference on the look and feel of the entire package. It is clear that Apple has done a lot of work on the straps especially its leather link and metal link bracelet design. In fact, the tool-less mechanism for the link bracelet has been patented by Apple as well. There’s a big contrast between tech companies and traditional watch makers on how a smart watch should be designed. The tech brands try to make a smart device look timeless and mainstream, while the watch makers are trying to find a way to make their creations smarter. For Apple, the watch seems to be developed from ground up with fashion and design in mind, which makes it appealing even before trying out how it actually works. At the same time, they didn’t try to conceal the fact that it is a smart watch and they embraced the non-classical squarish front glass and they managed to do it tastefully with an all glass appearance. However we can’t say the same about the usability. In an attempt to be different, it will take a while to get used to its touch and scroll combination. There’s also the scribble and heart beat messaging feature which we found to be gimmicky for actual day to day usage. In terms of performance, the high resolution transitions are nice to look at but when it comes to apps, there’s a noticeable delay when we try to load. We are not too sure if this could be connectivity related but this is based on our experience with the sample units on the floor. Perhaps we will get a better experience from a final retail unit. The Apple Watch is also not waterproof for swimming but they reckon it is resistant enough to wear into the shower. Probably the biggest hurdle is the 18 hour battery life, which means you’ll definitely need to charge this on a daily basis. This is probably the shortest battery life for a smart watch considering the Pebble can last us 4-5 days and the Gear 2 could last 2 days on most occasions. The Watch Edition looks beautiful with its gold finishes and it comes in a beautiful looking Edition box. However with an asking price going close to RM70,000, it costs more than certain Rolex models. For those solely looking at functionality, the Apple Watch Sports would do just fine. It is illogical to pay more for the same watch inside except for some cosmetic differences which supposedly add more bling to your wrist at exorbitant prices. So how is it like to use an Apple Watch on a day to day basis? We have received our unit along with other Australians as the first country in the world to get it. So stay tuned for our full review coming soon. In the mean time, if you have anything you want to know, please leave a comment down below. Apple Watch Sport

From the clues  revealed  by HTC, the 5.2″  HTC One M9+  would be making its way to Malaysia and this was  verified by its listing  under our local SIRIM database.  According to  GadgetMTech , which obtained a dealer invite as shown above, the  Desire 826  would be launched in Malaysia as well. This is a new  mid-range  smart phone that features a 5.5″ Full HD display and it runs on a Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM and has 16GB of storage which is expandable. It gets a 13MP f/2.0 camera at the back while selfies are taken by a front facing 4MP Ultrapixel camera.  It also supports 4G LTE and dual-SIM slots, making this a very similar device to the  recently launched   Xiaomi Mi 4i . You can read up more about the Desire 826 in our  announcement post . What’s interesting is that GadgetMTech suggests that the flagship  HTC One M9  will not be coming to Malaysia. We can’t confirm this at the moment, and it would be strange for HTC Malaysia to do so as its  initial teasers  of “More Than One” points towards having at least two “One” devices. What do you guys think? Thanks  @CharlesTYK97  for the tip!"

One aspect where the Mi 4i can definitely stick it to the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 is in the camera department, if these official sample shots are any indication  With “just” a 13MP Sony-sourced rear camera that’s lacking OIS, it’s pretty amazing what the Mi 4i can achieve and it goes to show that you don’t need necessarily need a high pixel count to produce amazing results. What the engineers at  Xiaomi  have demonstrated here is that when hardware and software are properly optimised, the results can be pretty darn good.

In a bid to make it more accessible with greater value, Hotlink has slashed its new Tablet Plan SIM pack from RM60 to just RM30. It comes preloaded with 1GB of data and best of all, it is valid for 365 days. While this is good for those with very minimal data usage, the additional data top ups have been reduced as well. Initially priced at RM30 per GB, you can now top up 1GB extra at RM25 which is valid for 60 days. For greater value, you can top up 2GB for RM45 and this would be valid for 365 days. With a year long validity, you can top up more without the fear of wastage that’s usually the case for monthly validity plans.  There won’t be any extra charge if you exhausted your internet quota but you won’t be able to use it until you purchase another pass. Since it is targeted for tablet users, you can manage your account and buy internet top ups from their Hotlink RED App that’s available on Android and iOS. If your device has a phone function, you may also do so by calling *100#.  The Hotlink Tablet Plan is 4G enabled and do note that this is a data only plan, so you can’t use it to make calls and SMS. If you use a lot of data on the monthly basis, this is definitely not the plan for you. However with its year long validity with 2GB for RM45 top up option, this is perfect as an occasional backup SIM when WiFi isn’t available.  The SIM pack is available across all Maxis Centres nationwide. For more information, head over to  Hotlink’s Tablet Plan  page."

Developers are allowed to support Pebble smart watches.  As the  Apple Watch  is being shipped out to its customers, the forces at Cupertino appears to be cracking down on apps that play nice with other competing watches. A developer had gotten a rude shock to find their app being rejected for merely mentioning its support for the  Pebble Smart Watch . The affected app, SeaNav US has been around for close to 2 years now and they have been supporting the Pebble Smart Watch all these while. It appears that there’s a new policy to forbid app developers from mentioning any support for other mobile platforms, which is baffling considering Pebble isn’t exactly a competing mobile platform to start with.  To make matters worse, Apple responded to the developer and had pointed out its “support for the Pebble Smartwatch” description as being inappropriate on the app store. The following is the response from Apple: It is as if Apple is trying to force developers to support the Apple Watch by suppressing other competing watches from thriving on their platform. Looking at the response, these apps can continue to provide support for the Pebble Watch but they are not allowed to mention it anywhere on the app description, which is just plain oppressive. In SeaNav US app situation, what’s interesting is that the rejected app submission includes support for their new Apple Watch.  No doubt this is bad news for Pebble users on iOS and the reality is that there’s nothing much Pebble or its developers can do to turn this around. So does this mean Apple might ban Pebble’s  AppStore  next? [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
soyacincau,Samsung is introducing its Galaxy Tab A tablets in Malaysia next week,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/22/samsung-is-introducing-its-galaxy-tab-a-tablets-in-malaysia-next-week/,"Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Tab A,Samsung Galaxy Tab A Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Tab A Malaysia Launch,samsung malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-04-22,"Samsung Malaysia is releasing their first range of tablets for 2015 with the arrival of the  Galaxy Tab A . Unlike the past tablets from Samsung, the Galaxy Tab A series is now going for a squarish 4:3 display aspect ratio like the iPad instead of the usual 16:9 wide screen display. From its  launch in Russia  and most recently in the US, the Galaxy Tab A will come in 2 sizes – a compact 8″ and a 9.7″ size. Both are having similar processors, with a 64-bit Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 but the 9.7″ gets 2GB RAM while the smaller 8″ unit settles for 1.5GB. There’s 16GB of on-board storage but you can expand with microSD up to 128GB extra. For the US market, Samsung is throwing additional 100GB of OneDrive storage for 2 years, which is similar to the Galaxy S6.  For taking pictures, it gets a 5MP main and 2MP front camera and out of the box, it runs on the latest Android 5.0 with TouchWiz on top. Both models are available in WiFi and 4G LTE models and keeping the lights on is a 4,200mAh battery on the 8″ and 6,000mAh capacity unit on the full sized 9.7″ version. Probably the biggest let down would be the display, as it settles for a lower 1024 x 768 resolution. How well does it all hold together? We’ll find out next week as the local media event is happening on 29th April. Stay tuned for further details on the Galaxy Tab A for our Malaysian market."

The new device could be the  Mi 4i  which was  spotted recently  in benchmarks and Singapore’s IDA certification body. From what is known so far, the device is likely to be a international version of the Mi 4 but it carries a lower spec hardware of a Snapdragon 615 Octa-Core processor with 2GB of RAM. If priced competitively, this could be a compelling mid-range smart phone.  Like previous Xiaomi launches, they could have extra surprises as well.

While we expect the  HTC One M9  to appear officially in Malaysia, its other new flagship device, the  HTC One M9+  was recently spotted on SIRIM.  HTC Malaysia could be quite literal when it hinted its upcoming event to be “More Than One”. The HTC One M9 that was  announced  during MWC 2015 is their 2015 flagship offering with an premium unibody metal body that’s now enhanced with a dual-tone look. The front of the One M9 is similar as its current out-going model with a 5.0″ Full HD display but underneath, it gets a top notch 64-bit Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB of on-board storage that’s expandable with microSD. The 4MP effective Ultrapixel camera this time is being moved to the front while the back now gets a higher resolution 20MP main shooter with dual-tone flash. The battery is still non-removable but it gets a larger 2,840mAh capacity. Shortly after that, HTC had  announced 2 new devices  in China. The One M9+ is a bigger version of the One M9 with a 5.2″ Quad HD display but underneath it runs on a 64-bit Octa-Core MediaTek MT6795 processor with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The camera at the back also rocks 20MP but it comes with a secondary unit for a duo camera set up. While the exterior design retains the same look and feel, it also gets a fingerprint scanner that’s mounted at the front as a home button.  Meanwhile the One E9+ is supposedly the economical version but gets a much larger 5.5″ Quad HD display. While most of the specs are the same, it is a notch down with just 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, which can be expanded via microSD as well. For the back camera, it settles for a single 20MP main camera.  If both HTC One M9 and One M9+ are available, which would you choose? A 5″ Full HD Snapdragon 810 unit or a 5.2″ Quad HD version with a MediaTek MT6795 processor? To witness the HTC Malaysia launch, you can find out how to win a an invite over  here .

Amin Ashaari,3 features that make the Xiaomi Mi4i the most advanced phone below RM800 right now,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/24/3-features-that-make-the-xiaomi-mi4i-the-most-advanced-phone-below-rm800-right-now/,"Android,Android 5.0,mi 4i,miui 6.0,mobile devices,Xiaomi,Xiaomi launch,Xiaomi Mi 4i,Xiaomi Mi 4i Launch,Xiaomi Mi 4i Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-04-24,"Let’s face it, no matter how many times Hugo Barra calls the  Xiaomi Mi4i  a “flagship” smartphone, it’s not. The Mi4i lacks the raw power and many advance features that are present in what we consider flagship phones, like the iPhone 6, and the Galaxy S6. But that doesn’t mean you should discount the Mi4i as just another cheap phone from China, because the Mi4i is not just another cheap phone from China. Despite the competitive pricing, the engineers and designers at  Xiaomi  looked into every detail to ensure that the Mi4i delivers a performance and user experience that belies its bargain basement asking price, it probably is the most advanced smartphone you can get for under RM800 and here’s why. At 138.1mm, the Mi4i is exactly the same height as the iPhone 6 but it has a screen that’s 10% larger than the iPhone and a 7% higher screen-to-body ratio. That means, you get more screen and less phone, as a result the phone is pleasant and easy to hold and operate with one hand. Even those with smaller hands and digits will find is easy to stretch their fingers to the edge of the Mi4i display without too much of a hassle. The Mi4i has an advanced display developed by Sharp and JDI. Yes, it only pushes out 1080p but the engineers has optimised the software and the screen to produce a display that’s actually pretty good especially under direct sunlight thanks to what Xiaomi calls “Sunlight Display” technology that optimises the screen in any lighting condition allowing you to appreciate details and highlights whether you’re viewing images indoors or outdoors. During our hands-on session at the launch The technology works extremely well and is something users can really appreciate.   The fully laminated OGS (one glass solution) screen developed by Corning, is on par with many top-level smartphone displays in the market and you get a very respectable pixel density of 441ppi. In comparison, the iPhone 6 pushes 326ppi and the iPhone 6 Plus, 401ppi. The display on the Mi4i is also capable of producing a wider range of colours compared to the iPhone 6. Specifically, the iPhone 6 has a NTSC 72% colour gamut while the display on the Mi4i has an NTSC 95% colour gamut. This means colours are brighter and reproduced to mimic reality more accurately. The only issue we have with the Mi4i display is that it uses Corning Concore glass instead of the tougher and more resilient to breaking Corning Gorilla Glass. That doesn’t mean that Corning Concore glass is not strong. It is plenty strong and just as scratch resistant as Gorilla Glass but ultimately, when subjected to the same forces, Corning Concore will break before Gorilla Glass.  A smartphone is useless if you have to charge it all the time. Thankfully, the Mi4i has a 3120mAh battery and that is huge even for high-end flagship standards. Let’s do a quick comparison, the iPhone 6 has a 1810mAh battery, while the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus has a 2915mAh battery. The Samsung Galaxy S6 has a 2550mAh battery while the Galaxy S6 edge has 2600mAh battery. Notice what those flagship devices have in common? All of them have smaller batteries compared to the Mi4i and they cost more than twice as much as the Chinese phone. Even against Xiaomi’s own Mi4, the Mi4i’s battery is 9% smaller in volume but with 12% higher battery density.  And it’s not just any large battery either, the Mi4i battery is developed by two of the world’s leading battery suppliers, Sony and Samsung, and it’s packed with tech. It’s the first battery in the world to feature 4.4V high-voltage technology with the highest energy density platform of 700Wh/L polymer cells. So what does that all mean? You can expect almost two days (1.5 days) of actual run time on a single charge, and when you do need to charge, the Mi4i supports quick charging technology that support 5V 2A charging which is capable of charging an empty battery to 40% capacity in one hour and get up to full charge in three hours.   So there you have it, the top three features that I think, make the Mi4i most advanced smartphone for under RM800. Yes, the Mi4i can’t be considered a flagship smartphone but that’s not the appeal of the device the appeal of the Mi4i. The Mi4i is designed to deliver the best possible smartphone experience at a price, and in this respect the team at Xiaomi, who have been working on this project for over 18 months, have a winner with a device that offers decent performance with great value. Agree or disagree, share your thoughts in the comment section."

Launched at their first ever launch event outside of China, Xiaomi’s new phone looks more like a cheaper alternative to the  Xiaomi Mi4  which saw it’s debut last year as opposed to being a full on upgrade where the Xiaomi Mi4i is pretty much a ‘lighter’ version of the Mi4. Xiaomi says that the new phone has a polycarbonate unibody design that is 12 percent thinner and 13 percent lighter than the Mi4, being only 7.8mm thick weighing in a 130g whereas it’s predecessor came in at 8.9mm and weighed 149g. The Mi4i will have a 5 inch 1080p 441ppi IPS display with Corning Concore glass and features Sunlight Display. This will automatically adjusts the screen brightness and increases the quality of the image when in harsh sunlight. It’s supposedly much brighter and 30 percent more battery efficient as well, but we’ll find out for certain once we get to try it out. Under the hood, the Mi 4i sports a 2nd gen 64-bit quad-core Snapdragon 615 that runs at both 1.7GHz and 1.1GHz, with an Adreno 405 CPU. The processor is mated to 2GB RAM as well as 16GB storage and dual-SIM connectivity. Like it’s predecessors there’s seems to be no microSD slot. However it does have a slightly bigger battery 3120 mAH and supports Quick Charge and is rated to last about 1.5 days with average use. The Mi4i will also be Xiaomi’s first smartphone with Android 5.0 Lollipop with MIUI 6.0 out of the box and has been rated at 40.2k on Antutu. The rear camera is a Sony/Samsung 13 megapixel shooter with Xiaomi’s 5-element lens and f/2.0 aperture and the front snapper will be a 5 megapixel lens with 5-element lens, f/1.8 aperture as well as a 80 degree wide angle. The front camera will have the Beautify feature on by default due to popular demand, which adjusts the levels of beautification based on your estimated age. The camera combo is just slightly better than what the Mi4 has to offer with a very minor upgrade on part of the rear camera. Devices in India will also get to enjoy Visual IVR that will take the bite out the customer service experience on mobile letting you to skip voice prompts by displaying it all on screen instead. Visual IVR will be in the MIUI beta build in India first before it’s rolled out to everyone else. The Xiaomi Mi4i will retail for Rs.12999 (about RM 746) and will come in blue, white, black, yellow, pink, with the Malaysian availability coming in May."

Originally codenamed the Orbis, the design of the new smartwatch is a departure from the angular designs that Samsung has been using all this time, perhaps in a move to further differentiate  itself from the competition . Other details about the smartwatch is that there will be two variants of the device, a rotating bezel ring, crown shaped power button and wireless charging. It will also be running on Tizen and very likely one of Samsung’s Exynos chips as well. We still don’t have a real look at what the watch could be like yet, but it’s very likely to head down the same premium-wearable route as the Gear S. [ SOURCE ][ VIA ]"

For Malaysia, we are only getting the 32GB capacity version which some consumers have complained that’s too little. If you’ve been holding out from buying the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, word has it that Samsung could be bringing its larger 64GB option after all. However do expect to pay more for the added storage. According to a tipster, the Galaxy S6 64GB would be priced at RM3,099 while the Galaxy S6 edge 64GB will be priced even more at RM3,599. As comparison, the current Galaxy S6 and S6 edge in 32GB capacity are priced at RM2,599 and RM3,099 respectively. So in short, you’re paying RM500 extra for double the storage. From the looks of it, that’s a lot to pay for just 32GB extra considering Apple charges about RM424 for a 48GB jump from 16GB to 64GB with its  post-GST pricing . However this is partly due to Samsung’s Universal Flash Storage 2.0 that  performs much faster  than other eMMC 5.0 based storage. So far we dont know when it is going on sale but we are told that it is coming soon.  If you have RM3,099 at hand, would you go for a 64GB Galaxy S6 or a 32GB Galaxy S6 edge?"

The ZenFone 2 (ZE551ML) is also home to a massive 4GB RAM, 32GB storage as well as a 13 megapixel f/2.0 rear and 5 megapixel front camera combo and a large 3,000 mAh battery to boot. A larger 64GB storage version is also announced as well in today’s event.  Out of the box, it will run on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop with ZenUI 2.0 on top. The smartphone is incredibly thin at 3.9mm (at the thinnest point), making it quite literally one of the thinnest on the market. The Zenfone 2’s slightly cheaper sibling (ZE550ML) is a notch below with a 5.5″ 720p IPS display, 1.8GHz Z3560 quad-core processor and 2GB RAM under the hood. Both smartphones get an extra 5GB ASUS web storage. In terms of price, the high-spec ZenFone 2 ZE551ML with 4GB RAM is priced at 4,499,000 Rupiah (about RM1,266) for the 64GB storage version and 3,999,000 Rupiah (RM1,125) for the smaller 32GB unit. For a lower spec alternative with a Full HD display, the ZE551ML is also available with a 1.8GHz Z3560 Intel Atom processor, 2GB RAM and 16GB storage at 2,999,000 Rupiah (RM849). Meanwhile its lower spec ZE550ML with a 5.5″ HD 720p display and 16GB storage is going for 2,699,000 Rupiah (about RM757). These are the prices for the Indonesian market and we reckon the Malaysian pricing could be cheaper.  Other accessories have been announced as well including the View Flip Cover at 159,000 Rupiah (RM45), ZenEar S Headphones at 699,000 Rupiah (RM196) and ZenEar Headphones at 79,000 Rupiah (RM22). Their  ZenPower with 10,000mAh capacity  is going for 269,000 Rupiah (RM75). Also introduced is a couple of flash photography accessory such as the LolliFlash that plugs into the Zenfone 2’s audio jack at 119,000 Rupiah (RM33) and the ZenFlash at 239,000 Rupiah (RM67).  For those who cannot wait, you can pick up  the most powerful model  from grey importers at RM 1,299 (before GST). ASUS Malaysia will be launching the  Zenfone 2 officially in Malaysia  next month on 9th May."

As  teased earlier , the  Honor 6 Plus  will be coming to our shores, offering a large 5.5″ display in an affordable package. For those waiting for the replacement of its cheap and cheerful  Honor 3C , its new 5″ smart phone successor, the Honor 4C will be launched in Malaysia as well.  The first anniversary bash is happening on  28th April at KLCC . Head after the break on for more details of the two incoming smart phones.  The Honor 4C looks like a baby  Honor 4X , with a compact 5″ IPS HD 720p display. According to the Honor 4C  spec in Russia , it gets a similar 1.2GHz Octa-Core Kirin 620 processor with 2GB of RAM. It also gets 8GB of on-board storage that’s also expandable with microSD. Even the cameras are similar with a main 13MP rear camera and a front facing 5MP unit. Keeping the lights on is a 2,550mAh capacity battery, which is more than the Honor 3C’s 2,300mAh unit. Like the previous Honor 3C, it also support dual-SIMs but 4G LTE doesn’t seem to be listed. In Russia, the Honor 4C is priced at 8,990 Ruble (about RM609), while its bigger Honor 4X is priced at 11,990 Ruble (about RM813). With the current Honor 4X priced at RM619 (inclusive of GST), we wonder if Honor Malaysia could price their 4C at the same RM499 price point as the former Honor 3C.    If you want something with more grunt with a larger screen, the Honor 6 Plus is essentially the bigger brother of its current  Honor 6 . It features a larger 5.5″ Full HD display and underneath it runs on a high-spec 1.8GHz Octa-Core Kirin 925 processor with 3GB RAM along with expandable 32GB of storage. At the rear it gets dual 8MP main cameras while the front also features a 8MP selfie cam. Being a phablet device, it gets juiced up with a generous 3,600mAh capacity battery. The Honor 6 Plus supports dual-SIMs in 4G LTE.  To join the launch, you can sign up for a chance to win an invite over at  VMall.my ."

As promised by Xiaomi, the  Mi Note  is heading for Malaysia in Q2 and it has just passed certification with the model number 2015011. It supports dual-SIMs and most importantly it supports our local 1800MHz/2600MHz 4G LTE bands. The same device was also spotted in Singapore’s IDA database with the marketing name “Mi Note”. Meanwhile the 2nd device with the model  20140215  is none other than the  Mi 4  3G version. Which is quite surprising considering Xiaomi mentions that they have  no plans to bring the Mi 4  due to lack of full 4G LTE support especially the 2600MHz band that’s widely used in Malaysia.  To recap on the specs, the Mi Note standard version features a 5.7″ Full HD display, 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB RAM and comes with 16GB or 64GB of storage. It also gets a 13MP OIS main and a front facing 4MP camera. Keeping the lights on is a 3,000mAh capacity battery and overall it weighs 161 grams with a thickness of 6.95mm. You can check out our Mi Note first impressions and hands-on  here . For the Mi 4, it is quite similar except that it gets a 5″ Full HD display, a 13MP f/1.8 main camera and a front facing 8MP f/1.8 unit. In China, there are  several variations  of the Mi 4 available and looks like we are getting the Unicom 3G unit. Just recently, they have also announced a cheaper version which comes with 2GB RAM instead of 3GB. In this day and age, would you get a flagship without 4G LTE? Thanks  @Piratz  for the tip!

The event invite image shown above shows an Honor 6 Plus outline with a double camera lens at the back.  In addition, its likely  Honor 6 Plus product page  was spotted on Vmall.my but it is currently masked under the name “HonorBokeh”, which is referring to its symmetrical dual-camera technology.

It has a larger 5.5″ Full HD display and it runs on an upgraded Kirin 925 1.8GHz Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. There’s also a microSD slot which doubles up as a 2nd SIM slot.

This is their first major event that’s held outside of China, marking its significant commitment for international markets.  As we draw closer to its announcement even on 23rd April, Xiaomi has dropped a couple of vague clues of its upcoming smart phone. Without giving specifics, the new model could feature a bigger battery while maining a compact design. Design wise, it also implies a different craftsmanship and appearance despite looking the same.  From what we  gathered , the new device could be a  Mi 4i  which is an international variant of its current Mi 4 compact flagship. In terms of specs, the Mi 4i is spotted with a mid-range Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage. Display is likely to be a slightly smaller 4.9″ with Full HD resolution. Overall, this looks like a step back from its  Mi 4 , but if it gets a wider range of 4G LTE bands and a lower price tag, this could be a compelling mid-ranger that’s priced under RM1,000. This is good news for us Malaysians as the Mi 4  lacked 2600MHz LTE support  which is widely use here.

Huawei Malaysia has started a series of teasers in the past few days, rallying its fans to gather more people for a groufie. Without giving much details, Huawei Malaysia claims to be revealing something amazing today and we have a hunch that this is a new device. Fresh from last week’s  Huawei P8 announcement , this could be a hint of its Malaysian launch considering we are among the first wave of 30 countries to have it. From the 2 teasers, despite showing its current Ascend P7, there are some elements of the P8 including the light painted infinity sign and that  mystery hooded guy  from their official teaser. However its activity of getting people to take a group/wide selfie could be a contest to win special invites to a launch, which seems to be a thing these days for Chinese/Taiwanese brands. The P8 is the successor of the current Ascend P7 and it gets a more upmarket unibody metal design. The front gets a 5.2″ Full HD display and powering it is their in-house Kirin 930/935 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. For storage, it gets 16GB for its standard version and a much generous 64GB option for its Premium model. For taking pictures, it gets a 13MP camera which shoots in 4 colours (RGBW) instead of a conventional RGB set up. For the front, it gets an 8MP selfie shooter. Keeping the lights on is a 2,600mAh capacity battery and it maintains an impressive thickness of 6.4mm. Other than the P8, there’s a larger P8 Max phablet with a huge 6.8″ Full HD display. It has similar specs as the standard P8 but it gets a smaller 5MP front camera but a larger 4,360mAh capacity battery.

Like the recently announced  HTC One M9 , the Xperia Z4 looks similar to its predecessor model,  Xperia Z3  but it gets some incremental updates under the hood. The front retains the same 5.2″ display that does a full HD resolution of 1920×1080. Powering the device is Qualcomm’s top end 2.0GHz Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor that’s mated with 3GB of RAM. The on-board storage however gets an increase to 32GB and it has an expandable microSD slot that supports 128GB extra. As you would expect from a flagship Sony Xperia, it also gets water and dust resistance at IPX5/8, IP6X. For imaging, it retains the same 20.7MP BSI main camera with 25mm wide angle lens that supports 4K video recording but the front is now upgraded to a higher resolution 5MP camera. For its battery, it gets a smaller 2,950mAh non-removable unit (Z3: 3,200mAh) and as a result, it is much thinner at 6.9mm (Xperia Z3: 7.3mm) and weighs just 144 grams (Xperia Z3: 152g). Since the Xperia Z4 sticks to a standard Full HD resolution, it may still be able retain its famed “up to 2 days” of battery life.  For better group selfies, the front 5MP shooter also gets a 25mm wide angle lens and there’s even a digital image stabilisation for a more steadier shot. For those who love taking food pics, there’s a cooking mode to make your #foodporn pics more vibrant.  The build quality should be similar with its current Xperia Z3 with the use of rounded metal frames on each end. In terms of colours, it is available in White, Black, Copper and Aqua Green. Another welcome change is having an exposed microUSB port as what we’ve seen in the  earlier leaks . This makes charging easier without the hassle of a waterproof flap cover.

If you’re tired of manually copying WhatsApp database files, their new version now supports direct  cloud backup  with Google Drive integration.  At time of writing, it isn’t available officially on our  Google Play Store  but you may download the latest WhatsApp version 2.12.45 as  an APK download . After installing the latest version, you’ll notice a new Material Design UI and you can find the cloud storage backup feature under Settings > Chat Settings > Chat Backup. From here, you’ll need to associate a Google Drive account to WhatsApp. If you’re afraid of consuming your precious mobile data, you’re also able to set to backup over WiFi only. In terms of backup, WhatsApp would upload incremental updates after its initial upload. This means it will only backup subsequent bite size changes instead of the entire backup file periodically. You are able to set the frequency of the backup from daily, weekly or monthly. Only chat conversations and photos are saved, so you’ll still need to backup videos the old fashion way. The next time you install WhatsApp on a fresh smart phone, you’ll be asked if you have a Google Drive account to restore.  If you want to try it out now, you can download the latest APK file  here .

The P8 Lite should run on Emotion UI 3.1 on top of Android 5.0 at launch and is likely to have 4GLTE and dual SIM capabilities like it’s siblings. Under the hood you will have a 1.2GHz octa-core Kirin 620 chip like the Huawei Honor 4X, and it will run on 2GB RAM plus 16GB expandable storage via microSD slot. The phone will also be sporting a 720p screen, which is odd considering it should at the very least be 1080p given the screen size. As for the camera you will have a 13MP rear camera alongside a 5MP front snapper though there hasn’t been any mention of image stabilization or the sensor.

The current  Honor 6  is one of our favourite smart phones priced below RM1,000. Now it appears that its new Honor 7 sequel could be announced very soon.  From a couple of purported leaked shots, the new Honor flagships appears to have gone upmarket with a full unibody metal design. Also seen from the picture above is a fingerprint scanner mounted at the back. This looks quite similar with its current  Ascend Mate 7  phablet that features a one touch fingerprint scanner. Also visible is a dual-tone LED flash, which should provide more natural looking photos when flash is used.  In terms of specs, the Honor 7 is said to be having a 5.5″ Full HD display and powering the device is their latest Kirin 930/935 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board storage is mentioned to be 16GB and it should run on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop with Emotion UI 3.1.  For a 5.5 incher, we reckon this could be a Honor 7 Plus, like its current 5.5″ Honor 6 Plus phablet, while the actual Honor 7 would likely to maintain a more compact 5″ size. In another separate set of images, there’s also another device that carries a duo-camera set up at the rear. This could be a different model or yet another prototype of the new Honor flagship. With the usage of more market materials, the next Honor might probably be more expensive just like their latest P8. The Huawei P8 would  cost close to RM2,000  for its low spec model. This is quite a jump from the  Ascend P7  that was priced at RM1,499. Like any leaks, we recommend taking this with a pinch of salt.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Whenever your device needs to juice up, you can just leave it on a wireless charger without worrying about cables. For devices that doesn’t come with wireless charging built-in, the usual solution is to buy a wireless charging case or a cover with a charging coil built-in. Somehow the guys at Duracell think that’s too complicated so they have introduced something else instead.  What you’re seeing above is the Duracell micro USB Ring which houses the induction charger coil that can be plugged onto any device like a USB OTG thumb drive. While this sounds good for compatibility, the execution of it is rather flawed. To charge on the charging mat, you can probably imagine how impractical it is to position the ring on the wireless charger. Guess what, they actually thought of it and also included in this US$54 (about RM200) solution is a dummy stand so that it can support your device. In terms of support, it only supports PMA wireless charging which is different from the more popular Qi chargers that adopt WPC standards. Apparently its main company, P&G is a member of the Power Matters Alliance (PMA). A wireless charger that requires 3 separate components? We would rather stick to fast wired chargers any day.

Dropping its Ascend naming, the latest flagships now come in two sizes, the 5.2″ P8 and a larger 6.8″ P8 Max phablet. Both screens are still pushing Full HD 1080p resolution and powering the device is their in-house developed 64-bit Kirin 930/935 Octa-Core processor that boasts 2X the performance of its former Ascend P7.  With most brands focusing on premium design, Huawei has stepped up with a better crafted unibody metal design with a larger screen to body aspect ratio. Although the 5.2″ is big in size, it is roughly the same size as the 4.7″ iPhone 6. The P8 is still incredibly slim at 6.4mm while its larger P8 Max phablet has a respectably thin side profile at 6.8mm.  Its imaging capabilities take centre stage with what they claimed to be the world’s first 4-colour 13MP camera in RGBW format. For stable shots, it is also assisted by Optical Image Stabilisation that claims to tolerate shakes better at 1.2 degrees, which is double of the iPhone 6 Plus. There are a couple of camera tricks included which makes light painting a breeze with real time preview. For the front, it gets a 8MP selfie camera for the P8 and a 5MP shooter on the P8 Max. As usual, it also comes equipped with group selfie and beautification features.  There are a couple of new additions with the P8 including a new Knuckle Technology. This is basically a new gesture feature that lets you use your hand knuckles to draw or to crop images on the device. In terms of accessories, what we found interesting is an add-on 4.3″ E-ink display which is attached to the back of the device. This looks like an interesting alternative to the dual-screen YotaPhone.  Both P8 and P8 Max claims to provide more than a day’s worth of use on a single charge. The compact P8’s 2,600mAh capacity battery is rated to last 1.5 days on average or 1 day of heavy usage. Meanwhile the mammoth P8 Max with a huge 4,360mAh battery claims to push more than 2 days of use or 1.4 days for heavy duty users. To prolong its battery life, there are some software features like an App Firewall which blocks power hungry apps from running in the background. Out of the box, it runs on Android 5.0 with its custom Emotion UI 3.1. For each model, it comes with either standard or high-spec version  and fortunately Huawei is packing 3GB of RAM across the range. The only difference is storage where the P8 gets 16GB for standard and 64GB for the premium model. For the P8 Max, it starts with a minimum of 32GB storage for the standard and it doubles up to 64GB for the premium version. To distinguise the versions, the standard version comes in Titanium Grey and Mystic Champagne, while the Premium version gets Carbon Black and Prestige Gold colour options. The Huawei P8 is a dual-SIM 4G LTE device which comes with 2 nano-SIM slots. If you need more storage, the 2nd SIM slot can be used for microSD expansion. Connectivity shouldn’t be an issue as it supports a wide array of 4G LTE bands in FDD and TDD standards, while reception has been improved with a dual antenna design. For those who roam a lot, the device has a Roaming+ feature that allows it to connect to your roaming partner telco 3X quicker than other devices. In terms of price, the P8 standard version goes for 499 Euros (RM1958) and 599 Euros (RM2352) for the premium model. The larger 6.8″ Huawei P8 max is priced at 549 Euros (RM2155) for standard and 649 Euros (RM2548) for Premium.  Overall the P8 is quite a huge step up from its previous P7 flagship and this is quite obvious with its higher price tag. On the Ascend P7, the performance was quite disappointing from its Kirin 910T processor which pales in comparison to its affordable Honor 6 with Kirin 920. With its price tag touching the RM2,000 mark, Huawei believes they are now on par with the establishments in terms of build quality and performance. During the event, Huawei has mentioned that the new devices will be available first in 30 countries and good news for us, Malaysia is part of the list."

After what seems to be a  long wait , OnePlus is officially making its way into Malaysia, for real. In a forum post, the they have announced 22nd April as their official Malaysian launch date and you can buy the global  OnePlus One  units at their official  Malaysian site  (to be made live very soon). For loyal OnePlus forum members, they will be giving a special forum-only password where you can redeem an extra token of appreciation when you place your orders. After the launch, they will be organising another fan gathering on 24th of April. More details of the event will be shared within the next few days.  To recap on the specs, the One features a 5.5″ Full HD 1080p display and it runs on a 2.5GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM. The back gets a 13MP Sony IMX214 camera with 6 element f/2.0 lens while selfie shots are handled by its 5MP front camera. While the specs are similar with the OPPO Find 7 (sans Quad HD display), the battery isn’t replaceable but it gets a slightly larger 3,100mAh capacity battery. Overall it is 8.9mm thick and weighs 162 grams. Pricing wise, the 16GB version in Silk White is priced internationally at US$299 while the 64GB in Sandstone Black is priced at US$349. This roughly converts to RM1,100 and RM1,290 respectively before GST.  They didn’t mention how is the sale is going to be done and whether there’s an invite required before hand. Just last month, the OnePlus One had reappeared on SIRIM and was  certified  under Brightstar. For more info, it is probably best to check on their official  Facebook page .

It gets the same design and form factor as its bigger brother but comes in a smaller and lighter package. At the front, it gets a 10.8″ ClearType Full HD Plus display and it runs on Intel’s 1.6GHz Quad-Core Atom x7-Z8700 processor, which Microsoft claims to deliver 80% performance of an Intel Core i3 processor.  There are 2 models available with the base version having 2GB of RAM and 64GB storage priced at RM1,989 including of GST. If you need more, the higher spec 4GB RAM and 128GB storage version is going for RM2,389. For now it is a WiFi only device supporting 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.0. A 4G LTE version is said to be in the pipeline but Microsoft has yet to provide specific timelines for the Malaysian market. It also gets a front facing 3.5MP camera and a rear 8MP unit which both are capable of shooting Full HD 1080p resolution. In terms of options, the Surface 3 Type keyboard is sold separately at RM479 and it comes in choice of Black, Bright Blue and Red colours. If you plan to scribble, the Surface Pen which is also available in the same array of colours would cost you an extra RM189. There’s also a docking station for a full desktop experience with display, LAN and extra USB ports but it sets you back at RM769.  When compared to its larger Surface Pro 3, the Surface 3 is much lighter and thinner at 622 grams with a thickness of 8.7mm. The on-board battery is said to last 10 hours of video playback and for charging, it uses a more universal micro-USB port. So if you’re out of juice, you can easily charge using a power bank. Another key difference with the Surface Pro 3 is the kickstand, where it offers a fixed 3 step position. This according to Microsoft is done in order to reduce its thickness.  For the starting price of RM1,989, it does sound steep for a tablet. However with a full Windows 8.1 experience and the option to upgrade to Windows 10 when it is available, it is a step up for those who want a productivity tool in a compact tablet form factor. The price isn’t too bad considering the popular iPad Air 2 WiFi version is now  much more expensive  at RM2,045 for 64GB and RM2,384 for the 128GB version.  In our brief preview, it feels just as competent as a laptop and it should be good enough to handle all your web browsing, media viewing and office productivity needs. If you need more power for video editing, then you probably might want to consider its higher end Surface Pro 3 that comes with Core i3, i5 and i7 processor options.  If you’re interested, the Microsoft Surface 3 can be pre-ordered at the following links and stocks will be available for the general public on 5th May 2015. Aone Plus Supplies and Services

As reported earlier, ASUS was looking at developing a new watch with significant  battery life  and the new VivoWatch claims to offer up to 10 days of usage on a single charge.  For the new watch, details are quite scarce and the VivoWatch is said to be a fitness centric device which comes with heart rate and sleep monitoring capabilities. It also gets IP67 rated dust and water resistance, and it utilises a touch-enabled monochrome display that’s accompanied with an indicator light. Feature wise, you can expect it to be more basic than the original ZenWatch but its 10 days battery life puts it on par with Pebble’s new  Time Steel . From the looks of it, the extra long battery life was made possible with a energy efficient  proprietary operating system  instead of Android Wear.  As comparison, the first ZenWatch that runs on Android Wear gets just 1-2 days of battery life and unfortunately ASUS isn’t  bringing this  into Malaysia. So far ASUS has yet to reveal any pricing and availability details of the VivoWatch at the moment. Check out the VivoWatch in action after the break. [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

Now, five years later we have its 6th iteration, coming a long way from the original 4-inch smartphone when it was originally made as a direct competitor against the iPhone. The rest they say, is history. After that came the  Galaxy S2  the following year which nailed Samsung the Smartphone of the Year award at the Mobile World Congress Global Awards. Then came the  Galaxy S3  and  S4  which cemented Samsung in as the dominant smartphone maker in the Android market, with the S4 selling over 40 million units worldwide. Last year Samsung released the  Galaxy S5  with improved build quality and IP67 certification and considering the lackluster performance of the previous year’s flagship, they went back to the drawing board to create the  Galaxy S6  and  S6 edge  which are widely considered the best devices Samsung has ever built. They recently posted a video outlining these few years of growth that have led up to the current gen of phones. Check it out below."

The wipowerband’s high density polymer straps supposedly doubles the battery life of the Apple Watch but the data doesn’t have really anything to back it up. Apple would also need to approve the MagSafe charger at the back of the device on top of the wipowerband’s “Inductive tight couple” technology may not meet Apple’s standards. The wipowerband can be pre-ordered for $89 (About RM 329) for the 38mm case or $99 (RM 366) for the 42mm case and will be available in five striking colours.

So far only the standard Mi Note has went on sale in China and the Mi Note Pro has always been in the “coming soon” status without a definitive dateline. Before you dismiss the Mi Note Pro as vapourware, the high-end device with a golden frame has finally popped by China’s TENNA certification database with the model number 2015021. This indeed is the Mi Note Pro with a Quad HD display as well as support for 4G LTE in both TD-LTE and LTE FDD bands. Surprisingly it was also listed with a newer Android 5.0.2 for its operating system, which is similar to what we’ve seen for its upcoming  Mi 4i .  Spec wise, the Mi Note Pro gets a 5.7″ IPS Quad HD display and it runs on a Snapdragon 810 Octa-core processor instead of a Snapdragon 801 Quad-Core unit on the standard Mi Note. For on-board storage, it gets a single option of 64GB but it lacks a microSD slot for expansion. The back gets a 13MP f/2.0 OIS camera from Sony while the front gets a 4MP “Ultrapixel” camera. It also support dual-SIMs with 4G LTE and powering the device is a 3,000mAh capacity battery with support for quick charging. With the certification out of the way, Xiaomi would be pushing to sell the Mi Note Pro in China anytime now. In terms of price, it is going for 3,299 CNY which is RM1,967 in our current exchange rates. Xiaomi says that the Mi Note would be coming to Malaysia in Q2 this year and if all else fails, you can probably pick up one from the guys at  DirectD  shortly after its debut sale in China.

Though you might want to note that the phones have Corning Gorilla Glass on the front and back so only the rim is getting the gold treatment as well as the bit around the camera module. Karalux claims that it takes them about three hours for their engineers to pass the phone through the ten stages of plating to get it 24K gold layered on top of an extra nano layer to ensure it doesn’t get corroded.

The company’s first foray into audio was with their  Piston  in-ear earphones, of which the second generation Piston was launched not too long ago sporting the same styling as the Mi Headphones. The Piston is priced very cheaply too at RM 50, following Xiaomi’s tradition of having insanely cheap prices. Aside from the headphones, you also get a hard carrying case on top of a microfiber drawstring bag, which is a plus point considering a lot of headphones at this price tends to get a soft pouch at very best. The headphones also comes with a 3.5mm airplane adaptor, 1.4m Kevlar braided audio cable with volume control which terminates in a 3.5mm jack and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm gold plated adaptor. The audio cable also features a microphone behind the volume control as the headset is designed for mobile users, so it can be used to take calls as well. I don’t entirely like how the headset features a dual-wire design because it feels rather cluttered, but they can at least be removed for storage. To top it off, you get not one but three replaceable ear cushion kits which consist of an on-ear foam cushion, on-ear soft cushion and finally an over-ear soft cushion configuration which are made for different listening styles. For this review we are using the on-ear soft cushion only, but how’s that for a whole lot of kit?"

The event is going to be huge as Xiaomi’s CEO Lei Jun, President Bin Lin and VP for Xiaomi Global Hugo Barra would be there as well.  Its tagline “i is coming” is still a huge question mark. Could this be a new product range that’s different from the standard Mi and Redmi series? Following the Redmi 2 and the Mi Note, we are guessing this could be a replacement of the Redmi Note which is due for a replacement. We’ll be at New Delhi for the launch, so follow us on  Twitter  and  Facebook  for the latest coverage. [  SOURCE  ]"
Sponsored,Samsung went back to the drawing board to create the most beautiful smartphone they’ve ever made,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/10/samsung-went-back-to-the-drawing-board-to-create-the-most-beautiful-smartphone-theyve-ever-made/,"Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Design,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-04-10,"This post is brought to you by the Samsung Galaxy S6 & Galaxy S6 edge – Created from the ground up, defines What’s Next. The Galaxy S series is now in its 6th year and Samsung has come a long way since its original Galaxy S  launched  in 2010. At the time, it had set a new standard for a high-end Android flagship with a thin design, incredible Super AMOLED display and top notch internals.  No doubt the past few Galaxy S flagships have gotten better in hardware but its plastic build is not doing much justice to its capable performance. They have tried to make their smart phones feel more upmarket with the use of chrome and faux leather finishing, but that’s simply not enough to deliver a true premium feeling device. With today’s users demanding for more, Samsung has gone back to the drawing board for its latest Galaxy S6 flagship. Called as Project Zero, the new model was built from the ground up aspiring to create what’s next now and hopefully to set a new standard of smart phone design. The exterior has to be as top notch to reflect its new advancements on the inside. To deliver a premium experience, the first contact with the device is crucial. On the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, they have went with glass and metal as their core materials. For a more cutting edge design, the Galaxy S6 edge stands out as the world’s first device to feature a dual curve display. To create this is not an easy task and Samsung has used a unique 3D Thermoforming technology to create a double curve design for its front panel. Meanwhile for its back panel, the use of glass isn’t entirely new. To allow the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge stand out, they have used a nano-thin multi coating process to give its back panels a vibrant and dynamic finish. This creates an illusion of flowing metal and the way it reflects natural light is stunning at various angles.  The Gold Platinum variant appears more vibrant than other typical gold smart phones while the Emerald Green colour is unique which you can’t find on any other premium device.  For a comfortable and an upmarket feel, the latest flagship uses a sleek metal frame which undergoes diamond cutting and anodizing processes for a more refined feel. The result is a surrounding frame that’s smooth to touch and it feels reassuring to hold in the hands. The frames are not the same across the range as each colour will get a different shade of colour for a unique look. To protect the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge from daily scuffs and bumps, Samsung has used the latest Gorilla Glass 4 which is thinner, lighter and more damage resistant than its predecessors. For its body, a high strength aluminium that’s similarly used for aircrafts and automobile is being used. Samsung claims that it is 1.5X stronger and 1.2X more scratch resistant than other aluminium used on other smart phones today. Of course, usability isn’t sacrificed for beauty entirely. They have retained its right side mounted power button for better single handed use while its volume controls are placed conveniently on the left with individual up and down buttons. For greater sound, the speaker grill has been repositioned to the bottom, which produces 1.5X louder sound than the previous Galaxy S5. 
The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge will be available in Malaysia on 17th April 2015. The Galaxy S6 is available in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Blue Topaz, while the Galaxy S6 edge comes in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, Gold Platinium and Green Emerald."
soyacincau,Xiaomi’s next smart phone to be called the Mi 4i?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/11/xiaomis-next-smart-phone-to-be-called-the-mi-4i/,,,2015-04-11,"Xiaomi is announcing a  new global smart phone  in India on the 23rd of April. This is quite unusual for Xiaomi as they have been launching all of their key products in their home ground, China. Until now there’s hardly any clues on the new model except for its teaser that says the “ i is coming “. From some clues we’ve gathered, the upcoming device could be called the Mi 4i. We can’t confirm right now but this might be an international variant of its current  Mi 4  with support for wider 4G LTE bands. On Singapore’s IDA (Infocomm Development authority) database, a new Xiaomi smart phone with the model 2015015 was recently certified and it carries a marketing name of “Mi 4i”. This comes right after the recent  Redmi 2  smart phone that  went on sale  in Singapore and Malaysia last month. When we searched further, the Mi 4i had also  appeared  on GeekBench 3 with Qualcomm 64-bit Octa-Core processor clocked at 1.65GHz along with 2GB of RAM. In terms of performance, it showed an average score of 473 for single-core and 1422 for multi-core which isn’t much better from a Redmi Note 4G. Of course, these are pre-launch figures and what’s interesting is that it was running on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. As you probably know, the  Mi 4  isn’t coming officially into Malaysia and the Mi 4i (if that’s the actual name) could be alternative that you’ve been waiting for. In terms of specs, it appears to be a notch below the Mi 4 with possibly a Snapdragon 615 processor (instead of Snapdragon 801) that’s mated to 2GB of RAM (instead of 3GB).  However with Lollipop out of the box, this could be an interesting contender if it is priced below RM1,000. Since it is launching in India, it has to be compelling enough to compete with the likes of Micromax. We’ll find out more in 2 weeks time. [  SOURCE   2  ]"

These new images had appeared from a purported  staging site  that was discovered ahead of launch. Like what we’ve seen from its  teaser , the new G4 will be having several leather back options that comes with thread stitching details in the middle. This looks like real leather and it should be more premium feeling than the faux leather execution on the past Galaxy Note series. Apart from the leather back series, there are also standard LG G4 with a more glossy back cover.   The staging microsite isn’t accessible right now but according to the sources that managed to see them, the specs and features are mostly temporary placeholders. The specs listed were incorrect including a 13MP camera and an older Android 4.4 KitKat operating system, which are likely carried forward from the LG G3 spec sheet.  From what has been  confirmed  so far, the LG G4 will be having a 16MP camera with a larger f/1.8 aperture lens. Meanwhile the front will get a higher 8MP camera for better selfies. Out of the box, it would be running on Android 5.0 Lollipop with their new LG UX 4.0. What do you think of the LG G4’s design? Leave your comments below. [  SOURCE ,  2  ]"

The Liquid Z410 will also have dual sim 4G LTE capabilities as well as Acer’s UI which they claim has customised profiles and UI for “users aged 7 to 70″.

This time, a test to determine if the latest flagships can withstand drops on the back and on the sides. This Galaxy S6 edge should be more prone to damage but Gorilla Glass 4 seems to be holding pretty well for direct impacts on the sides. The Samsung official drop test video appears to be too conservative for dropping only from chest height. For something more extreme, someone had did a drop test of the  S6 edge versus the iPhone 6  at various heights. The double curve display phone has surprisingly managed to withstand the impact better than the metal clad iPhone 6 Plus.  Watch the official drop test video after the break.  [  SOURCE  ]"

Dell has just announced its new Venue 10 7000 Android tablet, which is a full sized version of its wafer thin  Venue 8 7000 . In terms of design, it gets a rounded hinge that’s similar to Lenovo Yoga 2 Tablet series. While it doesn’t have a flip out kickstand for various modes, the hinge on the Venue 10 7000 lets you attach a backlit keyboard which lets you tilt the tablet screen around up to 180 degrees.  Spec wise, the Venue 10 features a 10.5″ Super AMOLED display that does 2560×1600, which is similar to  Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S 10.5 . Under the hood, it gets an Quad-Core 2.33GHz Intel Atom Z3580 processor with 2GB of RAM along with a choice of 16GB or 32GB on-board storage options. At the back, it has a main 8MP shooter and an array of Intel RealSense cameras like its predecessor which more depth information and selective focus after a picture is taken.  While the Venue 8 is the thinnest tablet at 6.0, the larger Venue 10 7000 is slightly thicker at 6.2mm. It houses a 7,000mh capacity battery that’s rated to last about 7 hours and that makes it heavier at 598 grams while its 8.4″ Venue 8 weighs just 305 grams. The Dell Venue 8 7000 is priced at US$499 (about RM1815), putting it head to head with the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 Pro. For a full productivity set up, it will cost US$629 (about RM2,280) with the backlit keyboard. It ain’t cheap and Dell is targeting the device for top level corporate executives.

Having a postpaid plan gives you the ultimate freedom to use. There’s no credits to top up and you would only need to pay at the end of your monthly bill cycle. However that also opens up a possibility of bill shocks for something which you thought you never use.  By now you’ve probably heard stories of people raking up bills of thousands of ringgit due to accidental data usage or simply for roaming on the wrong network.  Operator Maxis wants to change the way people look at Postpaid especially where there’s a stigma that the operators are all out to get you. Recently they made some drastic changes from the way they charge for calls and data as well as making internet usage overseas cheaper and worry free.  Is it just lip service or have they actually made a difference? Read on to find out. For those using the old classic postpaid plans, most customers would have switched to a brand new smart phone but still hasn’t gotten a dedicated data plan. Usually by default, Mobile Data is switched on and telcos would usually charge a rather expensive Pay As You Go rate of 10 sen per 10KB. That’s RM10 per MB and can you imagine how much would it cost if you watched a couple of YouTube videos? Since last year, they have  gotten rid  of its old Pay As You Go Rates with a more simplified mechanism. For every 50MB you use, Maxis charges just RM10 for each block. So if you use 80MB, you’re charged only RM20 (2 x 50MB blocks). The best part is that Maxis caps your usage to 250MB at RM50/month so you won’t be charged beyond that. Of course, your speeds would be throttled down but you can always subscribe to a data plan to regain your speed. Also if you accidentally enabled Mobile Data, Maxis will not charge if you don’t use beyond 250KB in a single month. This is just another safety net for those who just want to stick to WiFi for their smart phone internet needs.  When using mobile data on Maxis, they will constantly remind you especially if you don’t have a plan. If you’re using a data-less plan like Maxis TalkMore, you’ll receive a message that you’re on their Mobile Internet Plan of RM10 per 50MB.  Once you’ve started using, they will keep reminding you each time you utilised a block of 50MB along with a quick update of your usage. In our test, we got a total of 7 SMS from start until hitting 250MB, so you definitely can’t miss it. Each SMS also comes with a tip that you would save more if you subscribe to a data plan by dialling *100#. You can top up from as little as RM2/day for 100MB to RM48/month for 1GB.  Want to know how much you’ve used before your bill arrives? With the newly revamped  MyMaxis App , you can always check your unbilled amount and remaining data quota in real time. If need to use a lot of data at one go especially when you use your smart phone as a WiFi hotspot, you can always top up RM2 for 100MB or RM5 for 500MB from the app. Alternatively you can do this by dialing *100#. When making a trip overseas, staying in touch has never been easier. Upon arrival at a new country, you are likely to be bombarded with SMS, telling you the best network operator to roam. Switching networks manually can be a hassle and there are cases where your smart phone would jump to a different network, which could result a very expensive roaming bill. Fortunately Maxis has gotten rid of such complications and they would guarantee that you will always be connected to the right network.  For a worry free travel, Maxis offers  Unlimited Data Roam  (Fair Usage Applies) for only RM38/day at over 106 countries. If you want something more affordable for basic Instant Messaging, there’s a cheaper DataRoam Saver at 15 countries for only RM10/day. While DataRoam saver comes with just 50MB high speed quota per day, there’s no extra charge once you’ve exceeded. To activate, just dial *100# upon arrival before enabling Data Roaming on your smart phone.  Another good reason to roam on Maxis is that you can overcome the Great Firewall in China. So instead of getting a local SIM where you’re unlikely to access Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, you still can share your moments without restrictions on Maxis. This is possible since it reroutes your internet traffic through Malaysia.  Oh by the way, for MaxisOne Plan customers (MaxisOne Plan/One Plan Lite/Business One Plan/Business One Plan Lite), Maxis is giving  free calls while roaming  at selected countries. This is applicable from now until 30th April.  For the ultimate Worry Free experience, why not give  MaxisOne Plan  a try? For a flat RM128/month, the MaxisOne Plan offers unlimited domestic calls and SMS and 2GB of mobile internet. If you exceed your internet quota, there’s no extra charge and this means there’s no way for you to exceed RM128/month. The only way to incur more charges is if you make the following: For a more affordable alternatives, there’s also MaxisOne Plan Lite at RM78/month and MaxisOne Plan Start at RM58/month. Both offers unlimited calls and SMS but only within the Maxis/Hotlink network. For internet, they come with 1GB and 100MB respectively each month. The 5 claims mentioned here are part of Maxis  0 bill shock promise . Like most products in the market, you probably wonder if there’s any catch or hidden conditions. The word “unlimited” has been overused and there’s always a tingling sensation that there’s a hidden charge somewhere.  For the next few days, we will be rigorously testing out its Mobile Data worry free promise and we’ll find out if their MaxisOne Plan truly offers bottomless calls and SMS. Stay tuned for our findings."

You’ve diligently ranked the pictures and we’ve tabulated the results, and here they are. Based on your votes, it looks like the Galaxy Note Edge is a favourite, consistently ranked in the top three. The iPhone 6 and the Xperia Z3 didn’t fare well with both devices being ranked at the bottom two in most of the tests. Having the same camera hardware as the Note Edge, the Galaxy S6 received also ranked well among our readers. When it comes to camera performance, the Galaxy Note Edge is  among the best  you can get. In this test, you can see that it performed well in almost every condition, especially in challenging lighting conditions, as you can see in the Set 4. While the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge has the same camera hardware as the Note Edge (and  Note 4 ), it looks like the Note Edge is slightly better optimised to produce better pictures overall. To be honest, we expected a lot from the iPhone 6 but in this test, it was ranked poorly in all but one of the sets, which is disappointing. Despite being a generation behind in terms of hardware, the Galaxy S5 did ok in this test. The Xperia Z3 however, failed to shine and is outclassed by its competitors. So what do you think?

Fresh from  MWC 2015 , they are likely to introduce its new  Lumia 640  and  Lumia 640 XL . Its most affordable entry-level  Lumia 430  could be making an appearance as well based on the recent sightings in our Malaysian SIRIM database. The Lumia 640 and 640 XL are quite similar in terms of specs. Both are having a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor that’s mated to 1GB of RAM and has 8GB of expandable storage. What sets both of them apart is the screen size where the Lumia 640 gets a 5″ HD 720p display while the XL has a larger 5.7″ screen that also pushes the same HD 720p resolution.  Apart from the screen size, the cameras are different too. The smaller Lumia 640 gets a 8MP main + 1MP front camera combo, while its bigger XL version packs a 13MP camera at the back and larger 5MP unit for better selfies. Powering both devices is a 2,500mAh battery for the 640 and a phablet category 3,000mAh capacity for the 640 XL. Meanwhile the Lumia 430 is seen as a tweaked version of its current Lumia 435. It gets a modest 4″ 800×480 display and a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon 200 prcessor, 1GB RAM and 8GB of expandable storage. Imaging is rather low rate with a main 2MP camera and a basic VGA shooter for the front. The only difference with the Lumia 435 is the battery where it gets a smaller 1,500mAh capacity battery. The Lumia 640 and Lumia 640 XL are expected to be priced between RM500-RM900 range. Meanwhile the entry-level Lumia 430 could be priced below RM300, which is their most affordable Windows device. From the looks of it, the 640 XL could come in 2 versions – 3G and 4G LTE which both supports dual-SIMs.  Lumia 640, 640XL, 430 Certification"
soyacincau,Compared: Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/10/compared-samsung-galaxy-s6-vs-iphone-6/,"Comparison,iPhone 6,iPhone 6 Malaysia,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6","iPhone,Mobile Devices,Samsung",2015-04-10,"Think of a flagship smart phone, and both  Galaxy S6  and  iPhone 6  should pop up on your consideration list right now. The iPhone 6 despite its premium price tag is still commanding a huge chunk of the smart phone market share. In the last quarter of 2014, the Cupertino company had  sold more iPhones than Samsung’s  extensive smart phone line up.  Fast forward to Q2 2015, the latest flagship from Samsung has up the ante with better hardware and more attention to build quality and design than it did before. So if you’re in the market to get a high-end smart phone, which would you take? We outline the differences between the two and hopefully you can get a better idea of what to get.  Let’s start with the numbers. In terms of price, the Galaxy S6 has gone up significantly from its predecessor but it is still cheaper than the base iPhone 6 with 16GB storage that’s priced at RM2,702. For RM2,599, the Galaxy S6 offers double the storage at 32GB but this time it lacks a microSD card slot and a removable battery.  With a 5.1″ Quad HD display, the Galaxy S6 is bigger than the iPhone 6 but it is thinner by a tiny bit at 6.8mm versus the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm. With an all glass and metal body, the Galaxy S6 is slightly heavier by 9 grams. No doubt the screen on the Galaxy S6 is awesome with incredibly high pixel density but for this size, not many would be able to tell the difference between a 326ppi and 577ppi display. As a result, despite having a much larger 2,550mAh capacity battery, the Galaxy S6 battery life isn’t too far off from the iPhone 6 (1,810mAh), which means you’ll probably need to charge it before the sun sets if you’re a heavy duty user.  Meanwhile for the main camera, the S6 doubles the megapixel count (16MP vs 8MP) compared to the iPhone 6. For low light imaging, the Galaxy S6 aces with a larger f/1.9 aperture lens, while the iPhone 6 settles for f/2.2 for both sides. It is interesting to note that the iPhone 6 comes with dual-LED flash which should provide more natural lighting if required. The Galaxy S6 camera is pretty impressive and it take shots instantly with no hesitations. Don’t just take our word for it. In our recent blind camera test,  most of our readers picked  the Galaxy S6 over the iPhone 6 for better pictures.  In terms of added features, the Galaxy S6 now comes with a single touch fingerprint scanner, which unlocks instantly just like the iPhone 6’s Touch ID. The Galaxy S6 is also faster to charge with its adaptive fast charger (0-50% in 30 minutes) and you have the added convenience of wireless charging as well. On paper, logically, the Galaxy S6 is more worth for your money considering it offers more for less on the spec sheet list. With Samsung’s new 14nm Exynos 7420 processor, you can expect best in class performance and it shows from the benchmarks. It crushes other smart phones by a mile but it is interesting to note that the iPhone 6 aces in the Single Core test under GeekBench.  Samsung Galaxy S6 
 iPhone 6 
 Numbers aside, the experience is what matters. Despite what you see on the spec sheet and benchmark numbers, you can hardly fault the iPhone 6 for its sheer smoothness even after prolonged usage. For now, the Galaxy S6 is buttery smooth and we felt that its new TouchWiz UI is more refined, but of course others would argue it isn’t skimmed down enough for a true stock Android experience.  When the Galaxy S6 first came out, many had accused it of being a copy but  we don’t think so . While the metal frame, audio jack and grilled speaker grill looks similar, the Galaxy S6 stands out with a different colour treatment on its glass body. Even the Gold Platinum colour looks more shimmering than the Gold version of the iPhone 6.  The button placements for both devices are similar with the volume controls on the left, while the power/wake button is placed on the right.  It all boils down to your preference. If you want the very latest device, a great camera and what we feel is better looking device right now, the Galaxy S6 is probably the one you should be considering. However for those who prefer a more simplified experience, the iPhone 6 has been a defacto choice and it has been able to hold on to its selling price very well since its launch in Malaysia in November last year. Furthermore, the iOS experience is more smooth and refined due to its closed ecosystem. Besides, Apple has greater control over both hardware and software. While the Galaxy S6 will eventually get newer Android updates, it is likely to take longer time compared to its Apple counterpart.  Samsung has worked from scratch to deliver a premium product which finally can be on the same league as HTC and Apple in terms of build quality. Probably the biggest Achilles heel is Samsung’s two flagships per year cycle where a newer Note will emerge late this year. Like most devices, you can expect the price start to plummeting when something new is around the corner. If you don’t intend of changing phones that often, resale value shouldn’t be much a concern. We know that there are people who take resale value very seriously and it is taken as an indicator of perceived premium and demand. Time will tell if this aspired perception would be a reality in the long run. Which would be the ultimate flagship choice? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.

The LG G4 is confirmed to have a  5.5″ Quad HD IPS LCD  display that’s similar to the current  LG G3  but the new generation display boasts better contrast ratio and increased brightness of up to 30%. In terms of hardware, it was  speculated  that the G4 would use a  Qualcomm Snapdragon 808  Hexa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. The main camera is likely to be a 16MP shooter that’s further assisted by Optical Image Stabiliser.  For u folks in Malaysia, the future of LG’s mobile business is still a  question mark  and until now there’s no visibility if they would offer the  LG G Flex 2  which was announced in January.

To drum up more interest ahead of launch, they have just released its teaser video which doesn’t tell much about the device. Instead it features a mysterious guy walking around stealing lights from everyone he passes by. This could be an indication of better low light camera capabilities. From its  initial leaks , the new P8 would still feature its iconic slim design with a metal frame design which could be 6.6mm thick. In terms of specs, it is likely to carry a more compact 5.2″ screen that does Full HD and powering it is a newer Kirin 935 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. From what we’ve experienced with the latest Honor smart phones, Huawei’s in-house Kirin processor are getting more competent to give the more established processors like Qualcomm a run for their money. Like the new Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, it could come with 32GB of on-board storage and a possible 2,600mAh capacity battery that boasts longer battery life with better power management.

soyacincau,Prepaid Reloads and GST: What you need to know,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/06/prepaid-reloads-and-gst-what-you-need-to-know/,"Ahmad Maslan,gst,gst malaysia,GST Top Up,Malaysia Prepaid,Malaysia Prepaid Tax,prepaid,Prepaid Reload,Prepaid Reload GST,Prepaid Top up GST,Sales Tax",Industry in General,2015-04-06,"The implementation of  GST  in Malaysia has caused a stir for prepaid users as there was confusion on the extra 6% tax on top ups/reloads. To make things clear, 6% GST will be applied to  all telco services  whether it is postpaid or prepaid with the exception of international roaming charges. So if you’re buying a RM10 top up, you have to pay RM10.60 and a RM50 top up would cost you RM53. There’s no running away from it at the moment.  As consumers were caught unaware of the new charges, things got more confusing when Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Haji Ahmad Maslan declared that there  shouldn’t be any price increase of prepaid reloads . You can probably imagine the chaos at phone shops and convenience stores nationwide. Even some shops were reported to stop selling prepaid reloads as they had gotten fed up with justifying the added charges.  With growing number of  complaints  (815 on the first day), the Communication and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) had came out to clear the air that the 6% GST will indeed be added to the reload price. Below are the main pointers: So what was our Deputy Finance Minister ranting about when GST was clear cut? The answer actually lies on the old Services Tax which was applicable all these while. This is the same as the 6% service tax that’s imposed on our monthly postpaid bills. Datuk Haji Ahmad Maslan explained that there’s no price difference for consumers as GST replaces the Services Tax directly. What actually happened is that all telcos have been absorbing the 6% services tax. The tax was imposed in accordance to the Service Tax Act 1975 since the beginning of prepaid and they had tried to  pass the buck back to consumers  in 2011. Unfortunately for them, that didn’t happen as it faced  strong opposition  from several parties. With the introduction of GST, this was the  window of opportunity  for telcos to stop absorbing the 6% which they have doing for years.  All prepaid reloads would cost 6% more and all telcos have agreed to give an extra value add such as free voice call minutes and SMS for each top up to cushion the increase cost. However MCMC will be  conducting a survey  to determine if reloads are better sold at the old price but with GST included. So instead of paying RM10.60 for a RM10 reload, they would be selling a RM10 reload with RM9.43 value after GST. That would also make payments easier as you won’t need to fumble over spare change for the extra 6%. What do you guys think? Share your thoughts in the comments below."

To assure that its latest  Galaxy S6  and  Galaxy S6 edge  are strong enough to withstand normal day to day abuses, they have  responded  with a statement and an official video. According to Samsung, the test conducted by Square Trade puts excessive amount of pressure on a single point that’s beyond the normal case scenario. They added that the usual force if a person presses on the back pocket is about 66 pounds (30kg). This is subtly referring to the iPhone 6 Plus which was reported to have bent in pockets.  In the video, Samsung have tested both the S6 and S6 edge with 79 pounds (32kg) of pressure which is equivalent to the force of snapping 5 pencils once go. Surprisingly, Samsung has urged Square Trade to retest again for both front and back sides of the device for a more accurate representation. Not sure how would that change anything as Square Trade kept applying pressure until its breaking point while Samsung stopped at its own 81 pounds limit. We are pretty sure the Galaxy S6 edge would eventually get bent under a pressure machine. Watch the official bend test video after the break. [  SOURCE  ]"

But what if you could totally ditch the wires? Previously you would have still needed a separate wireless charging back cover plus a charging pad to make this happen, but Samsung has ditched this entirely in favour of sticking it directly into the phones themselves. The  Samsung Galaxy S6  and  Galaxy S6 edge  has inbuilt wireless charging with fully embedded WPC (Wireless Power Consortium) and PMA (Power Matters Alliance) certified wireless charging standards; which puts them at a different standard compared to all the cable dependant smartphones out there. Of course, the engineers over at Samsung didn’t want to cut corners on power or add to the bulk of the new devices so the wireless charging coil needed to be as small as possible to keep the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge as skinny as can be. If you want to get technical, the component is just 0.27mm thick, 1/3 the thickness of the same part present in the Samsung GALAXY S5’s wireless charging cover; or in other words, so fine that you’re not even aware it is there. They’ve also added two extra layers of magnetic shielding to keep leakages at bay so it’s completely safe. So do you have to get an official wireless charging pad? Not necessarily, as the aforementioned wireless charging capabilities will also work with any wireless pad that meets WPC, PMA standards and any wireless charger with Qi should work fine too. This is also thanks to Samsung’s efforts increase efficiency and minimize the involved charging hardware components. Did you know that Samsung and IKEA are working together to make wireless charging more accessible? By incorporating  wireless charging technology  into furnishings like lamps, bedside tables and desks, you effectively can have a charging spot in any part of your house. Convenient! Everyone has a busy schedule right? And our devices are usually such energy vampires that we can barely spare the time to get a good charge going, and if you forget that’s the end of you. The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge have that covered, besides not having to tangle with your cables, they charge a good 1.5 times faster than their predecessor. Based on Samsung’s own internal tests, you can get up to an average of four hours of usage from a quick 10 minutes charge. This is extremely useful when you are left with just a short time to refuel your phone. 
  Having efficient hardware isn’t enough if there’s nothing to keep an eye on things. As such, the devices will have a Smart Manager application keeping tabs on your smartphone and apps to let you manage your juice more effectively. Just a tap and you can easily manage battery usage and keep your Samsung smartphone frosty for longer; thanks to Samsung’s great innovations in charging technology."

soyacincau,The Galaxy S6 edge bends but is it something to worry about?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/05/the-galaxy-s6-edge-bends-but-is-it-something-to-worry-about/,"bend gate,Bend Test,Bendgate,bending Galaxy S6 edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge bend test","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-04-05,"6 months after the  iPhone 6 Plus bendgate  became the trending topic, the “Bending” question is still a question for every new device in the market. Square Trade, a company that specialises on mobile protect plans have put 3 devices – the  iPhone 6 Plus , the  HTC One M9  and the double curve  Galaxy S6 edge  on a pressure machine.   How well does the Galaxy S6 edge perform against its metal body rivals? Watch the video after the break. From the test, the S6 edge bends at 110 pounds (49.8kg) of pressure similar to the iPhone 6 Plus. Meanwhile the new HTC One M9 bends at a slightly higher 120 pounds (54kg) and this also marks its end of the road as the power/wake button had failed to work, rendering the device unusable. Continuing to apply pressure on both the S6 edge and iPhone 6 Plus, the S6 edge was completely destroyed at 149 pounds (67kg) while the iPhone 6 Plus could withstand a little more at 179 pounds (81kg).  Is it a cause of concern? For the most of us, probably not unless your day to day usage would undergo such insane amount of pressure. But here’s the thing to remember. The bendgate issue started because of initial complaints that the iPhone 6 Plus had bent under reported normal use like leaving it in a pocket. This was further exaggerated when it got bent with  bare hands .  Apple didn’t ignore this and they had  acknowledged  9 official complaints during its initial release. From the looks of it, Apple appears to be strengthen its iPhone 6 Plus for its newer batch as Consumer Reports had  done a similar test  before where it starts to deform at a lower 90 pounds (40kg).  Interestingly they didn’t test the normal Galaxy S6 version which comes with a flat metal frame cross the sides, which in theory should perform better. For the S6 edge display to crack first is pretty much expected since it wraps around the entire front surface. While most devices could still work from minor accidental drops, it is always advisable to buy a case if you intend of keeping them scuff free.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

As we already know  the 6% GST will also be applied to mobile devices like tablets, smartphones, certain apps as well as other telecommunication products and services. But what people don’t know is that mobile communications services have already had a 6% service tax on postpaid services to begin with of which will be replaced by the 6% GST. How much of a change this will incur is still up to debate but it shouldn’t change too much for the postpaid, broadband and data users. The price of prepaid services and corresponding airtime for SIM Packs, Starter Packs and Reload Coupons will be maintained but as part of GST accordance telcos are required to charge 6% GST on top of these prices but all international roaming charges are not subject to GST as they are classified as a zero-rated supply.

Not only it packs more powerful hardware underneath but they have finally made a device that looks and feels more upmarket than anything they have produced before.  With both models hitting Malaysian shelves very soon, we managed to get the Galaxy S6 edge for a long term use. Is the Galaxy S6 edge as good as the hype? Read on to find out. Samsung has always been known for its plasticky build even on its flagship models. In each sequel, they had tried almost everything from using faux leather to rubbery textures to make plastic feel more expensive. For the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, you can leave your old perceptions behind as Samsung has finally taken premium materials and design more seriously.  The two Galaxy S6 models are made mostly from glass and metal. Finally it is something on par with its rival iPhone 6 and HTC One M8 in terms of build quality. While the usage of glass isn’t entirely new, they have made the appearance look more stunning and unique with a range of vibrant new colours. In the hands, the back of the device looks like flowing metal and it reflects light beautifully under various angles. This has got to be the best looking smart phone that Samsung has ever made."

The ultimate cooking companion, the BLADE edge also comes with all of the Samsung Galaxy S6’s premium build and tech but has such a sharp edge it can be used as a chef’s knife, so much so it could very well render all the other knives in your kitchen obsolete. All the components were redesigned to fit into the curve of the smartphone never seen before anywhere else, with a brand new U4CF (Ultra 4D Curved Flash) memory technology that betters the previous 3D vertical stacking techniques by introducing 10nm-wide wormholes that send data to a far-away cloud. These wormholes also result in a distorted physique, giving the NAND flash memory solution a curved shape. Equipped with a razor-sharp diamond edge, the phone even takes inspiration from the sparkling stone, with a stunning diamond-cut finish on it’s tough ceramic body that’s capable of cutting through lobster tail and can even slice through tender tomatoes. What’s more, the smartphone is not just built from ergonomic ceramic but it’s fire AND waterproof too! The BLADE edge also features a set of sensors and algorithms that will analyze grip, dexterity and strength to help make your cutting up to 50% faster than with conventional knives and has a special feature for slicing fruit and dicing veggies. And don’t worry about how sharp it is, with KNOX Security you’ll never get a cut again. Scan your finger on the home button and the Blade will retract it’s edge! it even has a human blood sensor that will automatically place an emergency call to the authorities if it were used in violent or criminal situations. If you accidentally make a call all you have to do is scan your fingerprint, swipe the security pattern, punch in the 15-digit password and sing along to the random-selected song from your most recent Milk Music station and the call will be cancelled. KNOX’s powerful anti-virus protection will also alert you to germs in your food or cooking setup on top of protecting from online threats and viruses. To add on to the value of this cutting edge device, the Galaxy BLADE edge comes with a S-Thermometer stylus that doubles as a wireless meat thermometer and baking tool so you know when your roast is cooked to perfection. The smartphone will come with a slew of charging-and-cutting blocks as well as customiseable handles where you can choose from Olivewood to even Mammoth tusk for that premium feel. So what are you waiting for? this is an edge you definitely don’t want to miss. [ SOURCE]"

The new chip is expected around the latter part of this year with devices running on it to be out at either the tail end of 2015 or early 2016 assuming there are no delays.

As  rumoured earlier , Xiaomi is going for an even affordable smart phone by introducing the Redmi 2A. Essentially this is the same device as the current  Redmi 2  but it carries an even lower price tag of 599 CNY (about RM357).  If ordered on 8th April (one day only), the Redmi 2A is offered at an even lower 499 CNY price tag which is about RM297. That’s quite a lot of savings considering the standard Redmi 2 is priced at 699 CNY which is currently sold at RM449 in Malaysia.  So what’s the difference between this and the current Redmi 2? While it looks the same externally, the Redmi 2A runs on a Leadcore L1860C processor with 4+1-core clocked at 1.5GHz. There’s no performance figures yet but it probably would be a notch below the Quad-Core 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410 processor that’s powering the standard Redmi 2. It is also mated to 1GB of RAM and 8GB of on-board storage. It also gets 8MP 5-elements lens main camera and a front facing 2MP camera. Keeping the lights on is a 2,200mAh capacity battery. Connectivity wise it is similar with dual-SIM slots with the support for 4G LTE. Before you get excited, do note that the Redmi 2A only supports China’s 4G TD-LTE and 3G in TD-SCDMA bands.

If you’re like me and the flexibility of a Microsoft Surface is something that you look for in a computer but don’t really want to fork out a big wad of cash for a computer, then you might want to take a look at this. Microsoft has just announced the Surface 3, a cheaper alternative to the Surface Pro 3. Designed around a specific price point and targeted at students, schools and anyone looking for an affordable, ultra-portable computer, you can’t expect industrial strength performance from the Surface 3 but you can expect it to get your basic computing needs sorted. With a starting price of RM1,879, the Surface 3 packs a quad-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom x7-Z8700 processor with a choice of 2GB of RAM in the 64GB version and 4GB of RAM in the 128GB version. The screen is smaller, 10.8-inch multi-touch display with full HD resolution versus the 12-inch, 2160×1440 display on the Surface Pro 3. And you only get a 3-position kickstand instead of the micro-adjustable kickstand on the Surface Pro 3. But aside from that, everything about the Surface 3 is essentially the same as the Surface Pro 3. You get the tough as nails magnesium casing, stereo speakers with Dolby sound and support for the very intuitive to use Surface Pen, and you also get a microSD card slot to expand usable memory. If you Skype a lot, there’s a 3.5MP 1080p from camera and if taking pictures with a tablet is your thing, there’s also a 8MP 1080p rear camera (the Surface Pro 3 get 5MP 1080p for both the front and rear cameras. The Surface 3 runs full Windows 8.1 and can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free. You also get a one-year subscription of Microsoft Office 365 Personal, including Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, plus OneDrive cloud storage right out of the box. What you don’t get out of the box is the Surface 3 Type Cover keyboard and the Surface Pen. While I can forgo the Surface Pen (in fact, I lost mine already), you can’t fully appreciate what the Surface can do without a keyboard, and if you’re on a budget buying the Type Cover to go with your Surface 3 is a costly option (the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover cost RM499 retail). The Surface 3 goes on sale starting May 5, 2015. Pre-order starts on April 13. The 64GB version retails for RM1,879 and the 128GB version sells from RM2,249"
Amin Ashaari,Xiaomi introduces a special Mi Note just for the ladies,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/31/xiaomi-introduces-a-special-mi-note-just-for-the-ladies/,"Mi Note,Mi Note Malaysia,Mi Note price,Mi Note price Malaysia,pink Mi Note,Xiaomi,Xiaomi Malaysia","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Xiaomi",2015-03-31,"In conjunction with its 5th anniversary,  Xiaomi  brings a new variant for the Mi Note. But before you get all excited, the new  Mi Note  is not getting a new processor or more memory, instead it is specially designed for the ladies. It will be shod in a wonderfully feminine shade of pink. Despite being virtually unchanged, since it was  launched  in January this year, the Mi Note is no slouch. The 5.7-inch full HD (1920×1080) developed by Sharp/JDI boasts a contrast ratio of 1400:1, it’s protected with 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3 and features a 3.0 thin bezel. The device is a workhorse with a 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 processor mated 3GB of RAM that’s sure to keep up with the most demanding of tasks and multitasking processes. You get an option of 16GB or 64GB of storage and a dual 4G SIM card slot — one slot housing a micro SIM while the other, a nano SIM. In terms of battery, the Mi Note packs a 3,000mAh unit developed by Sony and LG.  In the camera department, you get a 13MP main camera complete with a 6-element f/2.0 lens and an optical image stabiliser — a rarity for devices under the RM1,800 mark, a price point where the Mi Note is expected to be positioned at when it officially comes to Malaysia in Q2 2015. There’s also a Phillips-sourced dual-tone flash and a 4MP front camera with a 2 micron/pixel sensor that Xiaomi claims is larger than the average pixel size in a smartphone. The larger pixel size helps capture more light and in theory, should produce better pictures under low light conditions with less noise. In terms of hardware, the Mi Note is hard to beat especially at its relatively low price point but its not without its flaws, the device is missing a micro Sd card slot, and that is a major turn-off for a lot of people. The Mi Note is expected to retail for about RM1,300 for the 16GB version and around RM1,600 for the 32GB version. Xiaomi says the Mi Note will be available in Q2 2015 but have not confirmed what colours will be available. For more on the Mi Note, check out our launch coverage,  here ."

Priced cheaper than expected,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/04/01/honor-4x-pre-order-starts-today-priced-cheaper-than-expected/,"Honor 4X,Honor 4X malaysia,Honor 4X price Malaysia,huawei,Huawei Honor 4X,Huawei Honor 4X Malaysia,Huawei Honor 4X Malaysia price","Android,huawei,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-04-01,"When it comes to cheap and good phones, people usually think of Xiaomi but many don’t realise that Huawei’s Honor brand of phones offer very, very good value for money as well. The  Honor 6  is a personal favourite of mine and the soon to be available  Honor 4X  is shaping up to be one hell of a bargain too. Pre-order for the Honor 4X starts  today  and if you’re in the market for a cheap and good phone, you might not want to miss out on this and here’s why, for just RM619 PLUS GST, you get a 5.5-inch (720p IPS panel) device that packs an octa-core 1.2GHz Kirin 620 processor developed in-house by Huawei with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of on board storage that can be expanded with microSD. The Kirin 920 processor used in the Honor 6 chugs along smoothly even in the most demanding situations exhibiting almost no lag at all. Of course the 3GB RAM in the Honor 6 aided performance significantly but expect the Honor 4X to deliver an almost similar level of performance as well. I would, however like to have more on board memory. The 8GB available in the Honor 4X will be just enough for the OS and not much else. The Honor 4X gets the same 13MP f/2.0 BSI rear camera developed by Sony which is the same as the Honor 6, and if the Honor 6 is any indication, you can expect the camera in the Honor 4X to be really good. For the selfie junkie, you a 5MP front camera. You also get dual-SIM support and 4G LTE. Probably the most impressive highlight of the Honor 4X is its battery life. Huawei claims the Honor 4X boast a 72-hour battery life, from its build-in 3,000 mAh battery. To put that into perspective, the longest lasting phone we’ve ever tested is the Sony Xperia Z3 which lasted up to 2 days on a single charge. Huawei claims the Honor 4X lasts a day more than the Z3! We haven’t tested this claim yet and can’t vouch got the claim but, that is a very bold claim coming from Huawei and if its true, it will be very useful for a lot of users out there. Out of the box, the Honor 4X runs on Android 4.4 with Huawei’s nice to look at but sometimes not so nice to use, EMUI 3.0 skin. In terms of design, the Honor 4X looks like a smaller version of the Huawei Ascend Mate 7 which is pleasing albeit generic. Once again the Honor 4X is available for pre-order starting from 3.08PM today at  vmall.my  for a very reasonable price of just RM619. This makes it cheaper that its closest rival, the Xiaomi  Redmi Note 4G . Orders will ship out starting from April 18."

With  Celcom ,  Digi  and  Maxis  starting pre-orders today, we’ve compared the plan offerings so that it is easier for you to decide.  The Galaxy S6 retails at RM2,599 (RM2,452 without GST) and its premium S6 edge goes for RM3,099 (RM2,924 without GST). Obviously that’s a lot to pay for a smart phone so getting it from a telco could be a more worthwhile option with the extra subsidies. No doubt you probably might to fork out almost the similar amount inclusive of the advance payments during sign up, but you’ll get more savings in the long run, provided that the plan actually fulfill your needs. All 3 telcos are offering the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge only in 24 months contract duration. In terms of plan offering, Maxis is only offering a single  MaxisOne plan  option which comes with unlimited calls and SMS to all numbers. For the Galaxy S6 edge, you would need to get the plan with an extra 1GB data which costs a total of RM158/month. Meanwhile, Digi offers the most number of plans ranging from RM78 to RM148 per month. These are the  newly revamped smart plans  where you can pick to have more calls or data in your monthly usage. For Celcom, the latest flagships are bundled with its  First Postpaid plans  that comes with a rather clever OPTIMISER feature. Unlike Digi’s plan where you need to decide for more internet or SMS, Celcom’s OPTIMISER actually self adjusts according to your usage in the month.  For consistency, all numbers above are listed before the 6% GST but we’ve included a total cost of ownership for 24 months with 6% for better reference. Take note that this comparison is based on plan offering and bundled price only. The minimal cost is based on the assumption that you won’t be exceeding its monthly allocation and it would definitely cost more if you exceed or use additional services from the telco. As always, sound off in the comments if you spot any errors on the table above. Both Maxis and Digi offers online orders while Celcom would require you to do so at their selected outlets. Most of the telcos are throwing in a free wireless charger for early pre-orders which stocks last. To secure your unit, you can visit the following links:

Here are 5 reasons why,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/30/samsung-galaxy-s6-camera-comparison-galaxy-s5-galaxy-note-4/,,,2015-03-30,"The  Samsung Galaxy S6  and the  Galaxy S6 edge  boast improved cameras for both front and back. The current  GALAXY Note 4  was proven to be  a stellar performer  with a 16MP main camera. Now on the latest flagship, it gets a similar main camera but Samsung has tweaked it further for better pictures at any time. For those who love to take selfies, the front now gets a better 5MP camera that should capture more detail than the front 3.7MP unit on the GALAXY Note 4. So how does the Galaxy S6 compare against the GALAXY Note 4 and its former  GALAXY S5  flagship? Read on to find out. Taking pictures with very little light is challenging especially when flash isn’t allowed. With a faster f/1.9 aperture, the Galaxy S6 is much improved over its predecessor producing less noisy images while maintaining as much details as possible. The pictures below were taken in a simulated low light box. Original :  GALAXY S5 ,  GALAXY Note 4 ,  Galaxy S6 Taking sharp pictures would require a pair of steady hands. With Smart Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), the Galaxy S6 is able to reduce the amount of shakiness that often leads to blurry pictures. Tested on a moving platform with a smart phone mount, you’ll notice a much steadier shot with the OIS enabled GALAXY Note 4 and Galaxy S6. Original :  GALAXY S5 ,  GALAXY Note 4 ,  Galaxy S6 The GALAXY Note 4 was the first Samsung smart phone with a rather cool 120 degrees Wide Selfie mode. Now you can capture a larger group without the need of a troublesome selfie stick. With a higher resolution 5MP front camera and a faster f/1.9 aperture, the Galaxy S6 takes better selfies than before. Original :  GALAXY S5 ,  GALAXY Note 4 ,  Galaxy S6 When taking a shot, the Galaxy S6 is much snappier and you can launch the camera app at any moment by double pressing on the home button. With its Auto Real Time HDR, you no longer need to switch on HDR when required. Looking at the same indoor shots below, you’ll notice less shadows at the ceiling without over-brightening the entire image for the Galaxy S6. Original :  GALAXY S5   2 ,  GALAXY Note 4   2 ,  Galaxy S6   2 For photography enthusiasts, you’ll be happy to know that the Galaxy S6 offers an array of controls for better fine tuning. For more controls, the camera interface has a Pro mode which allows manual adjustments for White Balance, Exposure and even manual focusing. Also new is a tracking auto focus which keeps your subject in focus for a blur-free capture. The Galaxy S6 may have the same 16MP pixel count as its current GALAXY S5 and GALAXY Note 4 but it is clear that Samsung has packed more features and tweaks to make photography more hassle free. The Galaxy S6 will be  launched in Malaysia  on 2nd April so stay tuned for the latest details coming soon."

Unfortunately that also means you would need to  fork out more  for their latest models which will be launched  this week  in Malaysia.  According to a source that tipped  Lowyat.net , the Galaxy S6 will be priced at RM2,599 in Malaysia, while its double-curve display Galaxy S6 edge would carry an even higher price tag of RM3,099. This more or less matches its pricing in other parts of the world where the Galaxy S6 edge  is priced higher   than the already premium iPhone 6 Plus. Well, this is more or less expected considering it offers 32GB storage as its base model (up from 16GB previously) and they have gotten rid of its plasticky build with the use of metal and glass. Furthermore with the introduction of GST, it does add up.  As comparison, the Galaxy S5 was launched at RM2,399 with 16GB of storage while the current Galaxy Note 4 is priced at RM2,499 during launch. Furthermore, its Galaxy Note Edge with a more functional curved display is priced slightly lower than the Galaxy S6 edge at RM2,999.  The biggest question mark is whether Samsung could hold better value for its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, especially when it is on a two flagships per year cycle. As comparison, Apple only releases their latest iPhones once a year and they seem to fare better in terms of resale value.  The last time Samsung sold a flagship phone at RM2,599 was 5 years ago, when it introduced the  original Galaxy S . That came with a low 4″ WVGA display and even the main camera doesn’t have a LED flash light. As for the Galaxy S6 edge, would you pay RM500 more for a double curve screen? Essential both S6 models are the same underneath apart from the display and a slightly bigger capacity battery.  [  SOURCE  ]"

While it is available initially at selected countries such as China, Australia, US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong, we probably might not need to wait too long for it to arrive officially in Malaysia. One of our readers have spotted the new Apple Watch being certified by SIRIM today which carries the number  A1553  and  A1554 . This is definitely a sign that it is coming soon to Malaysia. In case you’re wondering, the A1553 is likely to be the regular sized watch at 42mm and the A1554 is the smaller version for women at 38mm. The exterior dimensions  isn’t the only difference  here. The display on the 42mm version has a 1.5″ screen that does 390×312 pixels resolution (302ppi) while the 38mm unit has a 1.32″ display pushing 340×272 (290ppi) resolution.   Whichever size you pick,  the price are same for both and  the experience shouldn’t differ much unless your eyes can tell the pixel density difference of 12ppi. The Apple Watch Sports is priced at US$349 (RM1,295) for the base model with 38mm height and US$399 for the larger 42mm size. This is followed by the Apple Watch version starts from US$549 (RM2,038). For the ultra-rich, the premium Apple Watch Edition is priced starting from US$10,000 (over RM37,000) and it can go higher with more bling.

The shell looks quite identical to what is on the iPhone 5 or 5S but there are two subtle differences. The camera flash for one looks cut out on the supposed iPhone 6C back cover and has an oval shape while the cam LED on the iPhone 5c is round. Secondly the iPhone 6C back cover has two sets of speaker holes drilled into the bottom whereas the iPhone 5C only has a single set of four holes in the same area. This is starting to look like an iPhone 5S in a plastic body, which is similar to the iPhone 5C that is essentially an iPhone 5 underneath.

Amin Ashaari,Galaxy S6 and S6 edge official Singapore pricing gives best indication of how much the devices will cost in Malaysia,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/31/galaxy-s6-and-s6-edge-official-singapore-pricing-gives-best-indication-of-how-much-the-devices-will-cost-in-malaysia/,"Android,Pricing,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Malaysian Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge price,Samsung Galaxy S6 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 Malaysia Price,Samsung Galaxy S6 price,samsung malaysia,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-03-31,"The  Galaxy S6  and  S6 Edge  represents a new direction for Samsung. In direct response to customer complaints, the brand created its new flagship smartphone on a clean slate with a strong emphasis on premium build, quality materials and a timeless design. While the S6 and S6 Edge are the best build and most beautifully designed phones Samsung has ever created, the biggest question in everyone’s mind right now is, does all this goodness come with a hefty price tag. Early information obtained from  reliable sources  within the industry seem to indicate that and now that Samsung  has released  the official pricing of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge for Singapore, you might want to sit down before you ask, how much is the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. So are you ready for it?  The 32GB variant of the Galaxy S6, in Singapore, carries a recommended retail price of SG$998, while the more exotic dual-curved screen Galaxy S6 Edge, in 32GB guise, retails for SG$1,168. Before we proceed with the conversion, take note the electronic gadgets are generally cheaper in Singapore, around 10 – 15% cheaper, which means, you might be paying a bit more, when buying the devices in Malaysia. After conversion, the 32GB Galaxy S6 is RM2,693 and the 32GB Galaxy S6 Edge is a whopping RM3,152! Samsung got almost everything right with the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. The build quality, the quality of the materials, the design details and the feel of the device is the best that Samsung has ever produced but it now also looks to be two of the most expensive devices that Samsung has produced. The S6 duo look exquisite and are just delightful to hold in my hand but I’m not sure if people are ready to pay over RM3,000 for it, especially when we are in a time where people are more cost conscious than ever and there are genuinely viable, cheaper alternatives to the S6 and S6 Edge. Granted, these cheaper flagship phones from China may not be able to be the S6 and S6 Edge when it comes to delivering the whole package, for a price conscious market, these Chinese brands may make more sense — I’m not saying they are better but they do offer great value for money. I’ll admit, I like the S6 and I am lusting over the S6 Edge. Yes, everything in the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge is  cutting edge . You get the  best display , the  best processor , the best memory, the best camera — it’s almost the best phone you can get but I am finding it very, very, very…hard to justify paying an equivalent to a fresh grad’s salary for a phone.

Sirap Bandung,The Samsung Galaxy S6’s battery lags behind its predecessor,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/27/the-samsung-galaxy-s6s-battery-lags-behind-its-predecessor/,"Android,Battery Life,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 battery life,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,samsung galaxy s6 edge battery life,samsung s6","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-03-27,"At a extremely skinny 6.8mm thin, the  Samsung Galaxy S6  is one of the thinnest devices on the market. Unfortunately, such a slim figure comes with a price; there isn’t space to fit everything and the component that usually needs the most space is the battery.  The smartphone sports a 2,550 mAh battery, which is a fair bit smaller than the  Samsung Galaxy S5 ‘s battery of 2800mAh, but has to keep a 1440 x 2560 Quad HD super AMOLED display going for as long as it can.  According to PhoneArena’s  custom battery life test  that imitates a typical person’s daily usage, the Galaxy S6 manages to run for 7 hours and 14 minutes, which falls short by 24 minutes compared to it’s predecessor. The Samsung Galaxy S5 on the other hand lasted for 7 hours and 38 minutes, and that’s with a bigger battery and it runs on a lower Full HD resolution display. Juicing up the Galaxy S6 from 0 to 100 takes just 78 minutes, which is the fastest in the comparison.  Interestingly, the  Galaxy S6 edge  managed to pull more than half an hour extra of usage time despite only having a (2,600mAh) battery capacity 50mAh larger than the Galaxy S6. Bear in mind that the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge have better processors, RAM and a much higher resolution than the Galaxy S5; which sounds like a recipe for disaster but Samsung reckons it would last just as long as the Galaxy S5. This is probably due to Samsung’s power efficiency thanks to the smaller 14nm processor process and a energy saving but  blazing fast UFS 2.0 storage Another advantage of the Galaxy S6 is the support for fast charging that does 0-50% in 30 minutes. Also a welcome feature is native wireless charging support where you can juice up without pesky wires. At any rate the Samsung Galaxy S6 is still ahead of the pack compared to it’s competitors the HTC One M9, LG G3 and both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.  [ SOURCE ]"
Sirap Bandung,Are premium headphones that much better than cheaper alternatives? We test a couple of Shure’s entry level cans to find out,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/29/are-premium-headphones-that-much-better-than-cheaper-alternatives-we-test-a-couple-of-shures-entry-level-cans-to-find-out/,"Shure,Shure Malaysia,Shure SRH 144,Shure SRH 144 Malaysia,Shure SRH 144 Malaysia review,Shure SRH 144 review,Shure SRH 145,Shure SRH 145 Malaysia,Shure SRH 145 Malaysia review,Shure SRH 145 review,SRH 144,SRH 145","Mobile Accessories,Others,Product review,Video",2015-03-29,"Shure SRH 144 shown here. The SRH 145 has a similar design but a different colour Shure is a brand more known for their impressive microphones and large scale audio setups, but not too many people are aware that they do make headsets for the consumer market as well. We managed to get our hands on not one but two of Shure’s entry level headsets, the Shure SRH 144 and SRH 145 to test out to find out what exactly makes them different from the rest. The two headsets may look the same, but under the hood there are some fine differences in terms of their hardware and price. The SRH 144 has a sensitivity of 96dB and a frequency range of 30Hz-20kHz, while the SRH 145 features a sensitivity of 100dB with a frequency range of 25Hz-18 kHz. Both headsets have an impedance of 34 Ohms. 
It may not sound like much but you’ll hear the difference once you pop them on because the SRH 144 with its semi-opened design, is made for natural sound reproduction but the disadvantage here is that sound is going to leak out of the opened ear cups which means people next to you will be able to hear some of the music that you’re listening to, especially at higher volumes. The SRH 145, with its closed-back design, has more kick in the bass to it than the SRH 144 and isolates noise better but both will still allow ambient noise to mix with your music. This is something of a bother if you’re really particular about sound but is not really an issue for most people. In terms of price, the SRH 144 is retails for RM199 while the SRH 145 is quite a bit more expensive at RM299 which technically puts them in different price brackets though I don’t think the RM100 difference is necessary or even warranted given the two headsets are essentially the same. 
 The Shure 144 (right) and Shure 145 shown here, folded. Would be nice for Shure to pack a carrying bag as well Both headsets feature roughly the same looks and build with a hard plastic band that features a brushed metal styling in a darker shade for the SRH 144 and a lighter, shinier one for the SRH 145. The inner part of the band is lined with padded PVC leather which makes for a pretty comfortable wear in general.  The headphones are also built with portability in mind and are foldable to make it easier to store in transit, but long haired folks beware, you might find yourself a few strands of hair lighter as the hinges seem to trap hair very easily. Otherwise, the headsets easily fold to about half its size for storage. It’s a pity that Shure didn’t include a carrying case for the headsets.  As a whole, both headsets do feel quite solid and the design is kept quite simple yet classy, befitting Shure’s style. In short, they look and feel good.  
 Shure SRH 144 
 Shure SRH 145 The main difference between the two sets are mostly due to the shape of the cups, with the Shure SRH 145 being of a more enclosed shape for better noise isolation and a more open shape for the Shure SRH 144 which is designed more with comfort in mind. The cans on both models have a bit of swivel to it too. Of course, both of them have unique adjustable on-ear earcups in the sense that the cups can be slid up or down to get to your preferred level of adjustment; which is also better for the headset’s longevity as it does away with having to physically pull out the lower halves of the headset to get it to the right length.  Like many entry level headsets they feature a long 1.52m fixed cable which terminates in a nickel plated 3.5m stereo mini jack, which is still a bit of a surprise considering there are cheaper headsets out there have gold plated jacks. The cable isn’t anti-tangle either and doesn’t feature any controls of any kind so you are going to have to rely directly on your music device for that.  
 The semi-opened back design on the Shure SRH 144 allows for a more natural sound but it also means sound from the speakers can leak out Both headsets are of course, sporting some form of passive noise isolation in the form of the way their cans are made. In this case, the SRH 145 shines here as the enclosed cup design does isolate ambient noise more than the SRH 144, which only manages to cut down just a little bit of that outside noise. Regardless, it’s still not as good as active noise cancellation but every bit counts. In terms of sound, both headsets offer a slightly different audio experience.  The Shure SRH 144 has very crispy highs with solid treble and warm, smooth mids, alongside rather punchy bass that seems to get a little bit harsh at higher volumes, so this might be great news for those who enjoy bass heavy genres like electronica or metal. There’s a reasonable amount of sound leakage as well because of the cup design being more of a loose fit. 
The Shure SRH 145 on the other hand handles highs and mids about the same as it’s sibling but it has a richer and more powerful bass, but doesn’t suffer from the same harshness as the SRH 144 at higher volumes. So if you’re music experience is all about the bass, the SRH 145 offers is the better bet.  Both headsets do however handle vocals pretty well.  
 The Shure SRH 145 with its closed-back design offers better bass and passive noise isolation So are you getting what you’re paying for? Given the price point and the prestige of the brand they come from, we expected a bit better from Shure in terms of sound quality, but overall both models are not that bad.  They’re comfortable even with long term wear, has a decent degree of passive noise isolation (for on ear headsets) and they generally handle music quite well although the bass can be a little rough at higher volumes for the SRH 144. In terms of comfort I still prefer the SRH 144 more but if you do insist on cutting yourself off from the rest of the world, the SRH 145 might be the ticket for you. Shure is a recognised name when it comes to professional grade audio equipment. Anything that carries the Shure brand is coveted by professionals who want only the best, I guess that’s where the problem lies with the SRH 144 and SRH 145. I expected a lot from the two headsets because they carry the Shure name. In isolation, the two headsets are decent, they’ve gotten a number of things right and the sound quality is reasonable but when you factor in the price point and arguably better, cheaper alternatives that are available, it’s difficult to make a case for the Shure.

 The setup has three phones connected to a 5V 1A charger, 5V 2A charger and the last one works on a Quick Charge 2.0 enabled charger. As expected the Quick Charge enabled charger managed to charge the device to 50% in 40 minutes with the 1A model taking it to 22% and the 2A unit charging just to 32%. Of course, this is a test done by Qualcomm themselves and Oppo decided to one up them with this image on  Twitter .

It is reported that WhatsApp is working on a Cloud storage backup by allowing you to save your chat history and exchanged photos and videos on your Google Drive storage. This of course like any auto backup solutions would require your permission and you’ll need to grant Google Drive access to your WhatsApp application.  Usually if you’re switching from one Android to another, you would need to manually copy out the Database and Media folder into your new device. At least for iOS users, iCloud is doing a pretty good job of backing up and restoring your entire WhatsApp app completely with your past conversations. So far there’s no mention of its official roll out and hopefully it gets here soon before your next smart phone migration.

After seeing a couple of  leaked photos , the purported specs have been revealed covering from its 5″ mini to its 5.5″ models. The mainstream model would be the Nubia Z9 with a 5.2″ display that’s surrounded with a very narrow bezel. It pushes a full HD resolution of 1920×1080 and underneath it runs on the latest Snapdragon 810 processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. On-board you get 32GB of storage and for taking pictures, it carries a respectable 16MP + 8MP camera combo.  For those who crave for something bigger, the Nubia Z9 Max goes up a notch with a 5.5″ display which could possibly push either a Quad HD (2560×1440) or a standard Full HD (1920×1080) resolution. The processor and RAM are similar with its standard Z9 and it is expected to carry a smaller 16GB of storage. The cameras are similar too with a 16MP main + 8MP front selfie cam. Keeping the lights on would be a 2,900mAH capacity battery. Meanwhile the smallest and more economical unit of the lot is the Nubia Z9 mini. That settles for a lower 5″ HD 720p display and powering the device is an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. The rest of the specs are not too shabby either with the same 16GB on-board storage, 16MP + 8MP cameras and also a generous 2,900mAh battery as well.

If you need a phone to withstand the elements, the  Galaxy S6 active  with a more rugged exterior will be  introduced  later on. You can expect similar specs like processor, RAM and storage from its more elegant Galaxy S6 models on the Galaxy S6 active. For those craving for more expandable storage, the Galaxy S6 active is rumoured to come with a microSD slot. A source claims to have gotten this from a Samsung rep in Europe and there’s an on going  discussion  on reddit. He added that while the specs are similar to the standard Galaxy S6, it will get physical buttons at the front, which is similar to is current active variants of the  Galaxy S4  and  Galaxy S5 . This gives it a usable advantage over typical capacitive buttons but that also means it will lose out on having a fingerprint sensor. The camera apparently will be a notch below the current 16MP shooter on the Galaxy S6 but it would still come with Optical Image Stabilisation. Another likely omission would be its heart rate/UV sensor that’s usually mounted at the back next to its camera. But at least there would be a microSD slot, which is good news for those who want to fit in an extra 64GB or 128GB microSD to store more videos offline. With regards to the battery, the Galaxy S6 active is likely to be non-removable as well but if the  earlier rumours  are true, it may have a huge 3,500mAh unit which should last more than a day of use. The Galaxy S6 active is expected to be released in Mid-summer which is somewhere in July. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

It costs  RM359   RM429  RM399, which is quite reasonable but obviously it is a premium over its original China pricing of 399 CNY, which is roughly RM230. It is available only in White. In terms of specs, it uses Sony’s Exmor R 16MP Sensor which supports Full HD 1080p video recording up to 60 frames per second. Like the GoPro, you can control the camera remotely from your smart phone via WiFi. For storage, it supports microSD card up to 128GB and if you need to go underwater, it is possible with an optional waterproof case.  From initial comparisons, the Yi Camera seems to be quite impressive when  compared  with the more professional GoPro series.

In conjunction with its celebration, Xiaomi will be having a little surprise for its fans with a new product announcement in China.  While there’s no official teasers yet, it is speculated that Xiaomi could be releasing a new mid-range device that’s rumoured with the codename “Ferrari”. It was  spotted  in benchmarks for having a 4.9″ Full HD display and it runs on an Octa-Core Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM. Interestingly it is shown running on a newer Android 5.0.2. If this is real, this could be a more affordable alternative to the current Mi 4 and hopefully it does contain the necessary 4G LTE band to support international markets. Another possibility is their new entry-level Redmi device which was rumoured to be priced below RM300. According to early  speculation , it would share similar internals with the current Redmi 2 but it utilises a different processor to keep the price down.  If Xiaomi intends to make a big surprise, they could be announcing their very first  Mi Watch . It was reported that their upcoming smart watch will feature a round watch face with a metal frame. This would probably give the round smart watches like the Moto 360, LG G Watch R, Huawei Watch and LG Urbane some challenge, price wise.

Internally, it runs a Quad-Core 1.45GHz processor that’s mated to 1.5GB (instead of 2GB on the 49″ MiTV 2) RAM. Since it is a smart TV, it also runs as a media hub and gaming platform with Android 4.4 KitKat on board. For storage it gets a similar 8GB capacity but this time it lacks a microSD slot that was available with its 49″ variant. If you need to connect to external media, there’s a high speed USB 3.0 port as well as support for WiFi 802.11n. In terms of playback, it has support for H.265 10-bit hardware decoding along with H.264, MPEG4, REAL in RM, FLV, MOV, AVI, MKV,TS and MP4 formats. To navigate around, the bundled remote uses a simplified 11 button design but surprisingly they choose to opt for an infrared remote instead of the bluetooth version. The 40″ Mi TV2 is 14.5mm thick at the thinnest point and weighs 9.79kg.  For 1,400CNY more (RM822), you can actually get the standalone Mi TV2 (3,399CNY) without the sound bar + subwoofer accessory, which probably is more worth while if you’re looking for a brand new TV. You can compare the specs for both 40″ and 49″ models over  here . The biggest question of course is whether it will be made available outside of China. The reality is that the Mi TV is highly sought after in their local market and the biggest hurdle is having a local content partner overseas. Xiaomi isn’t just selling the TV as a standalone hardware and they are pushing it as a content box with a wide variety of videos and games at your disposal. Perhaps our local direct importers such as DirectD would soon find a way to bring a  couple units  in. For more info, check out Xiaomi’s  40″ Mi TV2  product page.  [  SOURCE   2  ]"

The  MaxisOne postpaid  offering now gets a cheaper MaxisONE Plan Start option for RM58/month. This sits right underneath its current MaxisOne Plan Lite of RM78/month and you’ll get unlimited calls and SMS to all Maxis/Hotlink numbers. The biggest difference with the RM78/month MaxisOne Plan Lite is the bundled mobile internet. For RM20 less, the MaxisOne Plan Start gets just 100MB of internet instead of 1GB. As part of its worry free proposition, there’s no extra charge once you’ve utilised your 100MB quota. As usual, your download speeds will be throttled until the next billing cycle or if you top up with additional quota.  You do get the option to top up RM30 for 1GB, RM58 for 3GB or RM116 for 6GB. For a one time heavy usage, there are booster packs that offer 200MB at RM10 and 500MB at RM20, which are costly in the long run. Calls and SMS to non-Maxis numbers are not included and you’ll be charged separately at RM0.15/minute for calls and RM0.10 per SMS. If you make lots of calls with at least 1GB of internet a month, you’re better off with its MaxisONE Plan Lite. This is probably more suitable to those who just need line for calling and texting without the need for data. For a full buffet of unlimited calls, the higher MaxisOne Plan of RM128/month offers unlimited calls to all numbers (within Malaysia, of course) with bundled 2GB of data.

After several rumours and leaks, the anticipated  HTC One M9 Plus  is finally going to be launched on 8th April in Beijing. Likely to be announced officially as the HTC One M9+, the upcoming device has been rumoured to carry a larger display of at least 5.2″ and it pushes a higher Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440. In terms of processor, the One M9+ could be released with two processor options – an Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 similar to its current One M9 or possibly a high-end 64-bit chip from MediaTek. Looking at the teaser, we can confirm that HTC would be bringing back its Duo Camera set up like the previous One M8. Build quality and design would be similar with its current One with a dual-tone unibody metal design as shown above.  For the past few weeks, leakster  @OnLeaks  has been supplying a  constant stream  of details on the upcoming One M9+ model. Some of the interesting claims include a fingerprint scanner at the front that’s housed in a Samsung-like home button. Now another  fresh leak  of a supposed working prototype seems to substantiate such claims as shown below. With the “More than One” event happening in China, this is likely to be an Asian exclusive model similar to the  HTC One E8  but eventually it might be released gradually to other markets. If the HTC One M9 isn’t  up to your expectation , would you be more excited with a bigger One M9+? So far the HTC One M9 has been released in Taiwan and the US market will be receiving theirs on 10th April. Until now, there’s still no news of its Malaysian availability and it could be released around May.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

If you’re looking for something more, the rumoured One M9 Plus is slowly becoming a reality as leakster @onleaks have shared a couple of more details of the new model. His new purported render reveals a slightly bigger device but not by a lot since it is rumoured to carry a slightly bigger 5.2″ screen. What’s interesting is the back where the main camera gets a larger camera module that’s accompanied by a secondary camera. Could this be a more photographic centric device with a hardware based selective focus feature? Over at the front, the One M9 Plus is alleged to have a fingerprint scanner that’s embedded on a home button. To be honest, the Samsung-like physical button seems out of place especially where it splits the bottom BoomSound speaker grill into half. @onleaks also added that the dimensions are reported to be 150.9mm x 72.5mm x 10.15mm, which is slightly bigger than the One M9’s 144.6mm x 69.7mm x 9.6mm dimensions. Probably the biggest thing to expect is the speculated Quad HD 5.2″ display, which would make this the first Quad HD smart phone from HTC. As always, take these new info with a pinch of salt as @onleaks claims that these are based on prototype units that he has seen so far.

Now, a new thermal image shows that the  HTC One M9 ‘s operating temperature has dropped from a extremely hot 55.4 degrees celcius down to a much more reasonable 41.7 celcius following the update, putting it around the same temperature range as it’s rivals. The smartphone’s metal body even looks like it’s doing good at dissipating heat as the image shows a rather even heat distribution though the whole device. However, it is possible that the above results were achieved by tweaking the thermal throttling configuration of the Snapdragon 810; in short limits are imposed on the processors maximum clock frequencies once the core temp hits a certain threshold. The new update puts said treshold at a lower point so as to keep the chip frosty albeit at the cost of reduced performance. It doesn’t look like the phone will be affected by overheating issues but performance being linked to temperature might be an issue now. How it will affect real-word benchmarks, we will find out eventually. [ VIA ] [ SOURCE ]"

You can even disable S Health, S Voice and even Calculator or Maps if you see fit, but some functions might be affected without crucial apps such as Google Maps. But if you truly want a more streamlined experience, you’ll finally get to kick all that bloatware to the curb.

After a long frustrating wait, OnePlus had  apologised  to its loyal fans and had reassured that they are still committed to the Malaysian market. Part of their solution is to appoint a local partner which would help to kick it off the ground. Now it appears that OnePlus has finally found one as Brightstar had just certified the 2014 flagship killer under SIRIM. With Brightstar as their official distributor, the OnePlus could be widely available on ground, unless of course they opt to have it sold exclusively online through selected channels. So far there’s no details on its pricing and model availability but looking at our exchange rate, we might see a price increase when it goes on sale. Just couple of days back, OnePlus had officially  announced a price increase  of 30-50 Euros for the Europe market.

Powering the whole thing will be a quad-core Leadcore LC1860 processor clocked at 1.6GHz instead of a Snapdragon 410 unit that’s running on the Redmi 2. The chipset however is probably what will be the driving factor in the final price, with companies resorting to using MediaTek chips as opposed to the more expensive Qualcomm ones. The mystery smartphone could cost as low as 399 CNY, which is less than RM 300.

Their current  Mi TV2  is a 49″ 4K resolution TV that comes with a Sound Bar and subwoofer for less than RM3,000 (3,999 CNY). After almost a year since its introduction, the Chinese brand is about to unveil its 3rd generation TV which will be announced tomorrow, on 24th March. This time Xiaomi and its partners have been tight-lipped as there’s hardly any info or leaks of their upcoming TV. On their official site, they are dropping teasers in a form of a user poll, asking if people prefer larger or smaller screens, 4K or 1080p resolutions and if they play more games or watch more videos. Could Xiaomi be working on a much larger Smart TV or are they releasing 2 sizes like  Micromax ?  Do expect integration into its Mi Home ecosystem where it would work alongside its Mi Router, Yi Camera, Mi Air Purifier and various internet connected appliances. Xiaomi has plans to bring its TV to the  international market  but it would require a content partner in each respective country. The Mi TV2 is currently among the hot selling products alongside its affordable Mi Purifier and if you’re lucky, you can probably snap a unit from grey importers such as  DirectD . It will be unveiled tomorrow and you can check out their teaser page  here ."

So far they’ve stated that it’s not a smart watch or a tablet, but a new product category for OnePlus. 
 In the three released teaser images we can see what looks like a sensor, the OnePlus logo drawn in red lights which could point towards some kind of motion tracking tech (perhaps like on the Nintendo Wii) and lastly a pair of grasping hands that are implying a controller of some kind. We will have to wait till April to get a clue about what OnePlus is really talking about, but if they suddenly pop up with a  gaming controller like what Xiaomi did  not too long back, we wouldn’t be entirely surprised.

As usual, it fixes a couple of bugs reported with its previous version and there are couple of performance tweaks as well. Since it is Beta, you would need to flash this  manually  on your Find 7/7a. If you are currently on its 2.0.6i BETA, the new version will be pushed Over the Air (OTA). Probably the biggest bummer is that it’s still running on Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Word has it that OPPO might bypass version 4.4.4 and jump straight to Lollipop, but there’s still no confirmation of its actual roll out date.  The Chinese brands have been coming out strong especially in 2014 but if they intend to capture more customers from a loyalty standpoint, they would need to be more committed to regular software updates. Most mainstream brands have already rolled out or in the process of updating its last year flagships to Android 5.0 Lollipop. This is something which the Chinese brands can overcome but only if they make it as a priority. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

And it’s not as if they have not done decision reversals in the past, as back in 2011 HTC stated that the HTC Desire wouldn’t be updated to Gingerbread 2.3 but ended up rolling out the update for the smartphone after user complaints. The HTC One M7 has been around for about only two years and the only change for it to get Android 5.1 officially would be the HTC One M7 Google Play Edition which is targeted for an April release. With 2 GB RAM, memory certainly isn’t an issue for the One M7, so hopefully HTC does reconsider getting out the update to Android 5.1 at the very least. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

According to HTC based on a survey, 69% of participants have claimed to have damaged their smart phone in the past 12 months and nearly half of them spent more than US$100 for repairs. So overall, this new Uh-oh proposition is something worthwhile having.  So the biggest question is when is the HTC One M9 coming to Malaysia? The global roll out of the flagship seems to be staggered and according to some sources, you might need to wait at least until May for it to arrive officially in Malaysia.

As Xiaomi supports openness with unlocked bootloaders on its devices, they welcome Microsoft to work with their fans to explore new experiences. For the selected Mi 4 power users, they would need to flash the software themselves, like how one would flash their own preferred custom ROMs. In case you’re wondering, the Windows 10 Technical Preview unfortunately is available only to China users. Xiaomi also reemphasise its commitment to Android and MIUI, so it looks like there won’t be an official Mi device with Windows 10 running out of the box. Once Windows 10 is officially released, you are probably able to make the switch by flashing the Mi 4 at your own risk.  [  SOURCE ,  Image Credit  ]"

Maxis has started teasing the device with the hashtag  #NextisNow . To confirm this further, both the Galaxy S6 (SM-G920F) and Galaxy S6 edge (SM-G925F) have also recently passed our local SIRIM certification. Like previous devices, you can expect Maxis to bundle the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge with its MaxisOne Plan. In terms of pricing, we would expect an upward trend from its previous launch prices. The Galaxy S6 with a minimum of 32GB storage is likely to cost more or about the same as its current Galaxy Note 4 that’s priced at RM2,499. Referring to some overseas pricing, the unique Galaxy S6 edge with a double curve edge display could  cost more  than the iPhone 6 Plus. To recap on the devices, the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge are essentially the same device underneath. Both gets a 5.1″ Quad HD Super AMOLED display that pushes 2560×1440 pixels resolution. Powering the new flagship is their very own Exynos 7420 (Cortex A-57 @2.1GHz + Cortex A-53 @ 1.5GHz) 64-bit Octa-Core processor that’s mated to 3GB of DDR4 RAM. The on-board storage uses a faster USF 2.0 solution which claims to be 30% faster than standard eMMC 5.0 storage. Overall, the new flagship not only looks good but it is quite a  stellar performer  as well. Unfortunately there’s no expandable memory and there’s a choice of 32GB, 64GB and 128GB storage capacities which is subject to respective markets. For taking pictures, it gets a 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabilisation along with a brighter f/1.9 lens. The front gets a higher resolution 5MP camera which also has a f/1.9 lens and Auto Realtime HDR mode. To capture epic moments quicker, you can bring up the camera app at anytime even while in sleep by simply double tapping on the home button. While everything looks tip top and upgraded from the last model, the Galaxy S6 unfortunately lacks water resistance that came with the Galaxy S5. It appears that Samsung is reserving all that weather proof feature for its “ Active ” variant that is expected to be announced later.  The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge also marks their first flagship device that comes without a removable battery in pursuit for a more premium unibody look. The Galaxy S6 gets a 2,550mAh capacity battery while the Galaxy S6 edge is slightly more at 2,600mAh. According to Samsung, the combination of its processor, storage and software tweaks have made the Galaxy S6 more efficient and it is rated to last just as long as the Galaxy S5. Fast Charging is present which can juice up from 0-50% in 30 minutes and for better convenience, the Galaxy S6 also supports wireless charging natively.

They’re so confident that they are willing to give away five units of its OnePlus One 64GB smart phones if they miss the release timeline. The reason given for the delay was due to unforeseen OS signing issues and stability issues on Lollipop as well as driver updates that were needed to be implemented, which took longer than the brand has expected. OnePlus is also planning to release their own Lollipop based ROM,  OxygenOS  which was built by their new in house developer team on March 27th.

Are they announcing a new  bigger device  or are they simply announcing HTC One M9 official availability along with a couple of goodies thrown in.  Apparently the Taiwanese brand would be introducing a new device  trade-in and damage replacement  service that would be called as “Uh-oh”. This appears to be better than the previous HTC Advantage as it even covers water damages for one year. Is that a big deal? We hope HTC has something else to show.

soyacincau,Digi’s new postpaid plans have gotten smarter for 2015,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/18/digi-new-smart-plan-2015/,"DG Smart Plan,DiGi,DiGi latest Smart Plan,digi new smart plan,DiGi Smart Plan,digi smart plan 2015,High Data,High Voice,Malaysia postpaid plan,Postpaid","DiGi,Players on the Field",2015-03-18,"Digi was the first telco in Malaysia to introduce an internet centric postpaid offering with its  Smart Plan  in 2010. You pay only for data, while calls and SMS are charged only when you need them. It was the ideal option for those wanting just the Internet and very little of everything else.  Then two years back, Digi got  a little creative  by bundling extra phone calls, SMS and that’s not all. They even split your internet quota for “Smart Apps” which is used specifically for social and instant messaging and the remaining for other uses such as web browsing, YouTube and tethering. That wasn’t too smart especially when the competition had caught on and offered more simplified data-only options such as  Maxis SurfMore  and  Celcom First Data plans . After its  recent rebranding , Digi has brought its smart plan back from the drawing board with a refreshed new offering. Now things are starting to look a lot “smarter” than before which could please the two different types of users.  
 For 2015, the new Smart Plans retain the same monthly commitments of RM50, RM78, RM108 and RM148. What’s changed is the bundled offering which you can choose between High Data and High Voice. Speaking of data, they have finally do away with the ridiculous quota split so you can now utilise your quota freely without restrictions. If you’re looking for an affordable plan, the lowest Smart Plan RM50 gives you either 2GB of data + 100 minute voice + 100 SMS or 250MB data + 400 minutes voice + 400 SMS.  As you commit for its higher plans like Smart Plan 78, 108 and 148, you get to enjoy additional value such as unlimited WhatsApp+WeChat instant messaging and  Free Music Freedom  subscription that lets you stream or download music without utilising your data quota. For its higher Smart Plan 108 and 148 plans, they are also throwing in free unlimited Facebook usage but take note it is applicable for specific High Data/High Voice options only. At the surface, it looks good that Digi is offering flexibility of its bundling to cater for voice or data centric users but it isn’t as dynamic as Celcom’s new  FIRST postpaid  plan that self-optimises according to usage. On the other hand, its Smart Plan 108 and 148 also gives you unlimited local voice calls and SMS if you opt for High Voice. This can be seen a direct competition to  MaxisOne Plan  and you get slightly more data quota as well. If you’re an existing Digi Smart Plan subscriber, this is something worth switching to especially when data is more important. For more information, visit Digi’s new  Smart Plan  page."

The supposed successor of the nubia Z7, the device is supposed to be announced March 26th and when any big release draws nearer more images tend to crop up. In this latest batch of images, we get to see the nubia Z9 sporting an rather incredible looking body to screen ratio with razor thin side bezels and what could be an aluminum unibody construction and possibly a fingerprint sensor. Assuming that this is indeed the phone, it looks just a hair thicker than Apple’s 6.9mm thin flagship iPhone. In terms of specs, nothing has been confirmed yet outside of the  leaked AnTuTu benchmark  but ZTE has stated that the nubia Z9 Max will have a 5.5″ inch screen and will have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 under the hood. Looking back at previous  Z7 models , the Z7 Max is a slightly downgraded version of the Z7 flagship and if ZTE’s latest batch of smartphones are following similar ideologies, the SoC of the Z9 Max pretty much means that the nubia Z9 is going to have a Snapdragon 810 too and likely Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box.

It was recently shown to the Russian media and there are 2 versions available – the Galaxy Tab A with a 8″ screen and a Galaxy Tab A Plus which comes with a full-sized 9.7″ screen. Unlike the previous Galaxy Tablets, the new Galaxy Tab A uses a more squarish 4:3 display aspect ratio instead of a widescreen 16:9 format that’s better suited for watching videos. Resolution wise, it is quite low rate with 1024×768 pixels, which makes the Galaxy Tab A Plus having a similar display as the  iPad 2  at 132ppi. Even a cheap RM599 device like the  Honor Tablet  could do 1280×800 resolution. Powering both models is likely to be a 64-bit Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 unit that’s mated to 2GB on the Galaxy Tab A Plus and 1.5GB on the smaller Galaxy Tab A. On-board there’s 16GB of storage which can also be expanded with microSD up to 128GB.   Both models pack 5MP main + 2MP front cameras and they also come in either 4G LTE and WiFi only options. Out of the box it is reported to be running on the latest Android Lollipop with a more lightweight TouchWiz experience. The 8″ version has a 4,200mAh capacity battery while the bigger version naturally gets more at 6,000mAh. Design wise, it does look similar to its current flagship  Galaxy Tab S  but the Galaxy Tab A series is thicker at 7.5mm.  Both tablets will be going on sale next month in Russia with the Galaxy Tab A going from 16,990 Rubles (about RM1,014) while the Galaxy Tab A Plus starts at 20,990 Rubles (about RM1,253). That’s quite a lot to pay for a screen resolution this low and they better be priced lower if it goes on sale in Malaysia.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA   2  ]"

The full release is happening towards later this year and if you have a Mi 4, you could probably flash it yourself. So will Xiaomi sell a Windows Phone device out of the box?

It also lets you take a peek at how your friends are doing too. You can log into the app via a guest account or via your Facebook, which is a bit odd because it doesn’t use HTC’s login or even a proper Google sign-in and neither does it allow you to be logged on using multiple devices at once.

With its value for money proposition, U Mobile wants to make the iPhone more accessible to all. One of the new features is new financing option called U Microcredit, that lets you purchase the phones on installment with a subsidised plan. Customers can now get the iPhone 6 starting from RM 98/month, as opposed to most plans from other telcos that require a hefty upfront payment and are essentially stuck to their plan for a set amount of time at minimum. For U Mobile postpaid or prepaid users who purchase the smartphone with a credit card, there’s no upfront payment and if you want to cut loose you simply have to pay the remaining monthly installment of the phone and that’s it, because the way their new plans work is that you’re paying for the phone but getting a subsidised plan. If you terminate earlier, you’ll lose out on the potential savings from the monthly rebates that come with the plan.  It is also worth pointing out that U Mobile claims to offer the first subsidised iPhone bundling in Malaysia. The same contract free and zero upfront payment benefits also applies as well. But unless you’re desperate, you’re gonna pay more for interest with MicroCredit. Assuming you get approved with the lowest 0.84% interest, it will cost RM98 for 30 months for the iPhone 6 16GB, which gives it a total cost of RM2940. That’s RM775 alone for interest. Also, there will be additional surcharges ranging from RM 60 to RM 90 depending on which MicroCredit plan you’ve chosen. We don’t recommend being committed so long just for a phone especially with this amount of interest. Also, starting from March 19th, customers who sign up before June 30th with the i60 plans and above will get unlimited high speed internet without data quota caps but it’s not forever. The promo period will end either 30th June or 30th September depending on your plan. Because of the change in pricing for the iPhone which occurred earlier this month, U Mobile plans have had a bit of a price revision as well, still costing a bit more than their old price plans due to the price increase and the coming GST costs, but the upfront payments still remain the same price. But take note, the old pricing for the iPhone still applies but only to what limited stock they still have. The new offerings will be available at all U Mobile stores starting 19th March 2015.

Now it appears its new Xperia Z4 smart phone could be released very soon as  @Onleaks  have shared a couple of high resolution press photos of the new device. Looking at the picture above,  HTC  isn’t the only one taking the “don’t fix it if it ain’t broke” route for its design. The Xperia Z4 looks very similar to the model it replaces. If you look hard enough, you’ll notice that the front camera has been repositioned, while the speakers are now more discreetly placed towards the edges like its previous Xperia Z2. It was also  speculated  with no surprise that the new Xperia Z4 won’t differ much from the current Xperia Z3 with a marginally thinner body (Z4: 7.2mm, Z3: 7.3mm) while roughly maintaining the same height and width.   Looking at the bottom, we get to see that the  micro USB port is now exposed  which means no annoying flappy covers to open when you need to charge. Sony has finally done away with waterproof flap covers with the recent  Xperia Z4 Tablet  and  Xperia M4 Aqua .  On the right side, the iconic power button along with its volume rocker and dedicated camera has been retained and there’s no flap cover on this side. For a cleaner look, Sony has moved the less accessed nano-SIM and micro-SD slots to the left side of the device. Surprisingly there’s no docking port which has been present in the previous Sony Xperia Z series. We can’t be sure but this could mean that the Xperia Z4 would probably be equipped with a wireless charging feature similar to the latest  Galaxy S6 . The Xperia Z4 was rumoured to be released sometime in June/July but with a press shot revealed fully like this, Sony could be pushing it earlier for Q2 launch. In terms of specs, expect the Xperia Z4 to run on the latest Snapdragon 810 processor and probably with a Quad HD display along with 4GB of RAM.  [  SOURCE   2   3 ,  VIA  ]"

The brand came up with it’s own UFS 2.0 storage which uses the same “Command Queue” tech as Solid State Drives that work by accelerating the speed of command execution resulting in about 2.7x faster performance than eMMC 5.0 memory that was part of the previous batch of Samsung’s flagships. And the Galaxy S6 has one under the hood. This brings us back to the lack of an SD card slot, which could have compromised the blazing fast performance, and this is true for all of 2014’s high end phones but it looks like Samsung really wanted their users to feel the speed though the lack of a storage expansion didn’t make users happy. GSMArena ran some tests with AndroBench (a popular storage benchmark that reads read and write performance) to determine who currently has the fastest storage in the market.  Samsung promised that the new UFC 2.0 storage was faster than the Galaxy S5 and tests shows that it was even better. The Galaxy S6 did 20681 IOPS (input-output operations per second) at random read compared to 4858 IOPS of the Galaxy S5 on the same test. That’s 3.25x times better. They also tested the microSD slot on the  Galaxy Note 4  and  Galaxy S5  using a Transcend Premium 300x microSDHC UHS-1 Class 10 16GB, which is pretty fast; to give an idea of the performance drop when apps are accessing a microSD card. The results put the Samsung Galaxy S6 on top of sequential and random read with a huge advantage over the competition as well as in random read operations but it’s on par with the Galaxy Note 4 on sequential write tests, and it’s lagging behind the  HTC One M9  and the Note 4 in sequential write however.   All tests were performed on Android 5.0 with the h/w encryption turned off, which is the default setting under Android Lollipop. The results show a massive improvement thanks to the UFC 2.0 storage over the previous gen of smartphones performance, which would have been made worse if a microSD read or write was part of the equation. It still cannot compare in terms of speed to say, an SSD but the sequential read speed of the Galaxy S6 is over half of Samsung’s own Samsung  850 Pro 256GB  SSD which has a read speed of 530 MB/s. Cheap microSD storage is still ideal for backup purposes but it looks like it’s days are numbered with high end smartphones, especially with cloud storage being a popular storage solution for backups. Plus you get 115GB free OneDrive storage with your Galaxy S6 anyway.

A recent GFXBench benchmark test of the  HTC One M9  found the device hitting a surface temperature of 55.4 celcius, which is ridiculously hot, and considering other tested phones ran a lot cooler it possibly something that wasn’t in the other smartphones tested; which could very well be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset powering the HTC One M9. Qualcomm  claims to be cooler  than the previous gen Snapdragon 801, but this confirms that it still has overheating issues that caused Samsung to drop the chip altogether in favour of it’s own much faster  Exynos chip  for the Galaxy S6. LG however said in January that the chip was one of the least overheating processors as it’s in the  LG G Flex 2  and the upcoming LG G4, but there are claims that the Snapdragon 810  throttles performance just to stay cool. While the HTC One M9 got hot enough to cook an egg on it, the other phones recorded much lower temperatures with the Apple iPhone 6 Plus hitting 39.4 celcius, with the HTC One M8 hitting 38.7 celcius, followed by the LG G3 which records a hotter 42.2 celcius and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 coming in the coolest at 37.8 celcius. This version of the HTC One M9 was tested using pre-release software so it’s possible that this could have muddled the results because the LG G Flex 2 is also powered by the Snapdragon 810 and hasn’t exhibited any overheating issues.

According to GizmoChina, the Mi 5 could be announced in Q4 of 2015, which is more than a year since the Mi 4 initially hit the market. There’s no official word on what features the Mi 5 will have under the hood but it’s speculated the smartphone would likely be around 5 inches because the Mi Note and Mi Note Pro have larger 5.7 inch screens and Xiaomi probably won’t want to launch another larger sized flagship smartphone this year. The image above was posted by Xiaomi CEO and co-founder Lei Jun that was showing various prototypes of Xiaomi smartphones including the Redmi Note, the Mi 2, Mi 3, and Mi 4. He also said that Xiaomi tends to make five or six protoypes for each phone before the final version is ready, so we might only get a proper peek once Q4 draws closer. [ VIA ] [SOURCE ]"

It will be available for purchase at HTC outlets in Taiwan starting next Monday, 16th March, followed by its local telcos on 23rd March onwards.  In terms of price, the HTC One M9 with 32GB on-board storage is going for 21,900 Taiwan Dollars which is about RM2,556. Another surprise is its bigger  64GB model , which is priced at 23,900 Taiwan Dollars, which is equivalent to RM2,790 if converted directly. The HTC One M9 will come with 3 colours and the gold colour unit is said to be available only in the following month.  To recap the specs, the HTC One M9 retains a similar 5.0″ Full HD Super LCD 3 display as its predecessor and it runs on a 64-bit Snapdragon 810 Octa-Core processor with 3GB of RAM. Like its predecessor, it gets a microSD slot supporting up to 128GB cards and its famed BoomSound front facing stereo speakers. For taking pictures, its main camera gets upsized to a 20MP shooter and its own Ultrapixel camera has been moved to the front for selfie duties. The battery has been upgraded slightly to a larger 2,840mAh capacity unit which is also non-removable. While the front appearance remains unchanged from the previous One M8, HTC has made some slight design revisions at the sides where it gets a dual-tone look.  So far no word on its Malaysian availability yet but we sure hope HTC would bring this in soon considering its rival Samsung would be pushing its new  Galaxy S6  flagship worldwide starting next month.

However such connections could put your data at risk especially while doing online banking.  To keep your internet traffic secured, Google appears to be taking a step forward with a Google VPN of its own. Someone has done a  little tinkering  with the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop on a Nexus 6, and has found a new “Google Connectivity Services” on it. At the moment, it doesn’t appear to work but it looks like this would run a VPN service (presumably free of charge) via Google each time you’re connected to an open WiFi connection. As it is still early, we are not sure if this will be final but the presence of such service does come as a surprise. Without an official announcement, this is still a work in progress and Google might just scrap it quietly later. If it does happen, it would certainly give users a greater peace of mind while utilising Free WiFi hotspots. Another question mark is whether this would be exclusive to Nexus devices and if they would extend it to all Android devices running on the latest Lollipop version.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Both models pushes Ultra HD resolution of 4K (2160p) with the smaller 42″ LED TV priced at Rs. 39,990 (about RM2,353), while the bigger 49″ version is going for Rs. 49,990 (about RM2,942). As comparison, Xiaomi’s Mi TV2 is priced at 3,999 CNY, which is RM2,373 at today’s rates and it comes inclusive with a soundbar and sub-woofer.  Both Micromax TVs run on Android but the smaller 42″ TV runs on an older Android 4.2 Jelly Bean while its bigger model gets Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Google Play Store is included, so you can install any apps including games. Speaking of games, the wireless remote control also doubles up as a game controller as it has a built-in gravity sensor. In terms of hardware, surprisingly the 42″ TV gets better specs with a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, 2GB of RAM, dual-core GPU, 3X USB (2x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.0) and 3x HDMI ports. The bigger version is similar but it gets just 1GB oF RAM and only 2x HDMI ports but the GPU is listed as a Quad-Core unit for better gaming. On-board there’s about 2.5GB of storage but it can be expanded up to 32GB using microSD. Connectivity wise, it gets WiFi and a LAN port as well. It is now available on  Flipkart  and there’s no word if it will be sold outside of India anytime soon. A 4K LED TV for less than RM3,000 is definitely a steal. You can expect a complete sell out just like the hot selling Xiaomi Mi TV2.  [  SOURCE  ]"

The new  Galaxy S6  is another showcase for Samsung’s display technology and it’s more than just a curved screen with a higher resolution. DisplayMate have put the Galaxy S6 and  Galaxy S6 Edge  through a rigorous battery of testing to see if it can top last year’s  Galaxy S5  and the  Note 4 . The Galaxy S6 and S6 edge are 5.1 inch Quad HD (2560 x 1440) displays with a pixel density of 577 ppi, with the only technical difference between the two being the flexible plastic materials used to make the S6 Edge’s display bendy. In colour accuracy tests to check colour reproduction, tests found that the Galaxy S6’s basic screen provides the most accurate image colors of any smartphone or tablet. The measured Absolute Color Error for the Galaxy S6 is just 1.6 Just Noticeable Color Difference, tied with the Galaxy Note 4. Samsung’s latest flagship also measured a 20 percent improvement in display power efficiency over the Galaxy S5; consuming only 0.65 watts over 0.82 watts at 50 percent brightness as well as being more readable in high-ambient light situations at 170 which is the highest DisplayMate has ever measured from any mobile device. DisplayMate also notes that the Galaxy S6 not only has over four times the amount of pixels as the iPhone 6 but significantly higher Absolute Colour Accuracy, lower power consumption and better viewing angles too, with increased pixel density over the Galaxy S5. As a final word, both the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge have the same level of performance, which makes them both industry leading displays in the smartphone market.

While we can’t be sure if Malaysia will be having it on the same date, we now have some pricing details from several countries.  For the base Galaxy S6, you could expect a higher price than the  Galaxy S5  (Launch price: RM2,399) due to its higher on-board storage of 32GB. We reckon that it could be priced around the current  Galaxy Note 4  range of about RM2,499-RM2,600. If you’re eyeing for the dual curved display Galaxy S6 edge, be prepared to pay more than the iPhone 6 Plus.  In  most countries  in Europe such as Austria, Finland, Spain and Slovakia, the Galaxy S6 is priced from 699 Euros while its more premium Galaxy S6 edge is priced at 849 Euros. When converted directly, that costs RM2,700 and RM3,282 respectively.  Obviously the prices of phones are different in most markets due to varying shipping cost and taxes. To give it more context that’s closer to home, we can compare the iPhone selling price which is priced at 699 Euros for the 16GB iPhone 6 and 799 Euros for the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus in those markets. Even after the  iPhone price increase  for Malaysia, several European countries are still retaining the same iPhone pricing since its launch late last year.  So going back to the Galaxy S6 edge price of 849 Euros. That’s 50 Euros (About RM200) more than the iPhone 6 Plus 16GB that’s currently priced at RM2,949 (formerly RM2,749). Furthermore, the iPhone 6 Plus is a much larger device with a 5.5″ screen, which could be a deal breaker for some since the Galaxy S6 edge is having a smaller 5.1″ screen size. Essentially both the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge are identical underneath and the only difference is the curved screen and perhaps a slightly larger capacity battery (50mAh). Would you go for the Galaxy S6 edge if it costs RM500 more than the standard S6? Let us know in the comments below.

The previous model, the Galaxy S5 came with IP67 rated dust and water resistance but Samsung has decided to do away with it on the latest model for a more premium look and feel. If you need a phone that you can take to the swimming pool, Samsung will be introducing its waterproof Galaxy S6 Active version very soon. Word has it that the rugged smart phone (SM-G890A) will make its debut soon on US operator AT&T. Spec-wise, it retains the same hardware under the hood, with a 5.1″ Quad HD display and a 14nm Exynos 7420 Octa-core processor that’s mated to 3GB of RAM. Its on-board storage is 32GB in capacity and it also gets a similar 16MP + 5MP cameras as its non-water resistant sibling. Probably the biggest advantage would be its battery, which claims to be a larger 3,500mAh capacity unit. That’s almost 1,000mAh more than the normal Galaxy S6 (2,550mAh) and Galaxy S6 edge (2,600mAh). With its frugal processor and power efficient Universal Flash Storage, the Galaxy S6 Active could possibly last up to 2 days on a single charge. Being an “active device”, the upcoming model would come with some rugged finishing to withstand the elements. As a result, it would be slightly thicker (8.8mm) than the 6.8mm side profile of its Galaxy S6. For a more practical experience, we hope Samsung would go with a flapless design for its microUSB port just like the  HTC Butterfly 2  and recently announced  Xperia M4 Aqua . [  SOURCE  ]"

With its ongoing  registration of interest , U Mobile has revealed more details of its offering which are one of a kind in Malaysia. For starters, they would be offering the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus at previous lower prices, while stocks last.  While they have yet to reveal their plan details, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from U Mobile claims to come with True Unlimited High-Speed data. Apparently this isn’t the so called unlimited usage with free throttled speeds but an actual bottomless internet with no limit for high-speed access. This we think is likely applicable with their new highest commitment plan. For postpaid subscribers, U Mobile says there won’t be any lock-in contracts and you’re free to leave the network without excessive penalty charges. The reality is that this is likely the case if they convert their phone subsidy into monthly rebates where you can enjoy fully only if you stay with the throughout the period. For those who prefer the flexibility and control of prepaid, U Mobile too will be offering subsidised iPhones as well.  In addition, U Mobile would also offer an easy payment scheme from a micro credit facility.

The HTC One E9 seems to sport a flatter  Desire-Ey e style body, having ditched the curved back that’s featured on the M9. If the specs are accurate, the HTC One E9  will have a QHD 2660 x 1440 screen which could be a sign that a larger One M9 Plus or M9 Max could be released with a larger display, 2GHz MediaTek octa-core chip, 3GB RAM, 32GB memory with MicroSD support and a 20 megapixel rear snapper. The “standard version” could also possibly ship with a 13 megapixel front camera while a “higher end” version could carry a low light 4 MP UltraPixel camera like the One M9, which is interesting considering that the E-series is usually seen as the economy version of the HTC One M series smartphones. One of the previous E models, the  HTC One E8  had similar specs to the  One M8  but was significantly cheaper by RM 700, so it’s safe to assume that the One E9 would be significantly cheaper than the One M9 as well. Time will tell if the leaks are true. [ VIA ][ SOURCE ]"

This is their mid-range 64-bit smart phone that supports dual-SIM and 4G LTE. At the front, the 5.5″ screen pushes a modest HD 720p resolution and under the hood, it comes in two 64-bit processor variants – 1.2GHz Quad-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 and a 1.2GHz Octa-Core Hi-Silicon Kirin 620 version. Whichever model that comes, it gets a generous 2GB of RAM and 8GB of on-board storage which can be extended with microSD.  For imaging, it gets a similar 13MP Sony BSI main + 5MP selfie cams as the Honor 6. Keeping the lights on is a decent 3,000mAh capacity battery which claims to last up to 3 days. At time of writing, it still runs on Android 4.4 KitKat with its latest EMUI 3.0 on top. Overall, the Honor 4X is 8.65mm thick and it weighs 170g. With its imminent launch happening soon, Honor Malaysia has started its  registration of interest . Pricing wise, do expect it to be competitively priced like its Honor 6. In China, the Kirin version of the Honor 4X is  priced from 799 CNY , which is about RM469 when converted directly. This could possibly give the  Redmi 2  (RM449) a serious run for its money.

It’s upcoming Huawei P8, the replacement of its current Ascend P7 flagship is set to be launched sometime next month in April.  To build up the hype, they have started releasing teasers, with the first one focusing on battery life. The Ascend P6 and Ascend P7 were Huawei’s showcase of making a premium smart phone that’s also slim to hold. If they intend to give a longer battery life, the Chinese maker could either add a larger capacity battery or perhaps better optimisation to squeeze more hours from its Kirin processor. The image shows a digital figure of 8 with a battery bar taking of its of piece. We can’t be sure right now but they probably would be revealing 7 more new features in the next couple of weeks towards its launch. In terms of specs, the upcoming Huawei P8 (They are likely to drop the Ascend moniker) is speculated to carry a 5.2″ Full HD display and it would probably run on their newer Kirin 930 processor that’s currently powering their new MediaPad X2 tablet. It is also likely to carry a much generous 3GB of RAM and a twin-camera combo that was featured on the  Honor 6 Plus .  The new Kirin processors are getting more competent especially the Kirin 920 on the Honor 6 which is almost on par with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 801 processors.

One of their recent initiatives is to  cap its Pay As You Go  usage, eliminating excessive bill shocks for accidental usage. Instead of the usual insane rate of 10sen per 10KB (RM10 per MB), those without a data plan would be charged RM10 for each 50MB used and this will be limited to RM50/month for up to 250MB at full speeds. For those who own a smart phone without an internet plan, Maxis wants to get you started with their new basic internet add-on of only RM18/month. The basic Just4me plan offers 200MB of data and unlimited WhatsApp for 30 days at RM18/month. This offers more value if compared to the normal Pay As You Go Rates. Essentially this is a double-up offer from its  current 100MB/month plan  of RM18. The promo internet pass lasts 30 days from time of activation and upon finishing your quota, there’s no excess charge but download speeds will be slowed down. To activate, dial *100#, select “What’s New”, choose Just4me and confirm your subscription.  If you’re subscribing to this plan, do take note for a couple of things. With its Unlimited WhatsApp promise, do watch out if it uses your 200MB quota including sending or receiving photos/videos. Also after upon depleting your data quota, we are curious to know if Maxis offers full speed access for WhatsApp inclusive of downloading attachments. After all, WhatsApp is still usable even after being throttled but being able to receive attachments at full speeds would be a deal breaker.  Obviously if you’re a heavy usage user, you are better off with bigger internet data plans that offer better cost per GB. For those who don’t make much calls and SMS, we would still recommend their  SurfMore 50  which offers 2GB of data at RM50/month. For more info, head over to Maxis’s  Just4me  promo page."

iPhone 5S 32GB –  RM2,199  RM 2,349 Lucky for us, it appears that the iPad and the iPhone 5c are still retaining it’s original pricing. The reason for the markup might just be due to  fluctuating exchange rates  after our currency took a hit in recent months against the Dollar.  The iPhone was already carrying a premium price tag before the increase and there’s no signs of slowing down especially when it  hit record sales last quarter . Thanks borneoboi for the tip!"

Aimed mostly at audiophiles who demand to have the very best music quality while they’re out an about; the device has a very premium looking aluminium frame and a bunch of audio-centric features lurking under the hood. Among these are an S-Master HX digital amplifier as well as Sony’s DSEE HX tech that upscales your music to sound even better. The Walkman will also support FLAC, MP3, AAC, WMA, AIFF, WAS, ALAC and DSD files as well as audio at 192kHz/24 bit, very much in the same vein as it’s predecessor the NW-ZX1. If 128GB isn’t enough for you (if you listen to solely FLAC type files, it probably isn’t) , users can also add extra memory via the microSD slot, possibly while using their  premium microSD card  made just for the music minded. They’ve also further upgraded the signal path and power supply stages with high quality components for even less interference.

From a convergence Android tablet with an accompanying keyboard, the latest  Transformer Book Chi  aims to replace both your laptop and your tablet. Announced during CES 2015, the Transformer Book Chi series offers a Windows 8.1 experience while giving a flexibility of having an interchangeable notebook or tablet mode.  The smallest of the lot is the ASUS Transformer Book T90 Chi with an 8.9″ display and a compact keyboard that lacks a touchpad. This reminds us of the compact  Sony VAIO P-series  but ASUS lets you detach the screen fully for a tablet mode. The screen pushes a 1280×800 resolution on its 8.9″ IPS screen and it runs on an Intel Atom 1.46GHz Quad-Core Z3775 BayTrail-T processor that’s mated to 2GB of RAM. This is obviously better than the  EeeBook X205  which lacks a touch screen display. You get an option of 32GB or 64GB of on-board storage which can be expanded with microSD. On the tablet itself, it gets a 2MP camera in front and a main 5MP auto focus shooter at the rear. Overall it is 7.9mm thick and weighs 0.75kg inclusive of the keyboard dock. In the hands, it feels pretty solid with a nice matte finish and diamond cut finishing around the edges. If you’re looking for something bigger, the ASUS Transformer T100 Chi is a slightly bigger upgrade with a 10.1″ Full HD (1920×1200) display and the dockable keyboard now comes with a reasonably larger trackpad as well. The rest of the specs are similar to its smaller T90 Chi but it also gets a much larger 128GB on-board storage version. In terms of slimness, the T100 Chi is incredibly thin at only 7.2mm for the tablet only. Obviously with a bigger screen and keyboard, the T100 is heavier at over 1kg.  For the ultimate powerhouse, it is none other but its top of the range Transformer T300 Chi with a larger 12.5″ Quad HD (2560×1440) or Full HD (1920×1200) display. Under the hood it gets a more capable Intel Core M 5Y71 processor with up to 8GB of RAM. For on-board storage, you have the option of either 64GB or 128GB SSD. Unlike its more affordable Transformer Book T90/T100 Chi, the T300 runs on Windows 8.1 Pro edition instead. While it claims to be thinner than a MacBook Air, the T300 with its humongous “tablet” feels quite heavy compared to other similar screen size ultrabooks in the market. When detached, the T300 Chi “tablet” feels too weighted and wide to be considered as portable.  In terms of pricing, the T90 Chi starts from US$299 (about RM1,100), while the larger T100 Chi starts from $399 (about RM1,470). Meanwhile its larger T300 Chi starts from US$699 (about RM2,576) for its Full HD spec model. Availability wise, ASUS Malaysia will be introducing the Transformer Book Chi series locally at the end of this month. With up to 10 hours of battery life (up to 8 hours for T300), the Transformer Book Chi series is worth considering for most road warriors. If you need top notch processing performance, you probably need to look elsewhere with at least a Core i5 processor."

Over at the sides, it has a similar 3 button layout for volume control and power/wake button. So far there’s no view from the front but we reckon HTC would be using the same design as the current One M8/M9. It may be possible that HTC could fit a fingerprint scanner at the front that works with a single touch. In terms of specs, the One M9 Plus could be released in 2 versions –  MediaTek MT6795  or a Snapdragon 810 powered unit.

Apple’s iPad Air 2  was also given additional RAM at launch last year as opposed to the 1GB on the original iPad Air. The new iPhone 6s models will also be launched out of box with the Apple SIM card seen on the Wi-Fi + Cellular Apple iPad Air 2 that would allow users to select a number of short term plans from AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint in the U.S. and EE in the U.K, though how the Apple SIM configuration would function with Malaysian telcos is still anybody’s guess as the move is unlikely to sit well with telcos in general.

The new iPad is expected to be sporting newer hardware and performance oriented improvements like improved multi-tasking to name a few. The larger iPad is part of  Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s effort to bring some new life to the iPad line, which he feels sales is being affected by competition from larger iPhones which had delivered  record profit  last quarter. If Apple sticks to it’s established cycle of announcing new iPad hardware there is a chance the tablet could make an official appearance sometime in October or the weeks to follow, assuming Apple can nix the supply issue.

But the blue oval of tech still commands a large chunk of the smartphone market share (24.7% in 2014 over Apple’s 15.4%), according to Gartner.  However, Apple is not the only problem Samsung has in his hands. On the other end of the spectrum, you have Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo and Oppo, these Chinese brands are quickly winning customers over in the middle and lower end of the market segment — a segment that used to be a Samsung stronghold. If the trend continues, Samsung will have a major problem in its hands. “Samsung’s performance in the smartphone market deteriorated further in the fourth quarter of 2014, when it lost nearly 10 percentage points in market share,” said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. “Samsung continues to struggle to control its falling smartphone share, which was at its highest in the third quarter of 2013. This downward trend shows that Samsung’s share of profitable premium smartphone users has come under significant pressure.” This makes the  Galaxy S6  and  S6 Edge  the most important devices Samsung has ever produced. Announced at Mobile World Congress 2015, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will have to turn Samsung’s fortunes around and putting the brand back on top over arch rivals, Apple.  
 Click for larger image Meanwhile, the smartphone pie continues to grow. Worldwide smartphone sales continue to grow at record pace. Last year, smartphones sales totaled a whopping 1.2 billion units, up 28.4% from 2013 and smartphone sales represented two-thirds of global mobile phone sales. Apple reported its best quarter ever in the fourth quarter of 2014, which saw it sell 74.8 million units and move to the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus continued to see huge demand with sales in China and U.S., growing at 56% and 88%, respectively. In the best of the rest category,  Lenovo  with its acquisition of Motorola complete, rose to the No. 3 spot in the global smartphone market, commanding a 6.6% global market share and growing a massive 47.6% growth year over year. Driving Lenovo’s strong growth is China, Russia, India, Indonesia and Brazil. Chinese vendors, such as  Huawei  and  Xiaomi , are continuing to improve their sales in China and other overseas markets, increasing their share in the mid to low-end smartphone market. “Chinese vendors are no longer followers,” said Ms. Cozza. “They are producing higher quality devices with appealing new hardware features that can rival the more established players in the mobile phone market. Brand building and marketing will be key activities in deciding which Chinese vendors can secure a foothold in mature markets.”

soyacincau,Add a fingerprint scanner to your smart phone with this little device,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/05/add-a-nurugo-fingerprint-scanner-to-any-smart-phone-with-this-little-add-on/,"Android,Biometric,fingerprint,fingerprint scanner,MWC 2015,Nurugo,Nurugo One Touch,security",Mobile Devices,2015-03-05,"Your fingerprint is probably one of the best way of securing your device, offering better than average protection that can be unlocked with a single touch. However such feature is only limited to high-end flagship devices that normally cost more than RM2,000. If you want to add fingerprint security to your existing entry to mid-range device, here’s an interesting solution that was spotted at  MWC 2015 . It is a fingerprint scanning module that you can attach to your smart phone’s camera lens.  Roughly the size of a small USB thumbdrive, the Nurugo Fingerprint scanning module uses your phone’s camera for optical recognition. To keep it in place, they have a magnetic sticker which allows you to attach the module seamlessly. Since it requires a flash light, this probably means that their current module would be compatible with devices having its LED placement below the camera lens, like  Mi 4 ,  Redmi  and  Galaxy S4  as shown at their booth. In terms of functionality, the Nurugo solution is unlocked with a single touch instead of the traditional swiping motion on standard capacitive scanners. However it is limited to 45 degrees angle instead of a full 360 degrees. Depending on which feels more comfortable, you can register your fingerprint at the angle of your choice. Since the Nurugo solution is optical based, it would still work even with wet or dirty fingers. The only gripe is probably the thickness it adds to your phone and also the trouble of taking it off each time you need to take a picture.  At the moment,  Nurugo  is looking for partners to distribute its fingerprint security solution worldwide. Perhaps some enterprising Malaysian companies might bring this in if there’s enough interest."

Spotted on display at  MWC 2015 , the tablet borrows heavily from Apple’s designs; albeit sporting Android instead of iOS. Under the hood you’ll find am Intel 64-bit Atom processor, 2GB RAM, an 7.9 inch IPS display at 2048 x 1536 resolution as well as 32GB internal storage and a huge 5,300mAh battery in an aluminium unibody frame. It will also feature a 8 megapixel rear camera as well as a 5 megapixel front camera with 1080p recording. More after the break. Of course, all that hardware would come feeling very familiar to an iPad mini as it is, but has a slightly more simplified design while looking very sturdy and light. The N1 runs Android 5.0 Lollipop but with tweaks to accommodate Nokia’s “ Z launcher ” that’s basically an interface with two rather distinct features. For starters it has an adaptive four-by-three grid of apps on your home screen that’s populated based on the apps you use and when you use them. So if you’re one to hit Spotify in the morning while you get ready for work, it’ll push that app to grid for easy access.  There also isn’t a standard app drawer on the N1, but you’ll find all your other apps on the next page of the home launcher screen. The other feature of the Z launcher is the “scribble search’ feature that you can draw letters on the home screen to use to search for apps. Drawing a letter or a name will bring up a grid of options with apps and contacts, and though the muted colours and lack of customisation might be bane or boon depending on the user. Having the Z Launcher on the Nokia N1 is a fresh approach for an Android Tablet. While the launcher is easy and intelligent to use, the N1 feels competent but there’s a little sense of drag when browsing around. In the hands, the Nokia N1 feels quite solid and it looks very linear with smooth rounded edges, and a minimalist design. At the bottom, it resembles closely with an iPad mini and the centre mounted micro USB port is a type C version which allows you to plug your cable in any direction, just like Apple’s lightning connector. Speaking of colours, the Nokia N1 will only be getting a rather bare looking Natural Aluminium and Lava Grey options. The N1 was a surprised device from Nokia, considering they had “exited” the hardware business when Microsoft Devices took over its smart phone division. According to a Nokia rep, they are experimenting a new way of doing devices which includes working with a partner such as Foxconn and with more involvement in terms of  design and software , rather than simply sticking a logo onto a ready made product. This is just their first step and they would be experimenting with more products in future. The tablet is currently only available in China but it will be retailing at around $249 (RM 902) which is pretty attractive pricing. If the similar sized  Xiaomi Mi Pad  at RM799 feels too and plasticky, the Nokia N1 is a worthy alternative if you’re looking for something more upmarket. We can only hope that it will make it’s way here soon."

With new premium smart watches being announced this week at  MWC 2015 , Pebble has thrown in a new surprise with a new steel variant. The Pebble Time Steel isn’t just the same device with a metal body. It gets a larger battery which can last up to 10 days, 3 days more than the standard Pebble. The frame is made from a well crafted CNC-finished 316L stainless steel and the front lens is toughen with Gorilla Glass. Compared to the original Pebble Time, the steel version is a mere 1mm thicker. Like the original  Pebble Steel , you’ll get both stainless steel and leather straps out of the box.  The Pebble Steel is offered with 3 colour choices – Gunmetal Black, Silver Stainless and a new Gold colour as pictured above. The Pebble Time Steel will retail for US$299 but it can be yours for US$250 if you pledge for it on  Kickstarter . If you’re among the first 50,000 people who have pledged for the original Pebble Time, you’re still able to upgrade to the steel version. For those who can’t decide which one to get, there’s a special duo combo option at US$400, where you can have both original and steel versions. In addition, Pebble has also announced its new smart straps which adds more functionality to the Pebble Time. Underneath the watch, the charging connector pins also double up as an extension port, where you can add modular straps to add more functions such as GPS, NFC, heart rate sensor, extended battery and more. Swapping these straps is easy as there’s a built-in release hinge, so that you can replace them without additional tools. That’s all they have revealed for now and there’s no further details of pricing and availability of its smart straps.

Released about a year ago, the One M8 comes with a 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 SoC under the hood. Apparently HTC is planning an updated version of the device that will sport a newer, albeit midrange Snapdragon 615 instead. The chip will be a 64-bit octa-core CPU with four Cortex-A53 cores clocking 1.7GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocking at 1 GHz. The news comes from HTC’s Benelux arm in Europe so it’s likely that the change will come in that market (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) but HTC might do this for other markets as well. We don’t know when the switch is going to occur and exact pricing but the new One M8 will definitely be cheaper than the  HTC One M9. [ SOURCE ]"

Executive vice president of Samsung’s product strategy team at  MWC Barcelona , Roh Tae-moon said that the Korean company was indeed considering the introduction of the curved display, with the original Note Edge not being the big hit Samsung was hoping it will be. There’s a considerable amount of time till the next major Unpacked event, so that’s plenty of time for the corporation to rethink their potential design for the Samsung Galaxy Note 5.

In terms of specifications, the HTC One M9 is thoroughly modern with a top of the top of the line Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of super fast DDR4 RAM and 32GB of on board storage, so you can expect to perform well in both the AnTuTu and Geekbench tests.  As you can see, the HTC One 9 is ahead of the competition posting a respectable 52530 in the AnTuTu test and a 1093 in the Geekbench single core test and 3455 in Geekbench’s multi core test. This puts the One M9 above all other flagship smartphones out there. It’s better than the current benchmark champion, the Meixu MX4 and its also better than the Galaxy Note 4 and the OnePlus One. However, as far as benchmark test results are concerned, the One M9 pales in comparison to the  Galaxy S6 . The Galaxy S6 posted a score of 67000 in AnTuTU and a score of 1476 in the single core Geekbench test and 5104 in the Geekbench multi core test. This is perhaps due in part to a new and improved Exynos 7420 octa-core processor that boasts a 14nm core (vs a 20nm core in the One M9) that’s mated to a 3GB DRR4 RAM and for the first time in a smartphone, the use of Universal Flash Storage developed by Samsung that claims to be 30% faster and 50% more energy efficient than eMMC memory — the most common form of memory embedded in high-end smartphones today, including the HTC One M9. Of course, benchmark scores are just one aspect of a device’s capabilities. Other aspects like battery life, ease of use as well as display, camera performance and data connectivity performance are all equally as important, and for that we’ll need more time with the HTC One M9.

Announced in  January this year , the Redmi 2 is Xiaomi’s newest entry-level smartphone. Powering the Redmi 2 is an updated 64-bit 1.2GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 410 processor with a claimed 50% improvement over the Redmi. The processor is mated to 1GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 8GB of on-board storage that can be expanded using microSD card. The main camera is still an 8MP f/2.2 shooter with 5-element lens from the previous Redmi while the front camera has been updated to a 2MP unit that is capable of shooting HD 720p videos. The battery has been upgraded to a slightly larger 2,200mAh unit developed by Samsung. The Redmi 2 supports QuickCharge rapid charging technology that speeds up charging by 40%. Despite the bigger capacity battery, the Redmi 2 is more compact, lighter and thinner than its predecessor (133 grams/9.4mm in the Redmi 2 vs 158 grams/9.9mm in the original Redmi). Out of the box, the REdmi 2 runs on Android 4.4 with Xiaomi’s newer MIUI 6. You also get a 4.7-inch 720p HD display 4G LTE support. There’s also an  enhanced version  of the Redmi 2 that brings with a 2GB of RAM and a 16GB of storage. We’re hoping Xiaomi will be bringing the enhanced version to Malaysia instead of the basic version that offers less RAM and on board memory. In terms of pricing, the enhanced version of the Redmi 2 retails for 799 CNY or about RM465 at the current exchange rate. If you can’t wait, the Redmi 2 is already available in Malaysia through various  grey importers ."

The new bigger 5.7 inch OLED screen has an improved resolution to a good 1920 x 1080 resolution with double the frame rate of the last unit at 120Hz. The field of view has been given a bump up as well, now at almost 100 degrees as well as lower latency at just under 18 miliseconds. They’ve also included nine LED sensors on the outside which makes it easier for movements to be captured by the corresponding PlayStation 4 camera and adds to the cool glowy-ness of the whole thing. When will we get it? Sony says that we will see a retail launch in the “first half of 2016″ which is not too far off, though they haven’t yet dropped off any hints about pricing or a proper name for the device so it will still be called Project Morpheus for now.

Putting a smartwatch on your wrist is like making a statement — I’m cutting edge and I’m stylish. That’s the reason why smartwatches have evolved from square displays made out of plastic to stylish timepieces crafted from polished steel and glass. And this is one of the most stylish smartwatches at Mobile World Congress 2015 – the LG Watch Urbane. The LG urban is stylish because it doesn’t look or feel like what a typical smartwatch. The round watch face, the polished metal body and a selection of quality straps made out of leather, metal and various other materials, means the LG Urbane is built to last with a timeless, classic look. The LG Urbane is stylish because it looks like a very well made mechanical watch. The centre piece of the Urbane is its bright and clear 1.3-inch plastic-OLED display (320×320/245ppi). It may not be as advanced as the 1.4-inch AMOLED display and on the Huawei Watch with its Sapphire glass high 400×400/286ppi resolution but the display on the Urbane is still very good to look at.  There are two versions of the available. The standard version, which runs on Android Wear and will require you to pair with a smartphone to work. And the LTE version with built-in LTE and can work without the need to be pair to a companion device, thanks to the proprietary LG Smartwatch Platform. The LG Smartwatch platform is based on Palm’s WebOS and that gives LG Urbane LTE additional feature like being able to run apps, make phone calls, send messages and even use the watch as a walkie-talkie all without the need to pair to a smartphone. The Urbane LTE also supports NFC payments. The extra features in the Urbane LTE also means that it gets two additional buttons that allows you to navigate the interface much like an Android smartphone. You get one button for home, one button to navigate back and one button to open the menu options. While the standard Urbane running on Android Wear takes some time to get used to, the Urbane LTE is much easier to use thanks to the intuitive operating system and the three navigation buttons, despite having more features and options. On the inside, the Urbane is essentially a phone on your wrist. You get a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor with either 512MB of RAM in the standard version or 1GB of RAM in the LTE version, and both get 4GB of on board storage. You also get WiFi, NFC, GPS, a 9-axis motion sensor, a heart sensor and even a Barometer built into the device. The standard version is powered by a 410mAh battery and the LTE version gets a larger 700mAh unit. Because of the LTE radio and bigger battery, the Urbane LTE is noticeably thicker than the standard version, and this may be an issue for the ladies because the extra mass in the Urbane LTE can feel bulky on smaller wrists. Both the Urbane and Urbane LTE are IP67 rated which means they are completely dust proof and water proof in freshwater up to 1 meter in depth and can be submerged for up to 30 minutes. The Urbane LTE will require you to subscribe to a dedicated data plan which is fine but I don’t like that the SIM card has to be embedded into the watch permanently by the operator. That means the SIM card is not user removable, which is weird because it means you will have to take the device back to the shop just to get a SIM card replaced, and that’s a major hassle. Beyond that, The LTE version offers additional functionality that you can appreciate and the LG Urbane is a solid smartwatch that looks really good and is packed with useful features. That’s a pretty bold statement."

Lenovo says the Vibe Shot aims at blending a great camera experience in a smartphone frame, rather reminiscent of the time when compact cameras were the in-thing. The Vibe Shot is built around a 5 inch 1080p display and has Gorilla Glass on both the front and back for added protection. Under the hood, there is a 64-bit Snadragon 615 chipset running the show with 3GB RAM as well as 32GB expandable storage and a non-removable 2,900mAh battery. The smartphone will come with  Android 5.0 Lollipop  out of the box as well. 
 Out back you will find a 16 megapixel camera with a six piece modular lens and tri-colour LED flash has features low-light back illumination and optical image stabilization as well as a 8 megapixel front camera, which is amazing stuff as far as phone cameras are concerned.  So far the Vibe Shot is looking very slick at a thickness of a mere 7.3mm with a metal body and yet still manages to hold not one but two nano-SIM slots, and will have 3G and LTE capabilites. The Lenovo Vibe Shot will be expected to launch in June 2015 at a retail price of $349 (about RM1266) in grey, white and red. [ SOURCE ,  1 ]"

The Glyph is basically an amalgam of headphones combined with a VR headset built into the front (it looks like a plain thick set of headphones when not being worn) that you can plug any HDMI video source into; be it your computer or your phone. The Glyph also has head-tracking so you can use it to experience 360-degree photos and photospheres as well as 360 degree videos. Of course the unit you see here isn’t the final product, as the nose pads have not been fully designed to comfortably accommodate the human gamut of noses yet as well as the appropriate lens covers for when you decide to use the Glyph like a regular pair of headphones.     Though what sets it apart from most VR headsets is that it uses micromirror projection technology instead of tiny LCDs or OLED displays. That way the image is effectively beamed into your eyes and does away with the need for pixels in the traditional way. What you apparently get then is a very sharp and detailed image; though the 45 degree field of view still needs work, though it’s already adequate for watching movies. The Avegant Glyph will be retailing at $600 (RM 2186) which is quite hard to swallow in terms of pricing but hopefully it will be revised when it’s time for it to hit the market. [ SOURCE ]"

The smartphone is a 5.5 inch with a IPS HD display and a 1.5GHz octa-core MediaTek chip attached to 2GB of RAM, with 8GB internal storage expandable via microSD slot. Aside from being dual-SIM ready and having LTE connectivity, it also sports a 8 megapixel rear shooter and a 5 megapixel front camera. Like the Vibe Shot, it packs a 2,900 mAh battery. The  Lenovo A7000 also has the surprising addition of Dolby ATMOS surround sound which according to Lenovo, works with headphones plugged in too. Maybe they are expecting users to watch lots of movies with the A7000?   The smartphone will be launching this month for $170 (about RM 616). Also making it’s debut was a 50 lumen pico projector aptly named the Pocket Projector which not only has dual speakers but it can be rotated 90 degrees to adjust viewing angle and is capable of projecting a display of up to 110 inches. It’s interesting that Lenovo would suddenly want to produce pico projectors considering they’re all but died out in terms of popularity. As far specs are concerned, it has a native resolution of 854 x 480 and a contrast ratio of 1000:1 which isn’t too bad unless you’re trying to watch stuff in broad daylight.  It can last about 2.5 hours on a single charge which means you could easily power through your favourite movie before you’re due for another charge.  And as far as streaming is concerned, you can either slot in a microSD card (up to 32GB) with your videos on it or connect it to your Android, iOS or Windows Phone device though it’s microUSB port and stream from there. The Pocket Projector will also hit the market this month for $199 (about RM 721) and can literally slip into your pocket. Question is, just how well would it fare? More images below.

More manufacturers are starting to adopt fingerprint unlocking on their flagship models as it offers greater sense of security that’s easy to set up and use. Most fingerprint scanners today are capacitive based, which leaves some room of being copied if one has a high resolution image of your fingerprint. To take biometric security to the next level, Qualcomm has announced Sense ID, a 3D based fingerprint scanning technology that utilises ultrasonic sound waves. This allows a higher detail capture within the outer layers of the skin which recognises more characterisics than normal scanners. With a deeper scan, this makes it tougher for possible spoofs or hacking. Furthermore, the ultrasonic scanner works with smart phones of various body materials, such as plastic, steel, aluminium and sapphire. So this means, smart phone makers can discreetly fit a fingerprint security feature without deliberately putting a physical scanner or fitting one into a physical home button.  Since it is a 3D scan, Sense ID would still work even when fingers are contaminated with sweat or condensation. So there should’t be any issues unlocking your phone while having a finger licking good meal. In terms of availability, Sense ID 3D fingerprint technology, will first be introduced on the latest Snapdragon 810 and Snapdragon 425 processors, and eventually it would be copatible with the rest of the Snapdragon 400, 600 and 800 family. Qualcomm says that you can find smart phones launched in the H2 2015 to carry Sense ID.  Watch the intro below below and you can read more about Sense ID over  here ."

Samsung has a come  a long way  from its “challenger brand” position to become one of the biggest brands in mobile in the world. While the design similarities of earlier Galaxy S models with Apple’s iPhones are clearly evident, the Galaxy S6 can never be confused for an iPhone 6 — at least I don’t think so. Samsung is working very hard to break the stigma of being a copycat brand, a brand that lacks ideas, one that is void of any creativity or purpose other than to blatantly copy its competitors and make tons of money from copycat products but can you really say that the Galaxy S6 is an iPhone 6 copy?. To be honest, I fail to see where the similarities are. Some say that the Galaxy S6’s metal frame is similar to the iPhone 6 but that’s like saying, any car with four wheels is a blatant copy of the Model T Ford. The point I’m trying to make here is that, when you have such a short time to develop products, paths are going to cross and you will have elements that look similar or seem to look similar. I’m not trying to make a case for Samsung, but I fail to see where they copy is happening or am I not perceptive enough? Let me know what you think. Is the Galaxy S6 an iPhone 6 copy or not?"

We’ve managed to run AnTuTu on our preview Galaxy and the numbers are impressive. The Galaxy S6 whoops every other device in the benchmark producing a score of over 67,000, making it the fastest smartphone on the planet at the moment. The S6 is faster than the Meizu MX4, the Galaxy Note 4 and the OnePlus One, and the Galaxy S6 is almost twice as fast as the Glaaxy S5 that it replaces. This is not by chance, the Galaxy S6 is packed with cutting edge internals. It’s the first smartphone the world to use a 14nm processor. In comparison, the fastest processor from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 810 — is still based on a 20nm process making it less power efficient on paper. This fast processor is then mated with 3GB DDR4 RAM that’s faster than DDR3 RAM that’s more commonly used in smartphones today.   To make the most out of the fast processor and fast ram, the Galaxy is the first device is the world to use a new type of storage technology developed by Samsung called Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.0.

Of course, benchmark scores is just one aspect of the device performance but it’s one important aspect and it gives you a very good indication of what the device is capable of, and right now, the Galaxy S6 is the best you can get.

Sponsored,11 Things you didn’t know about the GALAXY Note 4,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/03/11-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-galaxy-note-4/,"Android,Guide,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note 4,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Features,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 One Handed Operation,Samsung Keyboard,samsung malaysia,smart phone,Sound Detector,Tips,Voice Recorder,Wide Selfie","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-03-03,"This post is paid for by Samsung Mobile Malaysia and the Galaxy Note 4. Do you Note? So you’ve gotten a  GALAXY Note 4  and you probably wonder what else could you do with it. With a powerful processor, improved S-Pen stylus and a vibrant 5.7″ Quad HD display, this is still the king of phablets which is now in its 4th generation. To get going immediately, here are the Top 11 features which you may not know you can do on your GALAXY Note 4.  Head after the break to get started.  The GALAXY Note 4’s Quad HD display is incredibly clear but at 5.7 inches, it is quite a stretch for those with smaller hands. Fortunately there’s a built-in feature where it resizes the display so that each corner is reachable with your thumb. There’s also on-screen buttons for home, back and recent apps.  How-to : Settings > Display and wallpaper > One-handed operation > Reduce screen size. To resize, just swipe from the preferred edge towards the centre and then back to the same edge quickly.  If you don’t want to sacrifice on having a smaller screen, you still can make it easy for single handed operations by enabling the Side Key Panel. This is basically a floating panel which gives you one touch access for the main physical buttons (Home, Back & Recent Apps). You can also adjust the transparency or move it around, so that it won’t block the vital areas of your current apps. How-to : Settings > Display and wallpaper > One-handed operation > Side Key Panel.  Why view one app at a time when you can view more? The GALAXY Note 4 supports Multi-Window multitasking where you can split 2 apps in a single view. On the GALAXY Note 4, there are couple of ways to do this: From the recent apps screen or by long pressing the “Back” button. Alternatively you could also drag a floating app (activated by dragging from a top corner of an app) to either top or bottom of the screen.   How-to : Settings > Multi Window The keyboard is mightier than the mouse and the GALAXY Note 4 default keyboard is more useful than you think. The top row of numeric keys can be programmed into any text you want with hot keys. You can use it for short replies and hashtags or as long as your full home address.  How-to : Settings > Language and input > Samsung keyboard (gear icon) > My hot keys The next time if you have a meeting, why not record the conversation as a back up for taking notes. Instead of the usual single track audio recording, the GALAXY Note 4 has a special Meeting Mode which is smart enough to identify up to 8 difference voices from different direction. After recording, you are able to mute specific speakers or listen to specific ones when you are listening to the playback. If it is a two way conversation, there’s a more simplified Interview mode as well. How-to : Apps > Voice Recorder  Selfies are a big thing these days and taking a larger group of people in a single shot can be a challenge. Instead of pulling out a cumbersome selfie stick, the Galaxy Note 4 comes with Wide Selfie mode which takes a wider 120 degree panorama selfie. To take the shot, it is as easy as taking the front shot, then followed by tilting the phone to the left and right slowly. The result is impressive and you level up your selfie shots by doing something like below.  
 Holding a phablet device can be a stretch, and it could be challenging to take the picture normally in a single hand. Instead of trying tap on screen, you could take the selfie shot easier by tapping on the heart rate sensor instead.  How-to : When you’re using the front facing camera, just tap on the heart rate sensor at the back lightly to take the shot. Do you have a setting that you frequently need to change? Whether it is flight mode, NFC, Bluetooth or Download Booster, you can make these toggles easier to reach by customising the Quick Settings list on the notification bar.   You can set a total of 10 active buttons from a total of 21 options.  How-to : Use two fingers to drop down the notification bar > tap on the edit (Pencil icon) button > drag and drop your preferred options.  If your home or office internet is down and you need connection right away, you can always depend on your GALAXY Note 4 as your emergency back up. By enabling Mobile hotspot, you can turn your Galaxy Note 4 as a portable WiFi connection and you can share it with up to 10 other devices. Just take note that this would utilise your current mobile plans, so take note that you would need a bigger data plan if you are going to use this a lot.  How-to : Settings > Tethering and Mobile hotspot > Mobile Hotspot This is quite a hidden trick which is quite interesting to highlight. Buried under its accessibility settings, there’s a sound detector feature which gives you visual and vibrating alerts if it detects a door bell or hears the sound of a crying baby. This is actually designed for people with hearing disabilities but it can be useful for moments when you’re expecting someone at home while having headphones on. How-to : Settings > Accessibility > Hearing > Sound Detectors During emergencies, you would want your loved ones to be informed with your situation and current location. On the GALAXY Note 4, you can easily send a distress call for help along with vital information with minimal input. The Safety Assistance feature can be triggered by pressing the power button repeatedly 3 times. Once you’ve selected your emergency contacts, you can also add the option to include your current GPS location, immediate photos taken from both cameras as well as a short audio recording. So if you ever get into trouble, you can call for help with vital info with a simple triple press action.  How-to : Settings > Safety Assistance"
Sirap Bandung,Xiaomi outs their super-tiny action camera,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/02/xiaomi-outs-their-super-tiny-action-camera/,"Action Camera,Xiaomi,xiaomi Yi action camera,yi action camera","Mobile Accessories,Xiaomi",2015-03-02,"Xiaomi  has unveiled their  super tiny action camera  which they had teased in images last week that might just give GoPro a run for it’s money. The camera, dubbed the Xiaomi “Yi Action Camera” is just a fraction of the price of an entry level GoPro which retails for about roughly $130 (RM 471) this one comes in at just 399 yuan which translates to just RM 230.   The camera will be able to record videos at 1080p at 60 frames per second and houses a 16 megapixel camera using Sony’s Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor which is better than what most entry level action cams have to offer. The Yi Action Camera will also be super light at 72g and has 64GB internal storage a well as the ability to take a dip up to 40 meters. The Beijing based company also says that the camera will be compatible with a host of accessories (like bicycle mounts and even on a pet cam holster) and will have their own line of accessories of it’s own in the near future. On top of that, it will also have a remote shutter app that operates through WiFi to share and store photos and videos taken with the tiny camera. As it is, they already have what they call a ‘travel package’ set that will set you back 499 yuan (RM 288) that comes with pretty tough looking selfiepod for those who enjoy taking selfies. From what we can tell the device seems to be limited to China for now but it will likely be available on  Mi.com  during Xiaomi’s usual flash sales. [ SOURCE] [ VIA ]"
Sirap Bandung,Huawei debuts two entry level smartphones the Y360 and Y635,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/01/huawei-debuts-two-entry-level-smartphones-the-y360-and-y635/,"Android,Android KitKat,Android Lollipop,huawei,huawei Y360,huawei Y635,mobile devices,MWC,MWC 2015,smart phone,smartphone","huawei,Mobile Devices",2015-03-01,"Two more additions to  Huawei’s  entry level family tree have surfaced at MWC, namely the Huawei Y635 and the Y360. Generally speaking the Huawei Y635 looks set to be an entry-level 4G LTE phone while the Y360 will be it’s slightly more basic sibling. The Huawei Y635 comes in at the 5 inch mark with a 854×480 resolution 195 ppi screen and sports a 1.2GHz quad-core processor under the hood as well as a rather healthy 2,000 mAh battery. It will also feature 4GB internal memory that’s extendable via microSD. There are a lot of similarities between the two smartphones but what sets the Y635 apart from it’s sibling is that has 1GB of RAM and is supposed to have Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box and that it will have 4G LTE capabilities. More after the break. Inside the Huawei Y360 on the other hand, you will find the same frugal 1.2GHz quad-core processor attached to a rather meager 512MB RAM. There’s also 4GB storage expandable via microSD and you will be getting a 4 inch, 854×480 resolution screen with 244 ppi that’s somewhat better than the Y635’s screen. The Y360 is lacking in the 4G LTE department as well but that could well be for the sake of keeping the price down. Huawei mentioned that the phone will be on Android 4.4.4 KitKat out of the box and will sport Huawei’s “Emotion UI” interface. As for the camera, the Y360 will sport a 5 megapixel rear snapper with a 2 megapixel camera on the front, and you also get a substantial 2,000 mAh removable battery. Huawei wasn’t showcasing any working units for this model so this is all we might know for now. So far Huawei has not confirmed any availability of pricing for the two smartphones, but there’s a high chance they will be very competitively priced.

soyacincau,Samsung Galaxy S6: A stunning flagship reboot,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/02/samsung-galaxy-s6-a-stunning-flagship-reboot/,"Android,MWC 2015,Project Zero,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Hands-on,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 Hands-on,Samsung Galaxy S6 Launch,Samsung Galaxy S6 Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy S6 Spec,samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2015,Samsung Unpacked 2015,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-03-02,"Anticipation is running high for Samsung , which has been the flag bearer for Android smart phones. With mounting competition from affordable alternatives and Apple showing no signs of slowing down, Samsung is shaken to take a bold step to maintain its position. They had taken necessary initiatives to shed its imitator image and to move up the premium game with the use of premium materials like they did with the Galaxy Alpha, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy A series. For the next Galaxy, Samsung had embarked on a full reboot with what they call Project Zero. Going back to the drawing board, the Korean smart phone maker aspires to create something new, with a fresh new slate aiming to set a whole new standard for smart phones. For the exterior, Samsung experimented with new manufacturing processes to create a fresh yet stylish design, while its internals are optimised to give a superior performance with help from its own Samsung subsidiaries. The result, is the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and its display technology showcase model, the Galaxy S6 edge. The new Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge are stunningly beautiful. At first glance, the metal frames and all glass exterior does remind you of an iPhone but upon closer inspection, it looks and feels much more refined, plus the colour options of the device makes it stand out from the typical black and white slabs in the market. Samsung has definitely stepped up in the design department and the new model looks years ahead from the Galaxy S5 which looks ridiculously cheap when put side by side. There are total of 4 colours available – Blue, White, Gold and Black. The Galaxy S6 edge shares the same colour options but it gets an exclusive dark Green option which we liked the most. For the display, the Galaxy S6 edge has a curved area on both the left and right, but compared to the Galaxy Note Edge, it doesn’t extend all the way to the sides, which makes it possible for side button placements, for better single handed use. The front retains the iconic Samsung home button that’s accompanied with the usual recent apps and back buttons. On the left, it gets a volume rocker with a metallic finish while the right gets a power/wake button. Like most new flagship smart phones, it now uses nano-SIM with the slot located on the right for the Galaxy S6 while the Galaxy S6 edge is placed right at the top. At the top side, the device looks clean with a infra-red blaster at the top with a secondary mic, while the bottom of the device houses a microUSB port, headphone jack and a loud speaker grill, which claims to be 1.5X louder than its predecessor. Looking at the back, the body colour glass dominates the whole surface with a centre mounted protruding camera, which is more exaggerated than the latest iPhones. The heart rate sensor is now placed vertically on the right, similar to the Galaxy Alpha. Dimension wise, both models are lighter and thinner than the current Galaxy S5 despite the usage of heavier materials such as metal and glass. The standard S6 is 6.8mm thick and it weighs 138 grams, while the edge version is slightly thicker at 7.0mm but it manages to trim some fat, weighing in at 132grams. Both the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge are identical. The only difference is the “double edge” display, a slightly larger battery and dimension differences on the Galaxy S6 edge version. The front gets a 5.1” Quad HD (2560×1440) Super AMOLED display which pushes an impressive pixel density of 577 ppi (pixels per inch). For better outdoor visibility, the screen has a max brightness of 600cd/m2. Powering the device is the world’s first 14nm mobile processor –Samsung’s own 64-bit (Cortex A-57 @2.1GHz + Cortex A-53 @ 1.5GHz) Octa-Core Exynos 7420 processor. With a much finer 14nm process (Snapdragon 810: 20nm), this provides better performance while having greater power efficiency in theory. It appears that Samsung is confident with their in-house supply that they have decided to drop a Qualcomm variant altogether. To remove any potential speed bumps, the Galaxy S6 will be having 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a much faster UFS 2.0 flash memory for its on-board storage that claims to be 30% faster than standard eMMC 5.0 flash that’s being used on most high-end smart phones in the market. Storage wise, Samsung has killed the tiny 16GB option and the new flagship will come in either 32GB, 64GB and a whopping 128GB capacity version. Unfortunately with its unibody design, they had to forego a microSD slot. If you need more space, Samsung is offering additional 100GB of OneDrive cloud storage for free for 2 years. Imaging is one of the key highlights of the Galaxy S6. The camera on the current Galaxy Note 4 is already impressive and Samsung has taken it further with a dual f/1.9 bright lens for both front and back, as well as support for Auto Real Time HDR. The main camera is a 16MP shooter assisted with Optical Image Stabilisation while the front gets a larger 5MP unit. To capture moments instantly, the Galaxy S6 is able to launch the camera app in 0.7 seconds by simply double tapping the home button quickly. This can be trigger in any situation even while the device is in sleep. Too bad all it does is to launch the app and there’s no way to enable a direct Sleep to Snap function. According to Samsung, they had decided not to do so to avoid accidental shots, but we reckon it would be great to have that option available. Since we’re on the home button, Samsung has improved its fingerprint functionality with a 360 degree one touch method, similar to the iPhone’s Touch ID and Huawei Ascend Mate 7. This allows you to unlock the device by tapping your finger in any direction, which is a whole lot better than the old school downward swiping motion. With a Quad HD display and a more powerful processor, we would typically expect larger battery capacity. Surprisingly Samsung downsized to a smaller 2,550mAh unit for the Galaxy S6 and a slightly bigger 2,600mAh unit for the S6 edge. As comparison, the Galaxy S5 has 2,800mAh capacity while the older S4 has a 2,600mAh. According to Samsung, its processor, RAM and storage have been tweaked for greater power efficiency and it should be able to provide a similar battery life as the current Galaxy S5. To get you up and going, the Galaxy S6 also receives Adaptive Fast Charging which does 0-50% charge in 30 minutes. A quick 10 minute charge apparently is good enough to provide 2 hours of HD video playback. Also for the first time, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge will support native wireless charging. To make it compatible with a wide range of chargers, it will support both WPC/PMA wireless standards. Obviously this would be better for convenience and if you’re in a hurry, the good old USB cable would be a quicker option. For the Galaxy S6 edge, the “edge” functionality is rather limited compared to the Galaxy Note Edge. You don’t get a dedicated shortcut or dynamic panel bars, which is obviously hindered with its smaller curve extension. Instead, the main highlight is its “People Edge” functionality to keep up to 5 of your favourite contacts within an edge reach. When enabled, a slight colour tab appears on the side which you can drag to bring out your contact to view missed calls and you can call or message tap instantly with a single tap. Whether you’re left or right handed, you can move the active edge to your preferred side. When the display is asleep, it also doubles up as a night clock and an info stream to peek on missed notifications. Another gimmick which has been teased before the launch, is the glowing edge light. For each contact, you can assign a unique colour for easy identification. During meetings, when the Galaxy S6 edge is facing down, the edge will flash the colour of your contact, which gives you a visual alert of who’s calling, without revealing it on the front screen. Should you decide to reject the call, you can press and hold onto the heart rate sensor, and it would hang up the call and send a preset message to the said contact. The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge is a positive step forward for Samsung and it looks like they have nailed the exterior and the hardware side of things. The new polished metal frame, choice of having glass on both sides and an instant Touch-ID like unlock, could also be seen as copying Apple, and that’s a perception that Samsung would want to tackle. The premium design is something you should see in the flesh, as it is something that you would need to hold and feel first hand to appreciate it. For the Galaxy S6 edge, it doesn’t differ much from the standard Galaxy S6 and it would be tough to justify it for the limited edge functionality if Samsung decides to charge a huge premium like the Galaxy Note Edge over the standard Note 4. For the Malaysian market, we expect Samsung to offer the base 32GB storage option for the standard Galaxy S6 and perhaps they might offer the S6 edge locally with a larger 64GB or 128GB storage capacity as a key differentiation. In terms of availability, do expect Malaysia to be among the first countries to get it,  and it could be as early as end of this month  and it will be available starting 10th April.

The Huawei CarFi is a WiFi dongle that you can plug into your car to create a 4G LTE hotspot with a download speed of up to 150Mbps and 50Mbps upload with support for up to 10 devices simultaneously, for those long hauls across the country. Simply plug it in, slot in your SIM card and it handles the rest, but it looks like you probably have to use it in conjunction with Huawei’s HiLink App. It also has a handy USB slot which you can use to charge your devices so you won’t miss your car charger. Since the theme is “where speed meets style” Huawei even made it fire-proof with a coating of carbon fiber which makes it look very sleek indeed though we do hope you’ll never need to put the fire proof aspect to the test. No idea when we will be getting it locally but it apparently will be priced at €149 (RM603). Video and images after the break.

Turns out the majority of the leaked info about HTC’s latest flagship were actually quite spot on, with very minimal change in terms of design down to the point it looks almost identical to the  One M8 , which is a little disappointing considering there wasn’t that much innovation in terms of design. What you’ll be getting is an aluminium unibody with a distinct dual-toned silver and rose gold finish, combined with a 5-inch 1080p display that’s flanked by HTC’s BoomSound speakers on the top and the bottom. There’s a few differences but they’re mostly subtle enough that you won’t spot them at first. The One M9 is a tad bit chubbier than the One M8 at 9.61 mm thick but it is tiny bit lighter than it’s predecessor. More after the break. The One M9 does get a series of bumps in terms of hardware, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 octa-core under the hood which is attached to a healthy 3GB of RAM as well as Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. The battery life has been given an upgrade as well, with a slightly larger 2,840 mAh battery that should last longer with the SD 810’s more efficient power consumption. The smartphone will still be utilizing HTC’s Sense skin so you may or may not notice any difference between the latest Android versions either. HTC looks to have completely nixed it’s UltraPixel tech from it’s rear camera, instead opting for a conventional 20 megapixel camera with a f/2.2, 27.8mm lens with 4K video recording. The UltraPixel tech has instead migrated to the front facing camera in favour of better and more natural low light shots and selfies alike. There will also be the option of an IP68 water resistant Active Case and Active Headset for those with more active lifestyles. Everything considered the HTC One M9 does appear to be better than it’s predecessor, even if it does look a bit clone-ish in design. We don’t have pricing yet but the HTC One M9 will be available from mid-March onwards in single-tone gunmetal grey and single-tone gold on top of the iconic dual-toned version. Check out more images of the HTC One M9 below."

Sony unleashed a slew of give Z-series flagships in the last year alone, so it’s a little strange that they’ve totally forgone showing off a new flagship product but instead has brought in a new full sized tablet. This is the successor of the  Xperia Z2  tablet, which was the brand’s last full sized tablet and it brings some upgrades with it. The Xperia Z4 tablet has a 10.1 inch Quad HD IPS display (2560 x 1600) with a pixel density of 300ppi with Sony’s Triluminous tech and X-Reality Mobile engine which is a staple for their newer tablets. It will also house an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor mated to 3GB RAM, a 8.1 megapixel ExmorRS rear camera and a 5.1 megapixel front snapper as well as a 6000mAh battery. In terms of storage it will have 32GB expandable memory and will be powered by Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. They’ve also managed to make it as slim as the iPad Air 2 at a extremely skinny 6.1mm as well as wee bit lighter as it’s now a good 50g lighter than it’s predecessor. There will also be an optional keyboard dock that will technically make the Z4 tablet into a notebook considering that the tablet comes bundled with Microsoft’s Android Office. The Xperia Z4 Tablet doesn’t have a pricing yet but it will be available starting June this year. We are in Barcelona for  MWC 2015  so stay tuned for more information as it comes. [ SOURCE ,  1 ]"
Amin Ashaari,"HTC One M9: Impressive quality, incremental improvements, nothing special",http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/03/02/htc-one-m9-impressive-quality-incremental-improvements-nothing-special/,"HTC,HTC One,HTC One M9,HTC One M9 Launch,HTC One M9 Malaysia,MWC,MWC 2015,MWC15","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-03-02,"HTC took the covers off its latest flagship smartphone — the One M9 — but after numerous, very accurate leaks, it’s hard to get really excited about the device especially when I expected a lot more from it, based on the hype created by HTC. In this case, while the build up towards the M9’s launch was impressive, the device itself didn’t really meet my expectations but before we go into that, let’s talk about what the One M9 brings to the table. The most luxurious smartphone experience 
HTC’s goal when designing the M9 was to create the brand’s most beautiful and powerful smartphone ever. At least that’s what they want you to feel and to a certain extent, the M9 meets that description — it is beautiful and it is powerful. The hairline brushed metal finish is gorgeous to look at and in your hands, the device feels like fine jewelry, like it belongs in a display cabinet at Tiffany. This is not by chance, HTC engineers cut no corners in making sure that the M9 is the most stylish and well-built smartphone you can get. Each HTC One M9 takes 300 minutes to make, going over a 70-step process.  If that’s not detailed enough, at the end of this process, each One M9 is then finished by hand to produce a fine, jewelry grade, scratch-resistant finish. This makes the M9 a joy to hold, and with its dual-tone silver and rose gold coloured finish, you will want to hold the phone all day long to show off just how exquisite it is. I know I would and that’s how special the HTC One M9 is to look at.  Yes, the One M9 looks like the One M8 looks like the One M7 but that’s not such a bad thing considering the HTC One series has always been among the more tastefully design smartphones out there, so why change a good thing? I’m willing to overlook the fact that the brand new One M9 looks virtually identical to the One M8 that was released a year a go but I can’t understand why the M9 is incredible and impressive in some aspects but so incremental and flawed in areas where it matters. I wished that the HTC engineers spent more time in cramming as much tech as possible into the M9 as they did with designing a beautiful phone. A spec sheet that doesn’t impress 
On paper, I’m not impressed with what the HTC One M9 has to offer and let me tell you why. The 5-inch display is only a 1080p unit pushing a pixel density of just 440ppi — that’s basically the same as the outgoing One M8. On the inside, you get a 64-bit Snapdragon 810 octa-core processor (4 cores x 2GHz + 4 cores x 1.5GHz). There’s 3GB of RAM and 32GB of on board storage, and there’s also a micro SD card slot that’s capable of taking cards up to 128GB in capacity. The specifications are current with what other brands are offering but it doesn’t better them, and for a device that’s supposed to beat all of them, the One M9 needs to pack much more. The problem is, the M9 doesn’t. Where’s the wow factor? 
You might think that the 20MP Sapphire lens rear camera is something you can shout home about and, to be honest, I thought so too. I wanted the camera to be the wow factor. The one thing that would convince me to recommend the phone to you. I was hoping that after a long line of beautiful phones with awful cameras, the HTC engineers would finally give the One series a camera that matches its beautiful design — I was wrong. Despite the 20MP rear camera and a decently fast f/2.2 lens, the One M9 continues HTC’s tradition of woefully bad camera performance. While pictures in normal light look ok, the One M9 struggles in low light. The M9 struggles when taking pictures taken when the lights are dim or less than ideal. Images come out noisy with grainy details and washed out colours. The UltraPixel camera on the front is no better either. Considering how bad the camera is, it’s funny that the M9 is capable of shooting images in RAW and videos in 4K resolution. So what’s better? 
For one, the battery is slightly bigger — 2,840mAh in the One M9 over 2,600mAh in the One M8. I feel the BoomSound speakers are better too, now with Dolby Surround support giving you exceptional sound staging, quality and volume that is the best that you can get from a smartphone. The One M9 is now a true world phone as well, with support for 21 LTE bands on both the FDD and TDD sides of the divide, you also get Cat 9 LTE for download speeds over 450Mbps and upload speeds upwards of 50Mbps and VoLTE should your network support it. The HTC Sense UI has been improved as well but it not anything groundbreaking, just incremental updates here and there. You’ll notice these updates if you own the M9 but if your’re casually playing with the M9 in store thinking whether you should buy it over the competition, then the improved Sense UI feels just like the previous iteration. It’s nice and clean but nothing special. Now in its seventh iteration, the Sense UI brings deep themes customisation allowing you to change almost every aspect of the look and feel of the UI. The UI can also adapt and customise themes for you based on the picture that you use as a wallpaper. Another enhancement is HTC’s BlinkFeed app. BlinkFeed is now location aware and will present to you recommendations on places of interest, news and other relevant info depending on your location, but I wouldn’t call that feature special and it’s not like it’s nothing Google Now can’t do. You also get some updated effects and filters in the camera app and you can download more filters and effects, which is nice but , again, is not anything groundbreaking. What’s missing? 
Where do I start with this? Comparing the One M9 with its direct competitors, the HTC flagship is decidedly bare bones. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no super hi-res display, no ultra-long battery life. It’s not water resistant, there’s no curvy, flexible screen as well. And while the latest Sense UI is the most refined ever, there’s really nothing special for you to show off to your friends the next time you head down to the mamak. But hey, at least the M9 looks good right?  This is not the one you’re looking for 
So at the end of the day, what do I think about the HTC One M9? I think its beautiful to look at and wonderful to hold but I also think for HTC to succeed, the One M9 need to be more than just good looking. A lot more."

Huawei is definitely going for the premium look for both their wearables, including the  Talkband B2  also launched today. The watch has a circular display and looks very similar to a classical luxury timepiece and sports a sapphire crystal screen as well as a stainless steel housing that’s apparently cold forged and 40% stronger than it’s non-cold forged counterparts. Users will have the choice between a metal or leather strap and the watch will be available in gold, silver and black. The watch itself has a compact 42mm face and a standard 18mm lug width and will come with the usual bells and whistles that most smartwatches are associated with, including a heart rate monitor and fitness tracking as well as a 6-axis motion sensor and barometric sensor. It’s display will be a 1.4 inch AMOLED screen with a 400×400 screen resolution with 286 ppi and a 10:000:1 high contrast ratio. The watch face is also fully customizable, and as luck would have it, Huawei will be providing over 40 different watch faces with the Watch. The Watch will be available sometime “in the middle of this year” in 20 countries which unfortunately doesn’t include Malaysia but Singapore will be getting it so it could be just a matter of time before it hits our market as well.

The first video is basically an promo ad which showcases the watch in action. It clearly shows the Huawei Watch running on Android Wear and it has a built-in heart rate tracker as well.  Huawei has also shared a design story in their next video where it highlights its focus on creating a smart watch that has a premium timeless look while offering smart features when you need it. The video is quite fluffy and you can tell most of the participants are paid actors. Videos aside, the Huawei Watch looks like a serious contender against the Moto 360 and even the LG Urbane. The last wearable device they had was the  TalkBand B1  which  launched  during last year’s MWC. Apart from the new Watch, Huawei is expected to released a couple of more wearables that would join the TalkBand line of hybrid bluetooth headset products.

It does look very similar in design to the original Liquid Leap and has the very same colourful aesthetics to go with it in the form of vibrant rubberised bands. The fitness tracker is IPX7 certified water resistant and operates via low-energy Bluetooth 4.0. The tracker features a one-inch OLED touchscreen as there are no physical buttons and navigates via swipe motions.

No word on Malaysian availability yet.   Heads up, the  Samsung Galaxy S6  could hit Malaysia by the end of this month. The Sprint promo image  here  hints that the Samsung Galaxy S6 might be available on the 26th of March if the offer end date on the teaser  indicated by “Offer ends 3/26/15″ is true. The promo indicated you could win one of six Galaxy S6 smartphones if you pre-registered for the announcement, so it’s not too far out to assume the end date is in fact the actual launch date. Samsung tends to launch their devices globally, based on previous Galaxy flagship launches and as a key market Malaysia should be among the first to get it. Of course, expect our big telcos to be offering the device as well. You can expect the S6 and S6 Edge to feature an  all-new metal-framed  body with  possibly dual front facing speakers  and an array of new colour options — blue, gold, white and grey plus a never before seen  green colour option  for the Galaxy S6 Edge. Leaks suggest that Samsung will be using a more advanced on board storage unit built in house by Samsung to offer a considerably faster read and write speeds over previous memory. We expect Samsung to drop the 16GB option that’s been a staple in its device line up and replace it with 32GB, 62GB and 128GB options.

The Huawei B2 looks like a smartwatch for the fashion conscious, that want a more stylish kind of smartwatch perched on their wrist and they’ve given it a few much needed tweaks as well. The TalkBand B1 was a lot more chunky rubber than the B2, with more sophisticated angles and thinner by comparison, with a choice between black, silver or champagne gold. The first two colours come with a similar rubber strap but the champagne gold version will have a brown leather strap instead. Unlike it’s predecessor, the B2 now has a touch surface for navigation and will be able to swipe through screens to show the time, stopwatch, sleep tracker, pedometer and calorie monitoring, which essentially makes it more of a fancy fitness tracker than a smartwatch but we digress. The earpiece has gotten a tweak too, now you can’t just pop it out direct from the case but rather you have to press two buttons to get it out, and you now have to plug your micro-USB straight into the smartwatch as they have removed the charging port on the strap. In terms of battery life the TalkBand B2 will give you about seven hours of talk time or five days as an activity tracker with Android and iOS compatibility.

Now we can confirm that the speculation of a  different design  isn’t true and it matches the alleged  official press photos  that we’ve seen earlier. The main noticeable difference is on the sides, where it gets a dual-tone metal frame and the power button is now moved to the right below the individual up and down volume buttons. Meanwhile, the back retains a similar brushed metal look but it gets a single 20MP main camera instead of a duo camera set up on the One M8. The dual-tone LED flash has been retained as well. For selfies, the same old 4MP Ultra-Pixel that debut on the One M7 has been moved to the front. From its  earlier leaked specs , the HTC One M9 will retain the same 5.0″ Full HD display but underneath it will runs on the latest Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM. On-board it gets 32GB of storage and there’s also a microSD slot which accept cards up to 128GB. In the battery department, the One M9 is said to get a larger 2,900mAh capacity battery, which is 300mAh more than the previous One M8 but it gets a slightly thicker dimensions of 9.61mm.  Overall, the One M9 doesn’t seems to be a radical all-new model but a mere update, like an iPhone 4S is to the iPhone 4. If you’re using a HTC One M8, are you enticed to upgrade to a device that looks identical from the front?

The “Flashback” line of apparel as it is called is a  partially crowdfunded project  which hopefully will be bringing the actual articles of clothing to the market. Each piece of clothing looks like an ordinary pieces of gray clothing under normal lighting but the material is actually coated with millions of tiny “glass nanospheres” that causes the material to reflect tremendous amounts of light back at camera sensors to create terribly underexposed images. Video and more images after the break Here is the $70 (RM252)  Silver-Screen Scarf The $205 (RM740)  Photobomber Hoodie The $406  Illuminati Suit Jacket  (RM 1466)and $228 (RM823)  Illuminati Suit Pants And finally the $50 (RM180) Halo Hat . 
You can check out how exactly Flashback clothes are meant to work with this video: While the idea is a good and and the smart materials are undoubtedly pretty next gen, some photographers aren’t convinced with how well it would work, plus the material seems to be prohibitively expensive. The clothes themselves probably won’t be much of a deterrent for seasoned photographers and those who aren’t using flash to begin with or have the appropriate equipment; the clothes will most likely be functional in ruining the images of those who crowd around with their smartphones and fire flashes indiscriminately in hopes of nailing a picture. So far the hoodie and the scarf are the two products that have received enough backing to officially start shipping to the public starting August 2015, the rest will come if they can manage to garner enough funding before the campaign ends in about two weeks time. Interested parties can preorder  the clothing through  BetaBrand . [ SOURCE ]"

The same type of nylon corners for durability can be seen. Other features we can see are a dedicated camera button, along with the signature power button and microSD port flap.” The site says that the device in question could be the Xperia M4 Aqua, that is rumoured to feature a 5.2-inch (720 x 1280) display, 2GB RAM, 13MP rear camera, 5MP front-facing camera and Android 5.0 Lollipop.

A total of 3 colour options are shown – Silver, Gold and Black, each with a different band material. The hero product which is shown above features a metal strap that looks similar to  Apple Watch ‘s Milanese Loop option.  In terms of OS, it is shown to be running on Android Wear and that’s all we know about the watch for now. Huawei will be announcing the new Watch along probably with a couple of new tablets this Sunday at 1:30PM (8:30PM Malaysian) time.  Click on the image below for the full size.  [  SOURCE  ]"
ccsoya,Highly detailed renderings give us a very good look at the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge?,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/28/highly-detailed-rendering-gives-us-a-very-good-look-at-the-samsung-galaxy-s6/,"Mobile World Congress,Mobile World Congress 2015,MWC 2015,MWC15,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S6,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge,Samsung Unpacked,Samsung Unpacked 2015,Unpacked","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-02-28,"CNet Korea has obtained what looks like highly detailed rendering of the upcoming  Galaxy S6 Edge  based on actual specifications of the device. The renders gives us a highly detailed look at what is Samsung’s most important smartphone in recent times. If the information used to create these renders are real, the Galaxy S6 Edge looks to be a very sleek device with the dual edge screen giving it a ultra-cool factor. It will be interesting to see what new features Samsung will incorporate into the new user interface to make the most out of the dual edge screen. The render suggests that the S6 Edge will feature a unibody design instead of the two-piece construction that is a trademark of almost all Samsung devices currently available in the market. The unibody design offers the additional benefit of being robust and strong but it will also mean that the S6 will not have a removable battery like previous other Samsung smartphones. The render also shows a rear camera that protrudes out of the back panel it an attempt to make the device as thin as possible. In my opinion, this is an unnecessary trade-off as I would rather have a camera that sits flush with the back panel rather than one that protrudes as seen in the render because a protruding camera exposes itself to nicks and scratches. A slightly thicker device is anytime better than having scratches on the lens of the device. Whether these renders are the real deal or not, everything will be  revealed on March 1  and we will be at the launch event to give you the latest updates, so stay tuned. In the meantime, head on over to after the jump for more renders of the Galaxy S6 Edge. Click for larger image [ source ,  via ]"

In addition, the One M9 is said to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 octa-core processor and to have a 5-inch Quad HD display, a 20 MP rear camera, 5 MP front-facing camera, 3 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of expandable storage space.

Both devices have been  leaked extensively  and it marks Samsung’s fresh approach for their high-end smart phone.   Lewis, the  iPhone 6 Plus bender  from UnboxedTherapy has shared more exclusive details for both devices. If you’re clueless on what to expect, read on to find out what we know so far about the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge.  Design 
Samsung is trying hard to shed its old plasticky image of the past. After introducing its  Galaxy Alpha ,  Galaxy Note 4  and  Galaxy A  series with a metal frame, the new Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge will get a unibody aluminium frame that’s encased with glass for both front and back.  With that, the new device would be their most premium feeling smart phone to hold but it sacrifices a couple of things such as a removable battery and even a microSD slot. Another huge step back is the lack of water resistance, which came as standard on the  Galaxy S5 . The back features a protruding camera design which is said to be fitted with a f/1.9 lens for better low light imaging. The heart rate sensor, which is traditionally placed below the camera is now placed vertically on the right, similar to the Galaxy Alpha.   Hardware 
Both Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge are expected to be identical in terms of hardware. The front display is said to be a 5.1″ with a Quad HD resolution (2560×1440). Like the  Galaxy Note 4 , the new flagship will be using Corning’s latest  Gorilla Glass 4  that could withstand drops better. Apart from the double curve screen on both sides, the Galaxy S6 edge is reported to have a slightly larger battery capacity of about 50mAh. Powering the device will be an Exynos Octa-Core processor that’s  expected to be superior  than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 offering with greater performance while maintaining  thermal efficiency . In addition, it will be mated to 3GB of RAM, which is more than its previous Galaxy S models.  Probably the biggest addition is a built-in wireless charging feature and if we read their  teaser correctly , it could support adaptive fast charging as well. Another huge improvement would be its fingerprint scanner. On the current Galaxy models, Samsung still requires the old fashion swiping method which isn’t practical to use with a single hand. The new Galaxy S6 fingerprint scanner is said to be having a one-touch unlock similar to iPhone’s TouchID and Huawei’s Ascend Mate 7. Options 
The Galaxy S6 is  expected to be available  in Black, White, Gold and Blue colours. It is the same story for the Galaxy S6 edge but it gets an additional exclusive green colour option as well. Without a microSD slot, the on-board storage would be critical for users and it appears that Samsung would be releasing both models in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB storage capacities. The built-in storage, isn’t just your average run of the mill eMMC 5.0 memory and the Galaxy S6 will be using Samsung’s new  Universal Flash Storage  than claims to be up to 2.7X faster than other solutions.  That’s all we know for now and do follow us as we will be covering the Galaxy S6 launch in Barcelona. Keep it locked on to SoyaCincau.com for the latest coverage from MWC 2015.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The teaser pic shows a new tablet that’s slim, lighter and brighter. From its  small blunder , there’s little doubt that this would be its new  Xperia Z4 Tablet  which would replace its current full sized  Xperia Z2 Tablet . From what we know, the new Xperia Z4 Tablet will be having a 2K/Quad HD display that’s mated with the latest high-end processor and an industry’s longest battery life for a tablet. You can probably expect the latest Snapdragon 810 processor on-board and Sony’s extra-long battery life that was introduced with their current  Xperia Z3  smart phone. There’s  no Xperia Z4 flagship smart phone  this round, which is probably good news for those who prefer a single flagship model per year cycle. The new Sony tablet would be revealed next Monday as the doors of MWC 2015 official opens. Word has it that a smart phone would be released but it would be its mid-range  Xperia M4 Aqua .

This includes the ultra-chic 18-karat gold luxe edition, a rubber-strapped and brightly coloured sports edition and the leather-bound standard edition. True to Apple style, the ad pages look appropriately stylish that resemble jewelry advertising more that an ad for a smartwatch, and perhaps it needs to be for Apple to really differentiate its wearable over the many others that are available in the market right now.

The teasers on Xiaomi’s Weibo and their website shows us ending with a picture of a matchbox filled with luggage and a promise of more information next week. They have multiple teasers too, with each one showing a different kind of video and subsequently matchbox. Our best guess is that the Chinese brand is going to unveil  an action camera  of sorts, if the kind of video clips they are showing are any inkling. Currently  GoPro  is on top of the game in terms of action cameras, and the current one is roughly the size of a matchbox and very lightweight once taken out from it’s waterproof housing; and are great for use while on the go and when taking a dip. But at the same time, it could also possibly be something like  HTC’s handheld RE camera . GoPros are intensely popular and even Chinese cameras like the SJ5000 are widely used for extreme sports and as fly-by drone cameras. Action cameras range from around $100 to $500 so a Xiaomi or Mi camera could cost much, much less. Check out more images after the break.     [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

The  Nubia  brand tends to launch a new device every year and it’s usually around that time that we see a new flagship from the company, with the brand being ZTE’s answer to low price and high-performance devices that’s coming from  OnePlus ,  Honor  and  Xiaomi . According to reports, the latest Nubia device will be the Nubia Z9 which will feature a premium design and build similar to many of the newer Chinese smartphones. The image of the Nubia Z9 is from a promotional shoot  in which Jay Chou’s wife is seen holding the phone. Other details about the phone are still up to debate but the build looks like an all-glass design with possibly an alloy chassis and a display size of around 5.5-5.7 inches. The smartphone could also have a Snapdragon 810 chip, but it’s also possible for ZTE to use a Mediatek MT6795 processor  instead.

Now more details have surfaced regarding its storage capacities and colour options. In the previous Galaxy S series, they were announced with several storage options. However for us Malaysians, we often end up with the base 16GB model. Granted that you can expand it further with microSD, there are those who prefer more on-board storage to install more apps.  For the upcoming Galaxy S6, Samsung is said to be utilising a much faster  Universal Flash Storage  that’s capable of doing 19,000 input/output operations per second (IOPS). In simple terms, that’s 28X faster than conventional memory cards and 2.7X faster than eMMC 5.0 on-board memory that’s being used on most flagship smart phones today.  Overall, you can expect SSD-like performance with 50% less reduction in power consumption, which is probably what was teased in their  second video . The new UFS embedded memory is available in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB, which means that the Galaxy S6 would be offered with a minimum of 32GB storage, similar to the Galaxy Note 4.  In terms of colours, a  new leak  suggests that the Galaxy S6 (SM-G920F) would come in Blue, Gold, White and Black colors, which are available in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB capacities. For the more upmarket Galaxy S6 Edge, the list is similar but there’s an extra green colour option. That’s probably would be its exclusive colour, similar to Sony Xperia’s iconic purple edition.  With the increase of storage, do expect price hike from the RM2,399 tag of the  Galaxy S5 . Similarly, the Galaxy Note 4 was  priced at RM2,499  in Malaysia, which is RM100 more than the previous models. [  SOURCE   2 ,  VIA  ]"

Sure it’s no frills and don’t expect to run full graphics 3D-rendered games on it but for 90% of the people who just want a machine, to check Facebook, watch movies and do some office work on, you’re not going to need an i7, 512GB SSD, dedicated graphics powerhouse, what you might want to get is this, a sub-RM700 Intel Atom-based Windows 8.1 tablet from homegrown brand, iPro. The iPro LIVEPAD 8.9 offers an 8.9-inch display tablet running Intel’s Atom Z3735F Quad Core processor. You also get 16GB of on board storage, a 1920×1200 screen, an 8,000mAh battery and 2GB of RAM. At the rear, you get a 5MP AF camera and a 2MP rear camera. If you’re the first 800 people to buy the iPro LIVEPAD 8.9 from today until March 1, 2015, you can get the device for RM699 at Plaza Low Yat. If you’re the first 500 buyers, iPro will also throw in a free keyboard and pouch worth RM199 with each unit purchased. If that’s not enough, every iPro LIVEPAD comes with a free one-year subscription of Office 365 Personal that includes Power Point, Word, Excel, OneNote plus a massive 1TB of OneDrive storage. One major drawback for the iPro LIVEPAD is that it doesn’t seem to have a microSD expansion, so you’re going to run out of storage really quickly and will be depending on cloud storage or an external hard disk fairly regularly.     Once the promo ends, the iPro LIVEPAD will retail for RM799 and that puts it directly in competition with the other cheap Windows 8 computer, the  ASUS EeeBook X205 . The EeeBook X205 forgoes the tablet form-factor and touch screen but offers up a laptop with an 11.6-inch HD display (1366×768). You also get an Intel Atom Quad-Core 1.33GHz Z3735 Processor (Bay Trail-T) with 2GB of RAM, an option of 32GB or 64GB of on board storage and a microSD card slot  which gives the ASUS an advantage over the iPro .

Efficiency is the main feature of the Carrizo chips, with the new core architecture named Excavator being 5 percent faster than it’s predecessor the Kaveri, but it purportedly takes 40% less juice at the same clock rate, with even the graphical core supposedly using 20 % less power. The chip is also the first processor to meet the completed  Heterogeneous System Architecture  spec, which essentially lets the CPU and intergrated graphics share memory. This allows some tasks to finish faster than they normally would and is likely to give performance and battery life a much needed boost. The Carrizo chips will also feature dedicated H.265 video decoding which will aid in video streaming. Overall the new processor looks quite promising, and Carrizo is expected to hit PCs by the second quarter of this year; close to  Intel’s  mid-year target for it’s quad-core  Broadwell  chips. If we’re lucky we’ll have both Intel and AMD chips hitting the market simultaneously. [ SOURCE ][ VIA ]"

A set of new photos had emerged which claims to be Samsung’s latest flagship that  claims  to be taken from partner telco AT&T. This is the standard version which is expected to be launched alongside an “ Edge ” version that has been  teased  excessively for having a curved screen. If these images are true, the Galaxy S6 does come with a refreshing new design which departs from the typical Samsung Galaxy models of old. Following the footsteps of the Galaxy A series, the Galaxy S6 will be having a unibody metal frame design, which means there’s no removable back covers to tinker with. Both front and back are said to be covered with glass and the metal frame has a smooth rounded edge which reminds of the current  Sony Xperia Z3  along with a little hint of the  iPhone 6 . The top is very clean with a small centre mounted infrablaster and a secondary microphone. Meanwhile t the bottom, you’ll find micro USB port (which still uses micro USB 2.0), a loud speaker grill, mic and a headphone jack. With the exposed micro USB, the new flagship doesn’t seem to have water/dust resistance like its current  Galaxy S5  but this also means it’s easy to charge without having the annoying flap cover. The power/wake button is located on the right side along with a sim tray slot, while the volume rockers are individually placed on the left. Over at the back, the camera is protruding and next to it is a vertically mounted heart rate sensor. It is speculated that Samsung will  retain  the same  16MP camera  from the Galaxy Note 4 but they would be throwing in a couple software upgrades to make it a stellar performer in  low light conditions . UPDATE : The source has  provided  more photos and extra details of the device. The Galaxy S6 is said to be running on Android 5.0.2 and the home button’s integrated fingerprint scanner is much improved with a one touch feature like the iPhone’s TouchID. He added that the Galaxy S6 feels solid and the photos doesn’t do justice to the actual device.  We are currently in Barcelona to give you the latest coverage of  MWC 2015 . Stay tuned for the latest updates on  Facebook  and  Twitter  as we will be covering the major launches live.  Is Samsung finally bringing its new flagship to the right direction?

It certainly doesn’t look like it has a ‘ three edged screen ‘ as previously teased, but while it looks very similar to the  Note Edge  though it doesn’t appear to have the edges working separately from the main screen like the Galaxy Note Edge but looks like a less angular wrap-around screen. It might be possible for the display to work separately when needed like if the device were to be in locked mode but for now we can only be certain that it will be showing the same content as the main display. Still, with MWC just around the corner this may or may not be exactly what the actual final phone might be like, except that they probably will be sharing the same design aesthetic with existing Samsung Galaxy devices.

Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Google’s Chrome Browser are on the top of the list in terms of hogging storage; but it’s previous number 1 spot holder the NY Times app seems to have interestingly skipped the list all together this time. Facebook, Spotify and Instagram are also top three worst apps if you want to keep your devices running smoothly, all of which were in the top 5 last quarter.

Under the hood, the Moto E 2015 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and 4G LTE networking, which is similar to that being used by the  Samsung Galaxy A series  and the  Xiaomi Redmi 2,  with 4G LTE as a standard.  It also has a 5 megapixel rear camera with autofocus, VGA front facing camera, 1GB RAM mated to 8GB storage extendable via microSD, an 4.5-inch 540 x 960 pixel display as well as Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box.   They’ve also added it’s Quick Capture feature that lets you access the camera with a twist of your wrist as well as an Active Display feature that wakes up the screen with notifications or when you retrieve it from your pocket. This generally makes it a little better than the 2nd gen Moto G, which only has the advantage of a slightly larger rear camera sensor and display compared to the new Moto E.  There will also be a slightly cheaper, 3G variant of the new Moto E that sports a Snapdragon 200 processor. In terms of design, the smartphone pretty much looks the same as it’s predecessor. The Moto E will also get the same colourful swappable back covers with the new edition featuring the ability to swap in one of Motorola’s “grip shells”or coloured bands with six colour options. The original Moto E was one of the best entry-level budget smartphones and the Moto E 2015 is looking pretty appealing.

Ahead of  MWC 2015 , they have just announced an upgraded version that comes with 4G LTE connectivity. At first glance, it looks like a direct competitor to the  Samsung Gear S  and it even supports high quality VoLTE calls (Voice over LTE). To last longer on your wrist, the Urbane LTE comes with a 700mAh capacity unit (Standard Urbane: 410mAh), which is the largest for a smart watch but LG didn’t mention any battery life ratings. On top of that, LG has also included NFC which allows mobile payment without the need of taking out your smart phone from your pocket.   Design wise, it looks like a  standard Urbane  but it gets additional 2 buttons which  is shown above. Like the original, it is water resistant with IP67, which is good enough to submerge up to 1 metre depth for 30 minutes. The Urbane 4G LTE will be running on their own proprietary LG wearable OS and it will be compatible with all Android smart phones running version 4.4 and above.  Hopefully we can get a hands-on with the new watch at the LG booth next week. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

However this announcement does’t confirm if the G Flex 2 will be available in Malaysia. And judging by the  shaky position  that LG Mobile is in in Malaysia, we’re not entirely sure if the device will be coming to Malaysia at all. So if you’re planning to get the LG G Flex 2, your best bet right now is to get it from Singapore or from local grey importers but get ready to pay a  hefty premium  if you’re going with grey importers.   The G Flex 2 features an unique 5.5-inch Full HD (1080×1920)flexible Plastic-OLED display that delivers a pixel density of 401 ppi. The display also offers enhanced durability thanks to its plastic construction and flexible properties.

You get an option of 16GB or 32GB of on board storage and the microSC card slot support cards up to 2TB in size! If you’re wondering, the G Flex 2 runs Android Lollipop 5.0 While the curved plastic screen of the G Flex 2 is cool, the real awesome thing about the phone is its self-healing back cover that now heals scratches faster than the original G Flex. Speaking of fast, the G Flex2 features, LG’s fast charging technology that’s able to charge the device’s 3,000mAh non-replaceable battery from zero to 50% capacity in just a little over 30 minutes. In the camera department, you get a 13MP rear camera with OIS+ and LG’s unique Laser Auto Focus. At the front, you get a 2,1MP camera. Selfie junkies will be happy to know that the G Flex 2 offers an upgraded Gesture Shot feature that makes it easier to take selfies with just a hand gesture. LG has extended the distance from which the camera can recognize your hand to 1.5 meters, allowing you to use the feature with a selfie stick. So what do you think? Should LG bring the G Flex 2 to Malaysia? More importantly, if they did, would you buy it?"

The account will also come with Office Online and 1TB of OneDrive storage, which is icing on the cake.

To recap, these are the ‘rumours’ we know of so far; Recently we got a taste of what the new Galaxy smartphone could possibly look like with this recent render of the smartphone with an  almost edge-to-edge screen , though this could also be a Galaxy S6 Edge variant. Dual front-facing stereo speakers and a  16 megapixel camera , of which the camera we are more or less positive will be on the new phone but not so much the speakers. That the Galaxy S6 is likely to have a  powerful Exynos processor , blistering fast performance and a newer, more lightweight TouchWiz UI. A metal body, of which we are already certain that the smartphone will indeed be  sporting a metal frame  which is supposedly inspired by it’s beautiful surroundings. And now they are hinting at an even bigger screen. We don’t know for certain how big it’s going to be, but it’s safe to assume it’s could be around the 5.3 inch mark or perhaps even larger if this ‘rumour’ is to be believed, though it might be a  Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display .

The processor is an octa-core clocking in at 1.9GHz.

Granted the claim does sound pretty over the top but similar stunts have been pulled by Nokia before; if you remember the Nokia 808 Pureview and the  Lumia 1020. Similar to the  Meizu MX4 , the phone is expected to be using a MediaTek processor though we don’t yet know which one, but given that the Meizu MX4 featured a octa-core MT6596, it’s also possible that it could have something similarly powerful under the hood. MediaTek released a newer chip, the MT6795 late last year and it would make sense for Meizu to put this in their new smartphone as it’s a 64-bit octa-core as well as has PowerVR G6200 graphics clocking at 700MHz under the hood. The Meizu MX5 also looks like it will have a 5.5-inch screen in “2K resolution” as well as rumours pointing towards 4GB of RAM on top of the crazy camera. Time will tell if the rumours are true or whether or not Meizu has some interesting new tricks up it’s sleeves. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"
soyacincau,HTC One M9 appears again in alleged press images,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/23/htc-one-m9-appears-again-in-alleged-press-images/,"Android,HTC,HTC Hima,HTC One,HTC One M9,HTC One M9 Hima,HTC One M9 Launch,HTC One M9 leak,HTC One M9 Photos,MWC 2015,smart phone","Android,HTC,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS",2015-02-23,"HTC will be  going head on  with  Samsung  this coming Sunday as they will reveal its new One flagship smart phone. With less than a week left, any leaks on the  One M9  should be pretty close to the final product.  Now the folks from  MobileGeeks  apparently has gotten hold of what claims to be the official press images of the HTC One M9. It resembles very closely to the  initial leaked photos  that looked similar to the existing One M8.  The One M9 is shown with a similar HTC One M8 front but the back gets a slight revision with a squarish camera module that protrudes slightly from its all metal body. Also noticeable is the volume rocker and power button that’s now located on the right for better reach with a single hand. In terms of colours, we get to see 2 options – Gunmetal Grey and a Silver version with golden frames. For the coming launch, HTC apparently will be using the tagline: “You only have one life. Show off your style. #onelife” When the first leaks appeared, some sources denied the strong resemblance to the existing One. Instead it was suggested that it would come with a  different design  which includes a redesigned speaker grill and a centre mounted front facing Ultrapixel camera. Either HTC is trying to play safe or we are still seeing yet another decoy which is quite unlikely right now. Spec-wise, the new One M9 is said to retain its 5.0″ Full HD display but runs on a more powerful 2.0GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM. The on-board storage seems to be doubled up to 32GB, which is also expandable via microSD up to 128GB capacity. For imaging, HTC will be swapping its 4MP effective Ultrapixel camera to the front while the main photography works is to be handled by a larger 20MP sensor.  In terms of overall dimensions, the One M9 is said to be slightly thicker at 9.61mm  (HTC One M8: 9.4mm) and that’s probably due to a much larger battery capacity of 2,900mAh (HTC One M8: 2,600mAh). Interestingly, they managed to reduced the weight slightly from 160g on the One M8 down to 157.5 grams on the new model. Out of the box, the new One M9 would run on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop with the latest Sense 7.0 UI layered on top. We’ll be heading to Barcelona to cover the HTC event live, so do catch us on  Facebook  and  Twitter  for the latest updates. Is this the real One? We are left with just 6 days until it is officially revealed. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Measuring in at 5.4mm thin, it’s a whole lot skinnier than the iPad Air 2’s 6.1mm and the Venue 8 7000’s 6.0mm. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 2 will come in 8 inch and 9.7 inch models with the model numbers SM-T710 and SM-T810 respectively. There isn’t significant difference between the  original Tab S  and Tab S 2 tablets with the most noticeable improvement being the switch to a 4:3 aspect ratio for the Super AMOLED displays, which is a drop from 2560 x 1600 pixels resolution on it’s predecessor in favour of 2048 x 1536 resolution. This shouldn’t make too much difference as the resolution will still be quite high, especially on the 8 inch model.

The same design had appeared in an  earlier leak , which more or less confirms the existence of the device. Could it be just another decoy to keep things under wraps until the big day? Maybe.   It was speculated that HTC will be designing its next  flagship differently , with a centre positioned front facing camera and a new speaker grill design which is similar to its recently announced  Desire EYE . Even serial leakster @evleaks had  tweeted  a series of HTC One images with the purported new design that’s different. Based on these new inputs,  Phone Designer  had reconstructed a HTC One M9 render to give everyone a better visual of what to expect. We must say, the render looks pretty impressive and it does look like a progression over the current  HTC One M8 . The biggest change of course is the front of the device, with a cleaner look with the screen dominating more space of the front. This is made possible with a smaller speaker grill that’s placed closer to the edge, similar to the  Sony Xperia Z2 . The front camera that’s likely to be its Ultra-Pixel unit has been relocated right smack in the middle for a more symmetrical appearance. The rest of the device such as the back and sides are left unchanged from what  we’ve seen so far , with the power button now moved from the top to the sides.  We certainly hope that HTC will surprise us with a refresher design and probably alongside with  a bigger model .

HTC initially didn’t officially mention what their event would be focusing on when the brand sent out their invites but based on all the  rumours and speculation  it’s a no brainer that HTC was going to reveal another HTC One smartphone. And now we have this teaser from HTC UK. To recap all the information that we know of the new HTC One M9, is that it will have a similar all aluminium unibody, an updated boomsound speak grill as well as camera and it will have a radically different design from it’s predecessor the M8. However there has been some discrepancy between leaks so it’s quite likely that dummy decoys might have been released to thwart early leaks. Spec-wise, the HTC One M9 is rumoured to run on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM while the front display retains the similar 5″ screen with Full HD resolution. It will be juiced up with a slightly bigger 2,840mAh capacity battery and for imaging it will get a 20.7MP shooter at the back while selfies are taken with an Ultrapixel camera (presumably 4MP effective with 2.0 micron pixel size). Out of the box, you can count on them to be running on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop with a newer Sense 7.0 interface. There’s also rumours that HTC is planning to reveal a  wearable  as well, so there might be a chance we might get to see it at MWC this year. [ SOURCE ,  VIA ]"

The current Butterfly 2 was  announced in August  (aka  J Butterfly  in Japan) and it went  on sale in Malaysia  the following month.

It has sold over  a million units , even in the face of more capable competition like  Android Wear . With Google’s open approach for their smart wearable platform, Pebble has successfully integrated Android Wear notification and interaction with their latest software update that’s out of  Beta . The biggest change is the way it handles incoming messages which you now can reply straightaway from your wrist. You can do so with preset messages or alternatively with an emoji. If the message is urgent, you can trigger it to open on your smart phone directly from your Pebble. This works with the latest Pebble 2.3 Android App with the Pebble Watch’s v2.9 firmware.  For the notification response, you’ll be given 5 slots to enter your preset messages, and this is easily accessed when an incoming message is shown. For iOS users, you can dismiss notifications from your watch but it lacks the interaction portion that comes with Android. If you haven’t updated your Pebble Android app yet, you can do so over  here . This time, the latest version will work on older Android versions with at least Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0+).

The next ZenWatch is said to be able to  last up to 7 days  on a single charge. How is this even possible considering most Android Wear devices last just a couple of days on a single charge? The answer lies on the operating system and ASUS is reported to be turning to a different OS to achieve this. It’s Chairman Jonney Shih has hinted the usage of a simplified chipset and a different OS for longer endurance. This doesn’t mean ASUS is abandoning Android Wear altogether as they would still release a variant with Google’s wearable platform.  Apart from introducing a new watch, ASUS also intends to release a couple more wearables targeted at lower price segments. This includes one with health management features that can track and monitor footsteps, heartbeat, pulse and even blood sugar levels. The first ZenWatch was introduced during IFA 2014 in September and the next version is likely to be released around the same time in Q3 2015. For last year alone, over  700,000 Android Wear  devices have been shipped which is not too shabby considering that most of them are released in limited countries towards the 2nd half of the year. The biggest question is whether these Android Wear players would be able to stand up to the challenge once Apple’s  new Watch  starts shipping in April. Battery life has always been a pet peeve for smart wearables and this is where the  Pebble  shines for having a week long usage, with the usage of a non-touch monochrome screen. According to  early reports , the new Apple Watch would also suffer a short battery life as they put more emphasis on a high-definition and fluid user experience. If charging a smart watch turns you off, the Swiss might have something for you as  Swatch  is working on a smart watch that doesn’t require charging at all.  Would you mind sacrificing function for longer battery life? Share your thoughts below. [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

As it turns out, Qualcomm’s top of the line processor might just be throttling it’s performance just to stay frosty, which might be very well the reason why  Samsung decided to drop it  it’s home-brewed Exynos chips. Qualcomm is indeed trying to shed it’s overheating perceptions but Samsung has probably made the right choice. However, as explored by  GeekTech , it doesn’t look to be all it seems as benchmarking test seem to say that we aren’t getting the whole picture. Granted that they did release that their devices would have a skin temperature limit of 45°C and that it is indeed cooler than their last device, but their  reference device  looks like it might be misleading the scores as it’s much thicker and probably has better cooling than your average smartphone.  AnandTech  didn’t find any issues with the SD 810 either, so it’s a little puzzling, because their tests did show a good 33% boost over the SD 805 and  GFXBench  results tell us that there was only about 10% performance increase as opposed to the 30% claimed by Qualcomm. David from  AndroidPolice  also ranted about a device that he can’t mention (likely to be a  LG G Flex 2 ) with benchmark scores that deteriorate greatly after each iteration of testing. This indicates that the processor is capping it’s full potential as it starts to heat up. It’s akin to putting a leash on a horse in the middle of a race and that really doesn’t bode well for Qualcomm. Thanks to  Fish  for the heads up!"

With the  Galaxy S6  smart phone making its debut very soon, Samsung is about to release the successor of its flagship  Galaxy Tab S  tablet. At 6.6mm, the Tab S is quite a remarkably thin device but it still thicker than other competitors like the  Xperia Z2 Tablet  (6.4mm) and Apple’s  iPad Air 2  (6.1mm). For the next model which is dubbed as the Galaxy Tab S2, it is reported to be thinner than Apple’s wafer thin iPad.    Will Samsung hold the record of having the slimmest tablet? It all depends on its final dimensions. The tablet to beat is the  Dell Venue 8 7000  that’s only 6.0mm thick and it comes with an 8.4″ 2560×1600 display that’s interestingly the same as the Galaxy Tab S 8.4″.  In terms of specs, the Galaxy tablet will also come in 2 sizes – 8.0″ and 9.7″. If you’re wondering why the change from its current 8.4″ and 10.5″ sizes, Samsung apparently is making the move to having a 4:3 display aspect ratio. Typical an Android tablet has a more rectangular 16:9 aspect ratio which makes it perfect for watching video content, as opposed to Apple iPad’s 4:3 aspect ratio designed for reading and web browsing. Several Android tablets including the  Nokia N1 ,  Nexus 9  and Xiaomi’s  Mi Pad  have already made the switch to a more squarish 4:3 aspect ratio display.

That’s probably the case of most brands except for Samsung, which recently has  dropped it  in favour for its in-house developed Exynos processors. Samsung has alleged that the latest Snapdragon is having heat issues which Qualcomm has denied. To refute its claims, Qualcomm has released a comparison test of a Snapdragon 801 powered device versus another smart phone that runs on the latest Snapdragon 810 processor. No doubt that the new processor is much more powerful but can it take the heat compared to last year’s flagships? To compare its thermal efficiency, Qualcomm is measuring the “skin temperature”, which is taken off the surface of the device. The comparison is conducted in a room temperature of about 25°C. According to them, most smart phones would have a skin temperature limit of 45°C, which upon hitting would automatically slow down its processor performance to avoid further overheating.  In the first test, they ran Asphalt 8 game on both devices. After 20 minutes, the Snapdragon 801 unit has already reached its 45°C ceiling, while the Snapdragon 810 device is still going strong, hovering around the 40°C even after 30 minutes of running. This translate to cooler performance and there’s extra headroom in between its max temperature threshold. Recording 4K videos are intensive as well and most flagship models would normally impose a 5 minute limit before a temperature warning pops up. True enough, the Snapdragon 801 device fires up quickly to 45°C after 5 minutes but surprisingly the newer Snapdragon 810 still soldiers on around a cool 35°C over the same duration. They didn’t show what happens beyond that but overall it is enough to show that the newer processor is much cooler than what you’ll get from 2014 flagship models. So far these are just 2 comparisons within the Snapdragon family and we are more interested if they could  compare  it against other rival processors. At the moment, the Snapdragon 810 processor has been announced for the  LG G Flex 2  and Xiaomi’s  Mi Note Pro , and they expect other players such as OPPO, Sony, HTC, Motorola and Microsoft to join the list of Snapdragon 810 supported devices.

Side by side, the clone unit is noticably thicker and the back is made out of cheap plastic instead of a more expensive 3D gorilla glass. The biggest difference is in the performance where it scores a lower 18,000 points instead of 46,600 points on Antutu.

Granted the OnePlus team is still inexperienced, they felt the need to apologize for a variety of mistakes they made with a promise of doing better. It’s great that they’re still so invested in the Malaysian market (and community) as a whole, and despite the initial setbacks in regards to being ‘ so eager to get you the phone that we lost track of what matters the most – our users ‘ .  However they were in KL recently to make deals with potential partners and sort out issues in regards to their supply chain so it certainly looks like they are going to make good on their promises, with a prospective launch date the moment they get one.

The teaser looks like it’s hinting at an upcoming smartwatch which is no surprise either since the company has listed a  smartwatch as a new device  to be launched this year, plus the  Huawei Talkband B1  was launched at MWC 2014 and is in serious need of an upgrade. The Talkband B1 was mostly just a Bluetooth headset that docked on your wrist, with some extra fitness capabilities slapped on for good measure. Huawei’s mysterious smartwatch will likely have 4G LTE connectivity and will be a rival for the  Samsung Gear S,  which is saying a lot considering how ‘basic’ their previous smartwatch was, meaning they’ve probably upped their game in terms of tech as well.

Sirap Bandung,The Chinese and Taiwanese brands are taking over the smart phone scene in 2015,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/16/the-chinese-and-taiwanese-brands-are-taking-over-the-smart-phone-scene-in-2015/,"2015,Asus,budget smartphones,China,Honor,huawei,IDC,industry,Malaysia Smart Phone Sales,Oppo,smart phone,smartphone,taiwan,Taiwan smartphones,Xiaomi",Industry in General,2015-02-16,"According to a report by IDC, an industry analyst company, big-time smartphone vendors like  Apple  and  Samsung  are going to find it more difficult to compete in the premium smartphone segment this year due to the sea of  Chinese and Taiwanese  vendors with offerings of cheaper and just as capable smartphones. According to Daniel Pang, Asean senior research manager of the client devices and mobility division of IDC Market Research (M) Sdn Bhd, while many Malaysians would still prefer owning a premium flagship smartphone, the economical pinch are causing many consumers to feel that they just aren’t getting enough out of their investment.’ IDC’s Asia Pacific Mobile Phone Tracker shows that Chinese and Taiwanese vendors held a whopping 46% market share of the Malaysian smartphone market in the first three quarters of 2014 as opposed to 19% in the entirety of 2013, and we believe that the percentage will continue to rise as the year progresses. The main reason this is happening is that over the last two years Chinese and Taiwanese vendors have been steadily producing high specification smartphones at a fraction of the cost for similar phones being sold by bigger companies. An example of this would be the  Huawei Honor 6  which are sold for RM 999 which is nearly half the price of similarly specced devices. However, a price war of this scale on the budget tier of smartphones is unlikely as the profit margin in that segment is already very low. But this still puts large vendors like HTC, Sony and even Apple a bit of a twist as brands like  Xiaomi  and  OnePlus  continue to grow with their unique selling practices and clever marketing techniques. Maybe it’s time for the big boys to learn some tricks from the little guys? Granted the Chinese brands are getting better in terms of hardware but they still aren’t on par with the big brands in terms of the software experience, either due to issues with their OS or unimaginative UI that’s more a hindrance than a help. For those who can spring the cash, they will still continue to support the mainstream brands mainly on part of general reliability, familiarity as well as more steady software updates. Nothing the brands can’t fix if they decide to pump more resources into make their software better instead of just reskinning the latest version of  Android . [ SOURCE  ,  VIA ]"

Well known to be full of bloatware, generally unoptimized and not very visually appealing, the new version with the Galaxy S6 is rumoured to be optimized to the point it will run similar to near-stock Android level and will majorly cut down on the bloatware by making most of it optional downloads. This is a great move on their part so users will be able to get more performance out of it instead of just relying on devices with larger and larger amounts of processing power to handle it all. However it is unclear just what sort of apps Samsung has removed, where it could be possible that things like S Health, S Voice, S Note or Scrapbook will have to be downloaded separately on the Galaxy Apps store. However, the Galaxy S6 will instead come inbuilt with apps like Microsoft OneNote, OneDrive, Office Mobile with a free Office 365 subscription and Skype, signalling a shift in  Microsoft’s focus  in the smartphone market considering the  Windows Phone  isn’t doing as well as it should. As performance goes, the TouchWiz on the Galaxy S6 is purported to be  extremely fast  compared to Android Lollipop on the Galaxy Note 4, and they have also adopted a lot of the animations and effects that debuted on Lollipop so we can safely assume that it will look better too. Other changes will be made to the UI as well, inclusive of more theming options, 4x, 4×5 and 5×5 icon layouts for the app drawer, an updated default keyboard, app drawer tweaks and a ‘green as grass’ dialer app. The changes can only be good for the end-users with the much needed update; so lets hope these changes really are for the better when we get to see it during  Samsung’s UNPACKED event during MWC 2015 .

Now, Samsung has tested it out using the  GeekBench  benchmarking tool and unsurprisingly the device is showing the same blistering fast performance. According to GeekBench the Galaxy S6 Edge which has a Exynos 7420 processor under the hood, scored a good 1,492 point in the single-core test and 5,077 in the mulit-core test. That even beats the  iPad Air 2 ‘s triple core and 2GB setup, as well as being more powerful than the  Samsung Galaxy Note 4  which scored a maximum of 1,054 and 3,374 points in the single and multi-core tests. Qualcomm could very well be in trouble since Samsung’s Exynos chip is leaving the Snapdragon 810 in the dust. From what we know about the phone so far is that the display is shown to be a 5.1″ (likely Super AMOLED) with a Quad HD resolution of 2560×1440. Strangely there’s no extra display width like the current  Galaxy Note Edge  that does 2560×1600. For imaging, it gets a 20MP main shooter and a front facing 5MP camera for selfies. As you would expect for a 2015 flagship, it runs on the newer Android 5.0.2 Lollipop out of the box. There’s also rumours that Samsung might streamline it’s  TouchWiz  interface for it’s next flagship.. The  design  for the Galaxy S6 and Edge is still up to debate, but all will be known come MWC 2015 in Barcelona. [ SOURCE ,   VIA ]"

Google  is giving out a free and permanant 2GB bump to your max storage in return for doing a  Security Checkup  for your Drive. This is in regards to Safer Internet Day and you’ll only get the extra storage if you complete the checkup by the 17th of February. If you’ve been repeatedly maxing out your cloud storage, we recommend you grab it while you can. While Drive files are already encrypted and protected, the goal of this is to ensure that you’re making the most out of it. In a nutshell what the checkup does is it lets you review recent sign-in activity, confirms the apps and devices that access account information as well as ensures your account recovery information is current in the event of a hacking or illegal access. After a successful checkup, you will see three green checkboxes that confirm your eligibility for the additional storage and have undertaken the steps for  better online security . Users who have done the check will be granted the storage around the 28th of February, but users who are using Google Apps for Work and Google Apps for Education aren’t eligible for the extra storage but are still encouraged by Google to do the check anyway.

In a recent leak, we see a leak on the  Gionee  Elife S7 showcasing a surprisingly thin smartphone that’s apparently 4.6mm thick. Gionee got into the fray with the  Elife S5.1  which was just 5.15mm, where it was quickly overtaken by the  Oppo R5  which measured in at 4.85mm, and then the  Vivo X5 Max  which was 4.8mm and most recently the  Ivvi K1 Mini  at 4.7mm. Images after the break The leaked pictures from China show that it does look incredibly thin, and rumour has it that the S7 might just be a placeholder name considering it doesn’t fit into the company’s naming convention for their phones where the number dictates the thickness of the device. Gionee has already sent out invites for its MWC 2015 launch in March but we have no idea if it will be showcased there and whether or not it will actually be as skinny as they claim.

If the top of the line iPhone is considered too mainstream, here’s another luxury option for their consideration. The Hanmac New Defency is a luxury smart phone from France that’s designed for the affluent Chinese market. Similar to  Vertu , Hanmac prides itself with hand made craftsmanship and they claim to take about 30 days to make. The exterior appearance looks rather weird with an industrial design from the steam age. You can see a couple of design elements that replicate gears, trains and mechanical chains. For a premium feel, it uses high grade materials such as titanium, ceramic and the display is protected by scratch-resistant sapphire glass.  While it looks expensive on the exterior, the device is quite low grade on the inside. It gets a 3.5″ display that does a lowly 800×480 resolution and it runs on an entry-level 1.2GHz Quad-Core MediaTek 6589 prcessor with 2GB of RAM. Storage is quite generous with 64GB on-board and there’s also a 13MP main camera and a front facing 3MP shooter. Keeping the lights on is a rather small 1,440mAh capacity battery and it runs on a dated Android 4.2 Jelly bean.  For its starting price of 16,800 CNY (about RM9,574), this is quite a lot to pay for such specs and it could go up to 38,000 CNY (about RM21,600) with all the highest grade options included. This makes the Hanmac the most expensive MediaTek-powered device, which is usually associated with cost effective smart phones. If we have the money and are forced to pick a luxury device, the  Vertu Aster  looks more aesthetically pleasing and has better specs that’s acceptable for today’s standards.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

Initially speculated for  MWC 2015 release , Sony interestingly has decided to announce it weeks ahead of the international mobile event.  At first glance, the Xperia E4 looks the replacement of the  Xperia E3  and overall it still retains Sony’s Omni-Balance design throughout. The front display is upsized from the 4.5″ FWVGA (854×480) display on the Xperia E3 to a better 5.0″ qHD (960×540) screen.  However under the hood, Sony opts for a more cost effective Quad-Core 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6582 processor, that’s similar to the one that’s powering the  Honor 3C  and  Honor 3C Lite . It is mated to 1GB of RAM and has 8GB of on-board storage that can expand further to another 32GB with microSD. For taking pictures, selfie lovers would be happy to know that they have upgraded the VGA shooter on the E3 to a much decent 2MP front camera, and it even comes with its own dedicated selfie app. The main camera at the back is still a similar 5MP unit that supports Full HD 1080p video recording. Connectivity wise, the Xperia E4 only supports 3G HSPA+, which is a notch below the Xperia E3 that supports 4G LTE. A dual-sim Xperia E4 Dual variant is also available as well. Powering the Xperia E4 is a similar capacity 2,300mAh battery and Sony claims that it could last up to 2 days on a single charge, just like its current Xperia Z3 line up. While the press release mentions that it runs on Android 4.4.4, the  Xperia E4  product page is listing its operating system as Android 5.0 Lollipop.

While the current  Exynos 5433  (from the Note 4) and  Snapdragon 810  processors are based on a 20nm fabrication process, the newer 64-bit Exynos 7420 Octa-Core  processor is based on a much finer 14nm manufacturing process, which should lead to greater performance and power efficiency.

The biggest area of improvement is its 3D performance, where it sets a huge gap with its ARM Mali-T760 GPU.

WeChat users who are not Digi subscribers can also connect with the operator via the application. To connect with Digi via WeChat, look for “DIGI_MY”. In its announcement, Digi and WeChat were not clear as to operating hours of the service, so we can’t say if Digi_MY on WeChat is available 24/7.  In any case, if you’re a Digi Weekly or Monthly Prepaid Mobile Internet data subscriber, you can use WeChat to connect with Digi without using up the quota from your subscribed data plan.  “We are thrilled to be in this partnership with WeChat,” said Praveen Rajan Nadarajan, Digi’s Head of Digital Services. “Digi is the first telco in Malaysia to work with WeChat in providing convenience and easy access to users through the popular social communications app. This, again, shows our commitment to bringing innovation to our customers and the industry,” Praveen added. “Our reason for choosing to work with WeChat was simple: WeChat is more than just a messaging app. It has social elements and other functionality which allows us to reach out to a wide audience.

Sirap Bandung,Corning’s cooking up a new scratch-resistant glass,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/09/cornings-cooking-up-a-new-scratch-resistant-glass/,"apple,Corning,Corning Gorilla Glass,glass screen,Gorilla Glass,project phire,Samsung,scratch resistant,smartphone","Mobile Devices,Rumour Mill,Uncategorized",2015-02-09,"In November last year, Corning announced their  Gorilla Glass 4 , which is about twice as tough as it’s predecessor Gorilla Glass 3. The new material can be made 25% thinner but they have made a lot less headway in making it scratch proof. Many smartphones, inclusive of Apple’s iPhones and Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones already features  Gorilla Glass  as a standard feature, and the company is making a brand new Gorilla Glass-like composite material that has the toughness of their signature glass but with a scratch resistance close to that of Sapphire. Sapphire is a great material as it it’s very scratch resistant but it’s unfortunately more prone to shattering when taking fall damage. The project is dubbed Project Phire and was announced last week at a New York investor meeting by Corning executive James Clappin, but was dropped with very few details. “We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn’t fare well when dropped,” Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told the crowd at the event. “So, we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire.” The company makes most of it’s revenue from making glass for TV displays and fiber-optics so their smartphone glass production has been good for their growth, with Gorilla Glass being standard issue for a vast majority of mobile devices due to it’s ability to take falls of up to 1 meter in height. Apple was rumoured to be featuring a  sapphire glass screen  for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus but decided to scratch that last minute because they couldn’t withstand drop tests. But the  Apple Watch  however will be featuring a sapphire screen, for some versions of the wearable. Project Phire might be what Corning needs to keep itself ahead of the game, and hopefully our devices from turning into modern art if we accidentally drop them. [ SOURCE ]"

Of the new information we’ve seen, it looks like the front and back of the phones will have the same colour, an all-metal rim (and construction) and possibly a glass design. It also seems that the Samsung Galaxy Edge’s double curved edges will be 30-50% less curved than that of the Galaxy Note Edge to leave just enough space for a side mounted volume rocker and power button and that the curves on both sides will be uniform.

If you answer yes to this question then you could be wrong. And the stats seem to back this up. While some quarters would like nothing better to do than to scare the public with claims that radiation from mobile phone — particularly smartphones that’s packed with various radio antennas — the physics and the stats show that there is no correlation between mobile phone use and cancer. But don’t take our word for it. Check out this video from  Veritasium , one of the most prominent science educational channels on YouTube, that explains, in simple terms, why you shouldn’t worry too much about the radiation emanating from your smartphone and it does a really good job of debunking a lot of myths surrounding the topic Debunking the myth. 
 Can radiation from mobile phone cause cancer? 
Not directly because the radiation emanating by mobile phones are non-ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation doesn’t have enough energy to alter your DNA. Mobile phone radiation is identical to the ones you get in a microwave. If microwaves can cook food, microwaves from phones can cook my brain. 
Not really, while the type of waves are similar. The radiation generated by a microwave oven is over 1000 times stronger than the radiation coming from your phone. Living near a mobile phone tower is will increase the chances of you getting cancer. 
Not really. The truth is this, if you live in an area with better reception, that means your phone will have to emit less microwaves to get the same performance. So you’re actually exposed to lower radiation the closer you are to a cell tower. Cell towers do not create very intense microwave fields near your head. Phones result in much higher intensity radiation near your head because of their close proximity. A Swedish study has shown that you are 3 times more at risk of developing Glioma — the most common form of malignant brain cancer — and the World Health Organisation has classified cellphone radiation as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, so it must be dangerous! 
Consider that brain cancers are exceeding rare. In any given year, you have a 3-in-100,000 chance to develop Glioma. Taking the Swedish study into account, the likelihood of you developing due to long term mobile phone use (over 25 years) is 9-in-100,000, which is still a very, very small number. Also, some quarters are arguing that the study could be methodologically flawed. Meanwhile, a study in Denmark that involved the whole Danish population (over 5 million people) found no link between mobile phone usage and brain cancer. So what do you think?"
soyacincau,Don’t Bodoh: Be careful with U Mobile’s “free calls” claim on its new plan,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/07/dont-bodoh-be-careful-with-u-mobiles-free-calls-claim-on-its-new-plan/,"#GetClever,Don't Bodoh,free calls,Postpaid Plans,Prepaid Plans,U Mobile,U Mobile Get Clever,U Mobile P50,U Mobile P70,U Mobile Postpaid,U Mobile Prepaid,UMI 20,UMI 30,UMI 50","Players on the Field,U Mobile",2015-02-07,"A week ago, U Mobile had launched its new  #GetClever  prepaid and postplan plans that promise to give better value. It challenges its competitors with generous data quota, cheaper call rates and free 30 minutes of calls everyday within U Mobile’s network. For 2015, U Mobile says that they want to give customers the best value, be a challenger telco and most importantly be transparent to its customers. It was  brought to our attention , that the free calls offer isn’t as clear cut as it seems. If you’re going to make a lot of calls, there’s something you should know before signing up. Let’s take a look at one of their plans, like this one, the P70 Postpaid which offers 4.5GB of internet with 70 minutes of calls per month and FREE 30 minutes of calls per day within U Mobile network. On the surface, it looks like you have 70 minutes to call non-U Mobile numbers (Maxis, DiGi, Celcom, TuneTalk, local fixed lines) and pay absolutely nothing for calls within U Mobile, provided if you don’t use more than 30 minutes per day.  Need more clarification? Let’s look at the  FAQ  and  T&C .  Under the FAQ: If you’re still unconvinced, even the P50 and P70 postpaid schedule table from the T&C clearly separates the Free 30 mins/day for ON-NET (within U Mobile) and the respective 50 or 70 mins/month specifically for OFF-NET (to non-U Mobile numbers) use. However it appears that  several people  (us included) were caught unaware on how U Mobile’s free calls actually works. Despite the clarity in the FAQ and the clear differentiation between on-net and off-net calls in the T&C, there’s a little catch on how the free calls within U Mobile are being utilised.  Apparently, the free calls to U Mobile numbers will be utilising your OFF-NET calls FIRST before the actual Free 30 minutes/day offer kicks in. So this means, if you’re on P70 and if you’ve made 10 minutes of calls to U Mobile numbers for 7 days straight (10 minutes x 7 = 70 minutes), you won’t have any OFF-NET quota left to call other numbers.  At first, we thought maybe this is just an internal billing issue so we’ve reached out to U Mobile for clarification and have received the following response: So there’s no such thing as an OFF-NET and ON-NET buckets. To make it simpler, there’s only 70 minutes of free calls to ALL numbers. The free 30 minutes of calls to U Mobile only kicks in only after you’ve finished up your monthly call quota. It is also the same story for  Prepaid  as well. Technically U Mobile is still right to say they are giving 30 minutes free voice calls within U Mobile but what we don’t like is how it utilises your Off Net calls, which you as the consumer could save up and potentially carry forward to the next month. If you intend to make lots of free calls, you can probably forget about its “carry forward up to 2X of your talktime to the following month” feature, as you probably could have finished them all on calls within U Mobile. Most Malaysians have a distrust of telcos especially when there’s a stigma of being scammed or overcharged for something they didn’t use. We expected much more from U Mobile especially with their promise to be more transparent with greater customer focus. If the ON-NET calls aren’t entirely FREE (not by utilising from another free bucket), U Mobile could have communicated this better upfront to avoid misleading its potential subscribers. We’ve made a call to U Mobile’s customer service at +6018 388 1318 and it appears that the reps are not really aware of such conditions.  If you’re a subscriber of these new #GetClever plans, tell us what you think? And whether if you’re made aware of such terms before signing up."

soyacincau,Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Review: Curved not just for looks,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/05/samsung-galaxy-note-edge-review-curved-not-just-for-looks/,"Android,Curved Display,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Note Edge,Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Malaysia,Samsung Galaxy Note Edge price,Samsung Galaxy Note Edge Review,samsung malaysia,SM-N915F,smart phone","Android,Mobile Devices,Mobile OS,Samsung",2015-02-05,"Curved displays: Is it just a fad or an innovation with substance? Back in 2013, both Samsung and LG have been playing around with flexible displays with the  Galaxy Round  and the  G Flex . These experimental devices are not really a big deal apart from having a quirky form factor that claims to offer better ergonomics. During CES 2013, Samsung had demonstrated its  YOUM prototype device  that comes with a sloping curved screen. When the  Galaxy Note 4  was announced, Samsung has taken this concept into production and the end result is the  Galaxy Note Edge .  Initially launched with  limited availability , the Galaxy Note Edge is finally here in Malaysia with the retail price of RM2,999. So is the Galaxy Note Edge worth the extra RM500 over the normal Galaxy Note 4? Read on to find out. Let’s go through the specs first. The Galaxy Note Edge is positioned as a more exclusive and premium model over the current Galaxy Note 4, so you can expect pretty much the same hardware underneath. At first glance, you’ll notice that the Galaxy Note Edge is slightly wider but it is overall shorter due to its slightly smaller display. It gets a 5.6″ screen instead of 5.7″ size that’s found on the Galaxy Note 4. The display is still using Super AMOLED which produces rich colours with great viewing angles but the Galaxy Note Edge does a slightly higher Quad HD resolution of 2560×1600, which is 160 pixels extra for the edge. As comparison, the Galaxy Note 4 like any other Quad HD/2K smart phones is pushing 2560×1440 resolution. Under the hood, the Galaxy Note Edge runs on a 2.7GHz Quad Core Snapdragon 805 processor. Meanwhile, the current Galaxy Note 4 for Malaysia is running on Samsung’s very own  Exynos 5433 Octa-Core processor  which appears to be better on benchmarks and battery life. We’ll talk about the performance a bit later. Despite being a more premium device, the Galaxy Note Edge surprisingly comes with a 3,000mAh capacity battery, that’s slightly smaller than the Note 4’s 3,220mAh unit.  The rest of the device is pretty much unchanged, with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage which is expandable with microSD, a 16MP main camera with OIS and a front facing 3.7MP shooter that supports wide selfie. At the front, the physical home button has a fingerprint scanner while the back comes with a UV/heart rate sensor which can be used to trigger selfie shots at a single tap. Being a Note category device, it also gets the latest S-Pen feature with enhanced sensitivity and a host of multi-tasking software features.  In most angles, the Galaxy Note Edge isn’t dramatically different from the Note 4 that it is based on. You get what appears to be an aluminium frame but the coating of it somehow feels like plastic. The rest of its ports and physical buttons are unchanged but upon closer inspection, the Galaxy Note Edge side profile appears to be more streamlined without the extra protruding bumps for its volume rocker button and corners. The major difference would be its power button which is now shifted to the top on the Galaxy Note Edge. For us, we don’t have much issues with this but those with smaller hands might struggle to switch off the device with a single hand. 
Over at the back, it features the same faux leather removable back cover that feels more upmarket with a rubber-like texture. Similar to the Note 4, the loud speaker is placed at the back, which isn’t our favourite placement but the audio playback is loud enough for most scenarios.  Internally, the Galaxy Note Edge is essentially the same as what you’ll get from the Galaxy Note 4 with a more current Android 4.4.4 KitKat and the latest TouchWiz UI. Some of our favourite features include its resizable pop-up windows and the ability to minimise and to split apps in multiview with a simple flick.  For fitness buffs, it gets the same S-Health features and measurement tools to track your steps, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation level and UV rays from the sun. Another feature which we find quite interesting is its multi-directional audio recording. This lets you record a boardroom meeting and you can selectively play or mute audio from each respective direction.  While some might dislike TouchWiz for being bloaty, but the new interface feels much more refined than the Samsung Galaxy devices of old. After all, it is their multi-window and S-Pen features that made the Note series more productive than your average large screen phablet.  Now lets go deeper with the curve screen and its advantages. The edge screen, which is what Samsung would like to call it, isn’t a separate piece and it is a continuous flow from its main display. By default, it functions as a shortcut toolbar which is capable of displaying up to 7 icons simultaneously. When the device is locked, the edge will display a decorate panel which can be customised to your preference with its built-in Express Me panel.  Each time there’s a notification, it will automatically display as a scrolling ticker, instead of traditional placement at the notification bar. At first it looks cool and it takes us a while to get used to reading a vertical scrolling text. To read the full details or message, you’ll have to quickly tap on the alert before it disappears.  Beyond the usual notification and shortcuts, you can add additional panels which are free to download. Some of the useful ones include a mobile data tracker, twitter trends, S-Health status bar and Yahoo News. For a little bit of fun, there are games for the edge panel like Tiny Burger and Memory Match. The edge screen is smart enough to change its display orientation depending on usage for example while lying flat on a table versus being held.  When the panel is active, you can pull up a couple of tricks by swiping from the top most portion. This brings down some tools like ruler which works in both cm and inches, a torch light, stop watch, timer and a sound recorder. To access the edge display settings, just swipe from the bottom end to reveal the settings icon. If you’re in a meeting, you can discreetly switch on the edge display only by simply swiping from left to right repeatedly. This will activate a night clock, which you can swipe vertically to bring up other panels. At night, the edge can also be used as a bedside clock and you can set what time of the day for it to be activated. Since this is a Super AMOLED display, each pixels are lighted individually which probably takes a minimal toll on its battery life. Before this, we had our perception that the edge display can intrusive while using normal apps. However Samsung has made it smart enough to minimise itself when the edge isn’t in use. The edge panel only appears when you’re in the home screen or if you trigger the panel by swiping it outwards. By default, the edge display on the right makes it more practical for right handed users. If you’re left handed, you’ll be happy to know there’s the option to rotate the screen 180 degrees, which brings the edge experience to the left. Then again, this would look pretty awkward as you’ll need to rotate back to the other end when making a call and if you need to access the home and back buttons. For the edge to be truly useful, it needs supported apps to make use of its extra 160 pixels. With the S-Pen being its vital tool, the S-Note app has been redesigned slightly to display its pen tools and settings on the edge, instead of floating at the top. Meanwhile for video playback, the native player has its timeline and playback controls moved towards the edge for an unobstructed view.  We particularly liked the way it handle phone calls when the Note Edge is in use. Instead of a floating pop-up, the incoming call alert appears on the edge display and you can choose to answer or reject by swiping the icons up or down. This is useful while driving as you don’t want any incoming calls to block your waze navigation.  So far, these are quite nice touches but the camera app is where its implementation has gone wrong. Instead of the usual on-screen button layout, the Galaxy Note Edge has its shutter button and camera options lined up on the edge display. While this sounds like a good idea, it isn’t really practical in real life. Usually on a normal phone, you’ll rest the phone in between your pinky and second finger, with the thumb hovering on the shutter button that’s positioned towards the middle.  However for the Note Edge, it is quite a challenge since the top edge is lacking space to grip while the shutter button is on a slopping position at the top. For portrait shots, it is slightly better and if you’re taking a selfie, it is easier to take the shot by tapping on the heart rate sensor at the back.   The Galaxy Note Edge is high-end performer and that’s what you would expect from a flagship phablet. However after having tried out the Galaxy Note 4, we do notice that the Note Edge is a little bit laggy and it could be more processing power required for the edge or Samsung’s Exynos processor on the Note 4 is simply better.  In terms of battery life, we get an average of 15-17 hours on a single charge, which is identical with the Galaxy Note 4, but on-screen time is slightly less at about 3.5 hours, versus 5 hours on the Galaxy Note 4. This shouldn’t come as a surprise since the Galaxy Note Edge comes with a smaller battery capacity but it should be more than enough for most people. For heavy usage, you’ll probably need a charge before the day gets dark and the Note Edge also supports Adaptive Fast Charging that does 0 to 50% in 30 minutes.  The Galaxy Note Edge is a testament that Samsung is capable of making a curve display device that’s not for the sake of doing it. The unique usability of the edge display is commendable but it looks like there’s still a lot of work to be done to get it right. We can see a lot of potential of the edge display in isolation, and we reckon this could be an substitute for a smart watch display. For example, it would be great if we can read incoming messages in full which is quite useful in the cinema or during meetings.  With its upcoming Android 5.0 Lollipop update on the way, Samsung could still improve this further especially its camera interface. If cutting edge gadgets is what you seek and if you don’t mind spending the extra RM500 over the Note 4, the Galaxy Note Edge is an experiment worth trying out. With limited quantities to go around, the Galaxy Note Edge is more exclusive than your run of the mill Galaxy Note 4."
soyacincau,Gionee is launching a new slim phone and it might not be the thinnest,http://www.soyacincau.com/2015/02/06/gionee-is-launching-a-new-slim-phone-and-it-might-not-be-the-thinnest/,"Ginee Elife,Gionee,Gionee Elife S5.1,MWC 2015,Slim Phone",Mobile Devices,2015-02-06,"Gionee had made its name for having the slimmest smart phone last year with its  Elife S5.1  that’s only 5.1mm thin. After that, it didn’t take too long for Chinese rivals OPPO and Vivo to take slimmest to a whole new level with their  4.85mm R5  and  4.75mm X5 Max . Just a few days ago, another Chinese smart phone maker Coolpad has claimed to be the thinnest with a  4.70mm Ivvi K1 mini . With MWC 2015 happening in early March, Gionee will be introducing yet another ultra-slim device but it appears that they might have given up the pursuit for ultimate slimness. According to Oliver Sha, head of global marketing of Gionee, “The race to make the slimmest smartphone was getting out of hand. Going so slim is actually not benefiting user experience without the performance to back it up”. He added that to make a phone slimmer, some sacrifices had to be made such as removing the headphone jack, having a protruding camera, shortening of battery life and a thin frame which affects cooling and signal strength.  After being beaten in their own game, Gionee is looking at making slim phones that delivers a better user experience. Surely most users won’t mind having the extra mm if that means having more than a full day of usage on a single charge. The biggest problem that we have with these ridiculous slim phones is its short battery life with capacities ranging at the low end 1,800-2,000mAh. Then there’s the feel in the hands as they don’t give that much confidence when it’s picked up.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

The design still looks unchanged from what has been leaked prior which maintains the same One M8 look but with the squarish single main camera. However according to other sources the leaked images is far from the actual product, which leads us to believe that this could simply be a decoy to thwart  early leaks.  But since there is now a case the overall dimensions of the One M9 might be final but expect some design changes. So far we know the two new cases might be in  yellow and turquoise  on top of the more traditional black colour as seen in the photo above. Based on the description of the boom sound speaker and front facing camera, the One M9 might very  well look like this: Spec-wise, the HTC One M9 is rumoured to run on Qualcomm’s Octa-Core 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor with 3GB of RAM while the front display retains the similar 5″ screen with Full HD resolution. It will be juiced up with a slightly bigger 2,840mAh capacity battery and for imaging it will get a 20.7MP shooter at the back while selfies are taken with an Ultrapixel camera (presumably 4MP effective with 2.0 micron pixel size). Out of the box, you can count on them to be running on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop with a newer Sense 7.0 interface. [ SOURCE,   1 ]"

Thanks to renders from casemaker Verus, we pretty much have confirmation on some of the physical features of the Galaxy S6 which they claim is the real deal. Samsung’s next flagship is expected to have a unibody metal design, if the leaked schematics hold true. Instead of the flat edge that we’ve already seen on their Galaxy Alpha, Note 4 and A series smartphones, this new model seems to be going for the rounded edge look, not unlike that of an iPhone 6 or an Xperia Z3.  In terms of thickness, the schematics suggest that it would be 6.91mm which is a little bit thicker than the 6.3mm of the Galaxy A7. 
 Apart from that, the other noticeable difference is the placement of the heart rate sensor, which is placed vertically besides the camera which is similar to the Galaxy Alpha. On top of that, the phone looks to be getting two separate volume buttons and a slightly protruding camera module. The image below details the dimensions of the Galaxy S6. [ SOURCE ,  1 ,  2 ]"

While there aren’t that  many details  about the lady and the photo itself, speculation has it that she does indeed work at one such farms and she is tasked to download, install and uninstall certain apps over and over again to boost their ratings. Like a human machine. This is probably due to Apple preventing bots from artificially boosting App Store ratings and this looks like the most ‘legit’ way to simulate actual users. The original photo appeared on  Weibo  captioned “Hard-working App Store ranking manipulation employee.” The table sports what looks like rows upon rows of iPhone 5Cs and even looks like it’s purpose built for the task. Apparently you can pay to get to the top 10 free apps by paying RMB 70,000 (about RM39,822) and keeping it in that spot will cost you another RMB 405,000 (about RM230,400) a week which is a pretty ungodly sum. You can find the service on  Taobao , a popular China based C2C e-commerce site with dozens of vendors offering the service. Just bear in mind that this is a viral image and until there is official confirmation that it is what it is, we can only speculate. [ SOURCE ]"

Given that they’ve come a very long way since their first NX cameras, the NX500 is looking quite promising. Featuring roughly the same specifications as the NX1, the NX500 is more or less the same camera that’s been made small enough that you can almost slip it into your pocket. It has the very same 28 MP APS-C sensor, DRIMe V processor, autofocus system and 4K video recording capabilities, which is quite amazing for a camera of this size. It will also have a tiltable 3-inch Super AMOLED Touch panel out the back, an ISO of up to 51,200 as well as a healthy amount of connectivity options namely WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth. Still, it would have some downsides as a result from it’s small form factor. For starters, the NX500 will not have the 120 fps Full HD video enjoyed by the NX1 but will still record up to 60 fps and burst mode has been downsized from 15 fps to 9 fps due it not being possible to scale down the shutter mechanics. The compact will also be lacking it’s larger sibling’s weather-sealing too, so you won’t have the added benefit of water and dust resistance which is a pretty big bummer. However, you still will be getting an extremely versatile compact camera for what it’s worth, though whether or not it will perform exactly as the NX 1 is up to debate, especially when it comes down to the handling but that will have to wait till we get our own hands on it. We aren’t sure when the Malaysian release will be yet but the camera will start shipping in March this year at the price of $800 (about RM2852) in a kit that comes with a 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 power zoom lens and will be available in black, brown and white.

What you’re looking at is the ASUS ZenPower 9600, which like its name suggests, offers 9,600mAh of battery capacity that’s good enough to charge a  ZenFone 5  up to 3 times.  In terms of design, it looks quite familiar with a popular  cheap and good power bank  that’s constantly being sold out in minutes. The exterior gets a metal looking finish and it comes with a variety of colours. Instead of a full rounded edge, the ZenPower looks more squarish. Unlike the Mi 10,400mAh Power Bank which uses 4x 2,600mAh batteries, the ZenPower 9600 utilises 3x higher capacity 3,200mAh battery cells. As a result, it is more compact and it is lighter too at 215g (Mi 10,400mAh: 250g).  For better peace of mind, the ZenPower gets 11 layers of protection, which is 2 more than Xiaomi’s 9 layers. At the top, you get the usual full sized USB output and micro USB input ports, 4 LED battery indicators and a large power/status button. They didn’t mention the output rating, but we are guessing that it should be pushing 2 Amps at least. If you’re afraid of scratching your precious power bank, there are colourful rubber sleeves available as well. So far there’s no pricing details and it isn’t clear if they would be selling this outside of China/Taiwan.  [  SOURCE ,  VIA  ]"

If you’re curious about the price, the Mi Pad carries a RM799 price tag and it comes only in white with 16GB storage capacity. The price isn’t too far off from its mainland China’s 1,299 CNY pricing which is about RM745. To recap on the specs, the Mi Pad comes with an iPad mini 3 spec’ced 7.9″ 2048×1536 IPS display that pushes a pixel density of 326ppi and it is toughen with Gorilla Glass 3. Under the hood it gets a Quad-core 2.2 GHz Nvidia Tegra K1 chipset with 192 CUDA cores GPU and is mated to 2GB of RAM. If its built in 16GB storage isn’t enough, the Mi Pad comes with a microSD slot that support cards up to 128GB. It also gets a 8MP BSI main camera, 5MP front shooter and a 6,700mAh Lithium Ion Polymer Battery. Connectivity wise, it gets WiFi 802.11 ac and Bluetooth 4.0. Overall the Mi Pad is 8.5mm thin and weighs 360g, which is bulkier than Apple’s iPad mini. The Mi Pad will be available during Xiaomi’s upcoming flash sales, which could be taking place ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season. To know this tablet better, you can check out our  hands-on and first impressions  post. At RM799, you could also get the  first gen iPad mini  which runs on a lower 1024×768 pixels resolution display and a dated processor from the  iPad 2 . Arguably, the iPad could be better as a tablet with its larger library of tablet optimised apps. If better hardware is what you’re looking for, you can’t go wrong with the Mi Pad.

Having just unveiled their  Cortex-A72  mobile processor reference design, the new chip promises to give a huge boost to graphics and general processing your mobile. The updates to the chip includes optimizations for 30 percent more memory performance and  up to 80 percent speedier graphics, roughly makes it about 3.5 times more powerful than it’s ancestor the Cortex-A15 chip. It would also be capable of recording 4K video at 120 frames per second, which is a huge improvement over the 30 frames that most smartphones are only capable of. On top of that, the processor will also consume about 75 percent less power than it’s predecessor the A15 at a similar level of performance, with graphics only needing about 40 percent less than what it was used to. The Cortex-A72 is understandably built to take full advantage of ARM’s big.LITTLE tech that switches CPU cores depending on your mobile’s workload as well as 64-bit platforms like  Android’s Lollipop OS . So it’s fully possible that mobiles possessing this chip will likely have longer battery life as well as be immensely good at handling gaming. Huawei (HiSilicon), MediaTek and Rockchip have already signed up to make A72-based processors so you can something out of this soon but ARM isn’t expecting to ship the hardware till sometime in 2016.

For 2015, Pebble will face great challenges as the Android Wear players would be releasing their 2nd generation of devices and  Apple’s entry  into the smart watch game in April. To keep up wih the times, Pebble’s CEO Eric Migicovsky shared that they will be introducing new products this year along with a new software platform that has yet to be seen on smart watches. He added that they have found a new framework which they would be using as an interaction model on the watch. While apps would continue to exist, they won’t be the main focus on the platform.  Since it had launched  Pebble Steel  early last year, they had hired some members from the LG’s webOS TV team for the purpose of building its next generation of smart watches. Migicovsky didn’t reveal too much of its new device but it looks like they are targeting to announce the new lineup towards the 2nd half of this year. At the moment, the Pebble watch is going at US$99 (about RM358) while its Steel edition is priced at US$199 (about RM720). They do accept  international orders  and they ship to Malaysia for free via Standard Mail. [  SOURCE  ]"

Interestingly Meizu isn’t resting on their laurels and they are about to push a new FlymeOS version that’s based on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop. Owners of their current  MX4  and  MX4 Pro  are said to be able to try out their open-beta release of their new OS sometime in March next month. While this sounds like good news for those wanting the latest Android version, do note that FlymeOS would be heavily modified from the usual UI that you’re familiar with. Far from the usual stock experience, the FlymeOS interface is very simplified, almost similar to iOS and it uses a number of gesture actions for its vital functions. Physically it gets a capacitive home button and there’s also a dynamic on-screen buttons to navigate around. It is said that the Lollipop based FlymeOS will be developed side by side for the MX4 and MX4 Pro, and the final version should be released simultaneously for both models. [  SOURCE   2 ,  VIA  ]"

If you’re curious on the actual design, a  Korean site  has put together a possible render of the upcoming Galaxy S Edge, a curved display version of the Galaxy S6 based on the  original silhouette teaser .  The render looks quite legit and it appears to be similar with the reverse side of Xiaomi’s  Mi Note  that comes with a  rear 3D glass  with double curve edges, flanked by a smooth flowing metal frame. The power button appears to be positioned at the top, which is a trade off of having the display flowing on the sides.  For comparison, you can view the official Samsung Unpacked 2015 teaser image after the break. Do you like what you see? Leave your thoughts in the comments below. [  VIA  ]"
